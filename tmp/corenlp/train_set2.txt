2	306 Lunar Landing Plates Year Released: 1979 Piece Count: 2 Minifigs: 0 List Price: unknown As part of the Classic Space Collection, Lego offered two sets of moon plates.

2	One was a set of two crater plates, and the other, this very useful Landing Plate set.

2	Not much to review, but worth sharing a few images: The landing plate: And T-Plate: The two plates connect to form this very nice Classic Space landing platform: Set 497, Galaxy Explorer included the landing platform, but the one that I had was lighter in color than the one contained in this set (at least the yellow circle).

2	Future Lego space sets could benefit by having similar road plates.

2	Share your thoughts.

3	These are my only space base plates from Classic Space.

3	Actually, with only 2 plates, I could not do much serious expansion with it.

3	Instead, I merged it with my old city baseplates, and used it as a docking station for scientific purposes or restricted facilities that is guarded by the police.

3	These baseplates are very useful and is suited for creating a space command center, up in the space.  

1	These are pretty good, but I think they look too much like the standard town roads from that period.

1	I like the black space plates from the early 90s better (6710).

3	Awesome!

3	I had not seen these before.

3	They would really make nice plates for a SW Death Star scene.

3	Thanks for sharing.

1	first, what i liked sooooo much was the cover of these plates, with this large picture of a classic space scene.

1	I still have a '306' misb just to keep that nice feeling of taking it out of a plastic box, and look at it... there were different versions of the cover though.

1	second, the markings of the landing platform changed at some point.

1	i'd have to check it later when i'm at home, think it had something to do with the interupted yellow lines...

2	You make a very good point there.

2	I've used these plates to represent restricted areas, and even as simple airport runways, beyond their space uses.

2	I never liked the black plates (they were during my dark ages anyway, so I've never really seen one up close), but I have seen them used in a Death Star display as suggested and it turned out fairly well.

3	These plates are great in setting up your space base and giving your ships a place to land.

3	My favorite, though, is the lunar crater plate, which I use to death in my comic.

1	Why pay $350 Dollars, just download the instructions on buy the pieces off Bricklink.

1	This is was I did when I wanted to create the Blacktron II in the Futuron colour scheme.

1	Also I tend to like both sets of base plates, I bought the black ones myself and they were of great use but there more for creating the idea of a city or space station, something more completely man made.

1	The gray ones give a better look of the roads being laid over bare rock especially when you introduce the plates with the craters.

1	I would love to see a 48*48 baseplate with roads through them which would allow more building space on the side and maybe some craters.

1	Also 48*48 baseplates with craters but a few different kinds to create more or a realistic look and less of a repeating pattern.

1	And with all those rocks you have to put everything up on supports, much better looking bases then.

1	That's the problem; the instructions aren't anywhere to be found, not that I've seen.

1	The set does seem to have some rare parts, but I doubt $350 worth.

3	Oh how I love these plates.

3	Afew years ago I found a local retail store with about 6-7 sets of these in their basement warehouse I was given special access to (along with MANY other old space goodies.. hehe..) I love the things, I have loads, and I've used them for multiple space bases and battles.

3	Along with afew grey crater plates and the large grey plates (1.5x the size of a normal baseplate) you can get quite a monorail layout going.

3	*sigh* I should really clean up and get one set up again, so I can take some pictures!

2	Wow, nice.

2	You probably have enough to make that scene on the box picture.

2	I got one pack off ebay a while ago and have another octagon plate from the Blacktron 6988 base.

2	I'm building my carrier MOC around one but don't have anything planned for the others.

2	These baseplates are still relatively common on ebay for their age.

2	I see MISB packs on there every few weeks and they tend to sell for around $20.

2	The older kind (in the OP) are much harder to come by.

1	By looking at the pictures used to display this set I've a sneaky suspicion it did not come with instructions but meant for the pictures to be ideas.

1	The whole set was suppose to teach children to use their imagination, giving them instructions would somewhat defeat this while trying to figure how to build things from looking at pictures would be a much better educational experience.

2	I also love these plates!

2	I build a lot with them (e.g.

2	this ).

2	Unfortunately they are not available in bley ...

2	But I don't wanna use my imagination!

1	Year Released: 1976 Piece Count: 53 Minifigs: 2 LEGO brought out floating boats quite early, and in many ways the first were the best.

1	(I'll explain why later...) This set in particular is interesting as it came out in two versions; one that includes the first minifigs and another that included the non-armless type.

1	(Set 709.)

1	The police signs are stickers, and are in surprisingly good condition considering the age of the set.

1	(I am missing one sticker on the front though.)

1	Note the Technic Bush and Axel; they are the old type.

1	The position of the second figure is not a mistake; I think he's supposed to be sitting down....

1	The first boats out by LEGO needed a weighted keel to prevent them.... keeling over.

1	(I have tested this!)

1	I suspect this is because of the density of the old hulls and the flat bottom... but I could be wrong.

1	(It can't be just because of the flat bottom as the new cargo ship doesn't need one.)

1	The keel in detail.

1	The bottom extension is for a motor.

1	(Not included, nor made by LEGO at the time.)

1	The keel had longer studs.

1	Even now it holds extra firmly.

1	This is why I prefer the old design.

1	You can extend or shorten the hulls as you please, or even insert other LEGO in the middle.

1	You can easily add wheels or any other piece to the bottom of these hulls.

1	I wish they would go back to this idea; the 4+ hulls were of this concept but were too wide.

1	(Probably so the keel wasn't needed.)

1	The old minifigs aside from having odd feet and no arms had a normal stud as the neck.

1	Thus when you turn the head it tends to come off.

1	I love this set!

3	Great review Sinner.

3	I own the later version, 709 released in 1977.

3	Mine no longer has decals though.

3	The variations were minimal.

3	It looks like your boat is in really good shape considering it's >30 years old.

3	Excellent review!

2	I know; I got it for a song on eBay.

2	Most 1970s sets don't seem to be in much demand...

2	How about "These Policemen are unarmed?"

1	Nice review Sinner!

1	The old sets...

1	I donÂ´t know - every old set, especially equipped with the old non-moveable arms minifigs look very odd nowadays.

1	I agree with you with the hull shape and its possibility to be extended, but every other aspect, the lack of detail, the keel itself (you canÂ´t float it in shallow water) keeps me from rating it higher than 3/10.

1	In my opninion the best police boat so far is 4021 *click to enlarge*

3	I love those minifigs, they'd go for alot on ebay I bet.

3	Great boat as well, I love the old hull design.

3	This set showed what potential variations on the standard brick had back then.

3	I think that TLG was still finding its legs back then and learning new things so this is a solid set for the year it was released.

3	Nice review Sinner.

1	Thank you for the nice review, Sinner.

1	This set just isn't a good example, that's all.

1	OH, and I also agree with you about that police boat.

1	However, the newer one in the CITY line is also great, IMO.

1	The only thing that weighs against it is the giant size, which makes it feel awkward in more classic towns.

1	LOL!

1	I can't help but smile everytime I see the quote on this thread..... don't worry these police are armless!

1	LOL

3	well what to say?

3	i got this boat late 70s, when we were on our way to Italy to spend the holidays there.

3	My parents always needed to keep my quiet during the 3-day trip, and the best way to do that was to buy me a lego set...

3	I got this one in a gas station in Germany.

3	As far as I remember Italy didn't have lego sets, so a gas station close to the Italian border but still in Germany or Austria was very often their last chance.

3	I often saw large quantities of lego sets in those gas stations though... i remember seeing yellow castle and... the galaxy explorer, standing on a shelf.

3	It would be my birthday 1-3 week(s) later so i always made sure they knew what to buy for me...

3	Quote I often saw large quantities of lego sets in those gas stations though... i remember seeing yellow castle and... the galaxy explorer, standing on a shelf.

3	These were the times...

3	Although I donÂ´t recall Lego sets in fuel stations in the past I would appreciate to see Lego "on the go" now.

3	ItÂ´s holiday time and I have two sons, you know.

2	So, you've been bitten by the classic bug too, Sinner.

2	Great review; but one would think arms would come in handy (pun intended) when you are a police officer, right?

2	It's a shame that many of the original figs must now be forced to stand looking like they have their hands in their pockets, eh?

2	I have no idea where I was going with that last sentence...

3	As you may have seen in my topic in general LEGO discussion, I received a bunch of old LEGO from my step-grandmother-in-law.

3	Among the bricks were instructions and pieces for an almost complete set 345 from 1969.

3	I was very excited to find this out, so I put it together.

3	I recently took it apart and re-assembled it, taking photographs along the way for the sake of Eurobricks.

3	So, without further ado, set 345: House With Car.

3	First off is the car.

3	This was still constructed in the bucket of bricks I received, so I never took it apart: Next I'll show you the instructions.

3	Lots of added bricks per step, which was fun.

3	However, the angle of the instructions sometimes made it difficult to find where things were supposed to go.

3	The in-build shots.

3	Finally, an all-around view of the finished set.

3	Sadly, I don't have much time to post more pictures or thoughts.

3	However, I'll try to come back and update the review later this week.

3	Until then, enjoy!

3	Nice review, 'Mariko'!

3	This set is way past my time.

3	The baseplate is okay (though I hate those dots).

3	The car is pretty cool too...

3	Great review.

3	I never had this set, but it looks nice.

3	I really like the checker pattern near the big window.

2	Way before my time, too--in fact, this set came out twenty years before I was born!

2	The baseplate doesn't actually have dots--I'm not sure if they were there once, and then rubbed off (a possibility, as the studs are rather smoother than I imagine they once were), or if this particular one didn't have the dots.

2	This set also shows that the difficulty LEGO has in doing vehicle scale isn't new.

2	The house is the perfect size for microfigures from the LEGO Games; however, the car is massive--over twice as tall as a microfig!

3	Great Review Mariko!

3	This set is way before my time too.

3	I like how LEGO used to create simple one story houses instead of the really tall house that we see in today's Town Theme, such as 8403 City House.

3	One story houses such as 345 just look more realistic to my eyes.

3	The simplistic, minimalism vibe that I get with this set is something that is hard to find in today's much more detailed sets (although, trust me, I love love love today's detailed sets).

3	- The Brick is Epic

3	Image Link from Brickset I thought I would do a pic review of the 1st Lego Castle, The Yellow Castle, #375- released in 1978.

3	First, let me say that this set was truly "ahead of it's time".

3	It introduced new building concepts (such as the hinge and new figs (most were still the armless, faceless mini-figs during this time).

3	This set introduced me to Castle which was my first real favorite theme.

3	I enjoyed breaking it out from the garage and building it again.

3	The majority of the pieces are 1x1, 1x2, 1x3, 1x4, 1x6, and 1x8 standard yellow bricks.

3	The set also includes yellow 1x4, 1x6x2, and 1x8x2 arches, yellow 2x2, 2x3, and 2x4 bricks, various grey plates, 1x2 black inverted slopes, red drawbridge pieces, two classic red castle doors, 8 hinges (2 for each corner), and a few other nifty pieces including six red 1x1 windows.

3	A complete inventory is available at Peeron: 375 Inventory.

3	A view from the front.

3	The drawbridge is 6x8.

3	The front tower stands 12 1/3 bricks high (plenty of room for horses).

3	The drawbridge does work.

3	The string (originally black) is attached to the opposite side between a plate and the arches.

3	The right side of the castle (identical to the left).

3	I've always loved the 2x2x3 sloped bricks (and corner pieces): The back.

3	I love these red doors.

3	A 1x4 brick attached to the other side of the baseplate keeps intruders out.

3	That banner was the original sticker piece.

3	Notice the wear.

3	The rear tower, largest of the towers: And backside: Two hinges at each of the corners allow the corners to open for playability: Before opening: Open: Lots of arches add to the detail of the inner walls: Inner front: This set included 14 figs (how about that for quantity).

3	Unfortunately, I peeled off worn stickers from the shields and the breast plates years ago.

3	The blue castle guards and knights are the keepers of the castle.

3	I still think that these helmets are the best Lego ever made.

3	They just look good.

3	The black and white knights: And the red knights: I've always prefered to use the black and red guards and flags from the knight's joust set(s): Conclusion The Yellow Castle is truly a classic set and I'm so glad I kept the pieces to this together after all these years.

3	If you have a chance to buy one or even obtain the set instructions, it's worth building and wouldn't be difficult to substitute grey or other colors.

3	I hope you enjoyed this review and feel free to share your comments.

3	nice review!

3	i haven't built yellow castle for many years, but i do remember the fun i had building it when i was young... Yellow castle just opened up an entire new world for me... also, i liked all the alternate models on the box :oD wish i still had that...

2	There's two alternates on the back of the instructions and as I recall, some sort of bridge on the inner fold or back of box.

2	I threw away the box to this set years ago- just lucky to still have all the pieces.

2	With standard pieces, you can build all these alternates and many more.

2	That's why I don't particularly care for the new castles (like Vladek's).

2	They make building so difficult and duplicate pieces are so limited.

2	Here's an old shot of the castle in the city that it use to guard.

2	We played for hours back in these days,

3	Great review.

3	It is nice to see an in-depth photo review of this set.

3	I especially love the last picture of your old city!

3	It certainly does bring back memories...

3	Yup that is very very nice..I wish I had been alive back then :D Well ill never have a chance to own something like this so this is as close ill get to it!

3	Thanks for showing me the greatness....

2	Question for you guys, what's the best way to clean Lego?

2	I was noticing that the baseplates and gray plates to this set are very dusty and could use a good cleaning.

2	Mild soap water soak?

2	Is there a better way?

3	Toothbrush and mild soap - and lots of time gently scrubbing a cleaning.

3	And great review - I love that set *wub* *wub* I'm sorry that You seem to miss the stickers - If You find somewhere to download printable copies of them please let me know *satis* KimT

2	They do need to be re-sized.

2	You could do the same in cm by converting to 1.5 cm wide.

2	so you're using two layers (stickers) doesn't that make it very thick?

2	Here's a shot of a custom forestman.

2	These really work well: I'm using just regular sticker paper.

2	How do you stick transparent plastic on top?

2	i guess it's easiest to put the entire shield on a transparent sticker and cut the edges.

2	i would also do that with the white stickers, because now you can still see the gray edges of the shield.

2	Perhaps you can make a bigger black, or brown in the other case, outline.

2	you also wouldn't be able to see if the sticker is exactly in the middle...

2	Quote so you're using two layers (stickers) doesn't that make it very thick?

2	Not really.

2	I think it works out very fine.

2	1.

2	Now this doesn't mean you can never revive an old thread, but just do it when there's a reason :-) Yes, I believe it is the oldest.

3	Yes, I hear you younger FOLs say this meant we had less variety at the time, but at least we did not have to go on a frenzy to get them all in just 1 or 2 years before they disappeared (to re-appear on the secondary market at crazy prices).

3	Anyway, I also realise this set is older than me by 5 years (at least the first boxes of this set).

3	I think my parents bought it when I was something like 1/2 year old, or even before, as my Father really liked the Hobby Set line and took any chance to get one, you know, for the kids, when theyâ€™ll be old enough to play with themâ€¦ I am really happy my Father did it, too.

3	As a matter of fact, this has always been one of my favourite non-minifigure scale sets.

3	I know younger eyes will look on it and wonder how we could love and enjoy a model like this, so blocky and rough.

3	Just remember this was the best TLG designers could do with the bricks available at the time.

3	Enough about memories; letâ€™s start with the review!

3	The Box Front The front of the box (here cut and folded to save space) shows the Harley Davidson 1000cc in all its glory upon a nice town landscape.

3	I really appreciate how TLG box designers used a real life photo of the model in a real life environment to give this Hobby Set a better background.

3	Moreover, the landscape does not distract the eye, even with its lights, since the focus is strongly set on the motorbike itself.

3	Back (and sides) The back of the box shows the model on a more neutral background and from another angle.

3	We can see the stickers in place (take a good look at them here, because I did not apply them).

3	The right side we also see a pic of the set from the front, and one with a child playing with it.

3	In this latter shot, the model rests upon a nice black box with a Harley Davidson sign on it.

3	I frankly do not remember if this was some sort of tray or smaller box within the LEGO one or if it is meant for publicity only.

3	Another thing we can notice on the right-most side of the box is a white band, right below the LEGO logo, sporting the sign â€˜Designed for experienced LEGO buildersâ€™ in various languages.

3	All in all, a really well done and professional job.

3	Contents Inside This set includes a number of parts in mainly Black, White and Light Grey.

3	Some Blue and Yellow add nice touches of colour to the total.

3	The partsâ€™ selection is not mind-blowing, as most of the pieces had been in production, in these same colours for years.

3	Anyway, Iâ€™d like to focus on a couple of details: The Milky White Technic axles as well as the Red Technic Bush Old 2 are among my favourite parts.

3	The bushes, in particular, are quite useful to build more sturdy looking tubes than what can be achieved with the newer and slimmer ones.

3	It would seem that the tile pieces appeared in the â€˜without groveâ€™ version as a standard and in the â€˜with groveâ€™ version as alternates (see Bricklink inventory).

3	Notice, though that the box (above) and instructionsâ€™ (below) pictures all show the â€˜with groveâ€™ variety.

3	As said, there are no re-coloured parts in this set.

3	New pieces The few new molds used in this set are: Black and White Slope, Inverted 45 2 x 2 Old Type with Round Bottom Tube, Black Technic, Brick 1 x 2 with Hole Type II and Red Hinge Plate 2 x 4 with Articulated Joint â€“ Male and Female.

3	The most interesting piece from this lot, as many of you will have noticed is the Technic, Brick 1 x 2 with Hole Type II.

3	This kind of technic brick was use during 1976 and 1977 only.

3	It would seem TLG tried a new design variant, which did not meet success and was later replaced with the standard bricks again.

3	Nonetheless, Iâ€™m sure that people who own these bricks like them for the unusual design and the possibilities they offer into adding details to their creations.

3	Instructions Cover â€“ As usual, the instructions are not organised in the form of a booklet, but they consist of a folded double printed sheet.

3	The â€˜coverâ€™ shows again the same shot as the front of the box, with bigger LEGO logo and set number and without the other additional information.

3	â€˜Back coverâ€™ â€“ Here we see the full name of the set: Harley-Davidson FLH 1200.

3	This makes me wonder: why is this set known as 394 Harley Davidson 1000cc when it is indeed a 1200cc?

3	Anyway, what really makes me love this page is the list of stats below the photo, and in particular these two lines: H.P.

3	(?

3	)/(not given).

3	This calls for just one question: why did Harley-Davidson not release this info?

3	My opinion is that since this is a motorbike built for the Police, they did not have permission to share the specifications on the motor, which was probably customised either by Harley-Davidson upon request or by the Police themselves.

3	â€˜Random pageâ€™ â€“ As expected, no call-outs here, but the build is pretty straight forward and does not need them (apart for one passage weâ€™ll see later).

3	The colours are easy to tell apart (in the end there is no Dark Grey in this set that could be confused with Black).

3	Again, notice how the instructions include the â€˜with groveâ€™ tiles and not the older ones.

3	Maybe this was changed during the long time this set stayed in production?

3	The â€˜last pageâ€™ shows other four models included in the Hobby Set line.

3	Unfortunately, I own only one of them: the 396 Thatcher Perkins Locomotive.

3	Indeed, I would have liked to have them all!

3	Building Start The handle bars look a bit too squared to me, but itâ€™s just a minor feature, and the overall shape is still good in my opinion.

3	Notice the red hinge plate, which will be almost totally hidden in the finished model (see below), and the blue tiles which work as indicators.

3	The first steps, used to build the front wheel and windshield are really easy, until you get to the wheel.

3	In facts, the instructions do not show clearly all the pieces needed for it, and I found myself with a â€˜floatingâ€™ wheel for the absence of one of the Red Technic Bush Old 2 on one side (the one not visible on the instructions, of course).

3	Not a big deal, but something that could have been done better.

3	Motor and seat The second part of the build includes the motor, seat and â€˜saddle bagsâ€™.

3	The technique used for the motor, or better the radiator, is very clever.

3	To get the ridged feel, TLG designers used 4 Light Grey plates stuck one on the other but not completely in contact.

3	This way, the studs, while keeping the plates in position, keep them raised from one another at the same time.

3	The Yellow round bricks add some details and colour touches to this predominantly Light Grey parts of the vehicle.

3	The use of the Engine, Smooth Small, 1 x 2 Side Plates for the exhaust pipes, while quite clever, still looks a bit strange to me.

3	Iâ€™m mostly used to see them in airplanes, helicopters and spaceships.

3	â€˜Saddle-bagsâ€™, a simple build for one of the iconic parts of this motorcycle.

3	Here you see them in place, as well as get a look at the finished seat.

3	I like how LEGO designers managed to make its shape with just a few quite big bricks.

3	The â€˜saddle bagsâ€™ are a really nice touch, and they work perfectly when compared to the original.

3	This is the rear wheel.

3	As said before, only when you get to this passage in the instruction you get a real understanding of how the front wheel is supposed to be mounted as well.

3	Careful readers will notice how this is not one of the original wheels in this set.

3	The original ones were mounted using the Technic, Gear Expert Builder 9 Tooth.

3	Unfortunately, I could only find one of them in my collection, an itâ€™s used as the front wheel.

3	By adding the rear wheel (which is shown from a better angle in the instructions), we complete the model.

3	Notice how the two technic bricks supporting the wheel are held in position by two 2x1 plates.

3	I think this was a bad case of â€˜building by compartmentsâ€™ mentality: if TLG designers had considered this a bit more, they would have used 2 4x1 plates instead of 4 2x1.

3	On the other hand, this is not the worst case I have seen in a LEGO set, and they keep up the tradition nowadays too.

3	Finished set Front And here it is our fancy Police Harley-Davidson!

3	Indeed, the front looks blocky and quite horrible to our eyes, but again, it was almost the best that could be done at the time.

3	I only wish they had made it a little less bulky, even though this build is clearly thought to give better stability to the wheel.

3	The Blue tiles work nicely to emphasise the indicators, the slightly unsightly red plate is normally covered by the plate sticker and the windshield, albeit being hard to see through, is nicely shaped.

3	Back The back side is less detailed than the front, but shows the red light and antenna which are typical of the Police motorbikes from this period.

3	How many times have we seen this angle in the chase scenes from TV shows like â€œCHiPsâ€?

3	Side All in all, this model looks pretty sturdy (apart for the antenna, which falls off all too easily) and detailed, especially considering the limited variety of parts available and used at the time.

3	They even got so far to put a 2x2 tile as kick-stand to display it without fear of it falling on the sides!

3	Bonus images Size comparison?

3	What I never understood about this set is what scale it is meant to be.

3	I mean, it is clearly not minifig-scale, and it could not be technic-fig-scale (those came later).

3	But it is not even Miniland scale!

3	Moreover, the only other model with the same scale is the other Hobby Set motorbike, as the cars have a scale of their own and the Thatcher uses still another one!

3	Final comments Overall, this is a great set for collectors of old models and motorbike fans, or both.

3	It does not sport a huge variety of bricks, but was a good choice at the time, and even if the result is matter-of-fact blocky when compared to the original, it implements some good solutions to minimise the LEGO brick appearance and maximise the similarity as much as possible.

3	Design & Colour scheme â€“ 9/10 (The design is as accurate as possible, apart for the front mudguard maybe, and the colours are completely in line for a Police vehicle.

3	The solutions and details included in this set justify the â€˜Expert buildersâ€™ label and add to the appearance, and, why not, playability of the model.)

3	Parts - 8/10 (Not a huge selection, and very few new molds.

3	Nonetheless, a good source of Black and White standard parts for MOCs and one of the few sources for the extra rare Technic, Brick 1 x 2 with Hole Type II pieces.)

3	Playability - 9/10 (A sturdy model which can take some serious play and swoosh-ing without falling apart.

3	The easily detachable antenna and the lack of an appropriate scale interaction with most other models make it lose one point, though.)

3	Build - 7/10 (Pretty straight forward, with few nice solutions and an already mentioned slightly obscure passage in the instructions.)

3	Price - 5/10 (Like most older models, especially the Hobby Set and Model Team ones, this set can be found at reasonable prices only rarely.

3	Most of the times, people are asked shameful prices for such a smallish set.)

3	Overall: 8/10 Very good.

3	As always, questions, comments, and pic requests welcome!

3	Great job on this review of a unique and rare set LuxorV!

3	Considering the year it was released, this must have been a cool set back then.

3	Even up to now with all the specialized pieces and advanced building techniques, I could still appreciate the beauty of this brickbuilt Harley-Davidson police motorbike.

3	The various elements are instantly recognizable and it even has the unusual 'partly-stacked' plates technique for the motor.

3	Overall, I'd say this is an above average set that is a must-have for any hardcore LEGO collector.

3	Great review!

3	The set is really nice, I love that the front of the motercycle can turn and the engine is just beautiful, with its half stacked bricks like KielDaMan said.

3	The price used or new is quite a bit, but there is a good variety of bricks here like the bricks inside the wheels.

3	Did you get this set from your father?

3	Great review LuxorV!

3	LuxorV this is an awesome review.

3	The classic-ness of this set is just lovely.

3	It's so easy to just fall in love with this set.

3	You're review is outstanding as well, the pictures are so clear and the review is just solid.

3	You've really polished your reviewing skills

3	Wow, talk about illegal connections, eh?

3	Great review.

3	I really like this set, even for its age

3	Thanks for the feedback guys!

3	Indeed this is a great set, and I'm very attached to it.

3	As far as I remember, I got it for say my 2nd birthday, I think But it is not my first LEGO set.

3	You'll learn more on this in my next planned review

3	LuxorV, this is a well written presentation on this LEGO Vintage review.

3	I never knew the existence of this set and even though the design is not part of the modern LEGO design concept but the overall appeal back in the 1970s certainly appeal to many.

3	I could not mind to own such vintage LEGO model and put them on display and potray as if it was a chart of evolution of LEGO motorbikes.

3	Thanks for sharing and I can't wait to find out your next review.

3	Thanks 'LuxorV' for this review of such a classic old Lego set and I do remember seeing these in a catalogue years ago.

3	Excellent brick-built police cycle, I think it's time Lego did another one eh ?

3	Brick On Ride On Everyone !

3	Great review for a classic model.

3	I love it.

3	Theme: Hobby Sets Set name: Thatcher Perkins Locomotive Set Number: 396 Price (new): 369-450 $, 258-314 Euro Price (used): 100-355 $, 45-250 Euro Pieces: 434 Year of release: 1976 Links: Peeron, Bricklink and Brickset My Father assures me this is the very first LEGO set I ever got.

3	In facts, he gave it to me as a present for my first half year.

3	Of course, that is to say he bought it for himself and used me as the official excuse!

3	When I grew up, at first I found it to be quite boring: no minifigures, limited play features; in the end, it was just a locomotive!

3	It soon went to forgotten-land.

3	Then, when I was about 10 years old, I one day found again the instructionsâ€™ â€˜bookletâ€™ and saw this bright coloured big steam engine, and I suddenly wanted to build it again.

3	It would seem I finally got to the right age (at least for me) to appreciate the design of this great set.

3	But enough about memories; letâ€™s start with the review!

3	The Box Front The front of the box (here cut and folded to save space) shows the Thatcher Perkins Locomotive in all its glory upon a nice countryside landscape.

3	I really appreciate how TLG box designers used a real life environment made of sand, gravel and pebbles to give this Hobby Set a better background.

3	Moreover, the landscape does not distract the eye, since the focus is strongly set on the locomotive itself.

3	The box measures about 39.5 x 24.5 x 5.5 centimetres, or 15.56 x 9.65 x 2.17 inches.

3	This is more or less the size of the 4840 - The Burrow, or the Advent Calendars.

3	Back (and sides) The back of the box shows the model on a more neutral background and from another angle.

3	We can see the stickers in place (take a good look at them here, because I did not apply them).

3	The right side we also see a pic of the set from the (3/4) back, and one with a child playing with it.

3	In this latter shot, the model rests upon a nice black box with a Thatcher Perkins sign on it.

3	Unlike the Harley Davidson 1000cc set, the Thatcher Perkins does not have the sign â€˜Designed for experienced LEGO buildersâ€™ for some reason.

3	Contents Inside This set includes a large number of parts, mainly Black, Blue and Red, with some nice Yellow to lighten it up more.

3	Parts of interest The partsâ€™ selection is not exceptional, but weâ€™ll see this set includes some unique pieces which have not been in LEGO sets for long years since the 1980s, like the very nice Black Plate, Modified 1 x 2 with Steam Engine Cylinder, Flat Surfaces, Black Train Wheel Spoked for Motor and the Red Train Steam Drive Rod Holder - Train Steam Drive Rod group.

3	The Wheel Spoked Large, as beautiful as they were, saw the light from the production line for the last time in 1976!

3	The only new mold used in this set is the Black and Blue Slope, Inverted 45 2 x 2 Old Type with Round Bottom Tube.

3	As you can see in the above picture, this locomotive was designed to work (well, be played with) on all kind of surfaces, so the wheels sport tyres.

3	In this picture you can see how they look without the tyres.

3	Of course, builders can use the Thatcher Perkins on their brick-built tracks.

3	Another group of interesting parts are shown in this pic: Red Wheel Spoked 2 x 2 with Stud (and tyre), Black Brick, Modified 2 x 4 with Wheels Holder Old, Clear Bottom and Yellow Minifig, Head (Plain) - Stud Solid.

3	Many newer fans will not be familiar with the last two parts: they were standard fare in a number of sets between the 1960s and early 1990s, but then (unfortunately) they were taken out of production.

3	To be fair, the replacement of the Black Brick, Modified 2 x 4 with Wheels Holder Old, Clear Bottom with the standard technic parts was probably due to the fact that the metal pin used to connect the wheels to these bricks had a shameful tendency at getting off the wheel.

3	Too bad it could not be fixed and these parts kept in production.

3	For those interested, here is a picture of the DSS, courtesy of Peeron.

3	Instructions Cover â€“ As usual, the instructions are not organised in the form of a booklet, but they consist of a folded double printed sheet.

3	The â€˜coverâ€™ shows again the same shot as the front of the box.

3	â€˜Back coverâ€™ â€“ Here we see the name of the set and some additional information, like the year when the first Thatcher Perkins started working (1863) and the type (4-6-0) of this locomotive, which, as shown in the image, is related to the number and position of the wheels.

3	On a side note, the pencil signs on the sides of the sheet were made by my Father while counting the parts in the set.

3	â€˜Random pageâ€™ â€“ As expected, no call-outs here, but the build is pretty straight forward and does not need them.

3	The colours are easy to tell apart.

3	Full page â€“ As you may have noticed, all the building steps are drawn on one side of the â€˜bookletâ€™, making it more properly an instructionsâ€™ sheet.

3	What really makes this â€˜instruction bookletâ€™ stand out in my eyes is the fact that it is indeed a poster: the building steps are all on one side, while the other is a bigger image of the completed set with the name Thatcher Perkins in yellow enclosed in an old styled red tag.

3	Building Start The build starts with the base of the locomotive, putting the 10 wheels in place and strengthening the engine.

3	Notice the use of this â€˜illegalâ€™ technique to build the bumpers.

3	LEGO, as we all know can be a tricky medium to build with, and some details need special solutions to be completed.

3	We then start building the boiler and cabin.

3	Going up fast and steady!

3	In the penultimate step, we build the chimney and cow catcher.

3	Iâ€™d like to spend a few more words on the chimney and how it is attached to the main body.

3	As you can see in the left picture, the 3x3 base of the chimney is asymmetrical, with a 3x2 base on one side and a combination of a 1x2 and a 1x1 plates on the other.

3	In the right picture, you see the top of the main body where the chimney will be attached; it is made of a 1x2 base and 1 1x2 tile.

3	Using another â€˜illegalâ€™ technique (or at least one LEGO designers do not like much nowadays), the holes of the 3x2 plate of the chimney will connect with the studs of the 1x2 plate on the main body, giving a well centred and quite sturdy build.

3	Finished set Front The front of the model sports 3 big headlights, a nice cow catcher and the nicely detailed engine front.

3	I can almost hear it whistle!

3	Side And here it is our good old Thatcher Perkins Locomotive!

3	Indeed, it looks like a classic and powerful engine form one of those Spaghetti Western films, doesnâ€™t it?

3	What I found strange in the beginning is the choice of colours (I was convinced steam engines were all black, at the time).

3	Then I checked some pictures of the original, and I must admit the resemblance is almost perfect!

3	Back The back side is less detailed than the front, with cabin almost devoid of details.

3	I think LEGO could have done a better job on it.

3	3/4 Front and â€¦ Just see how good it looks from this angle, with all the tubing, moving parts and the lovely 3 headlights!

3	â€¦ 3/4 Back The back view is not as impressive, but grants us a good look at the big posterior wheels and the bumpers.

3	Bonus images Size comparison?

3	As I stated elsewhere, I never understood what scale these Hobby Sets are meant to be.

3	They are clearly not minifig-scale, and they are not technic-fig-scale either.

3	But they are not even Miniland scale!

3	Moreover, they use different scales between locomotives, cars and motorbikes amongst the Hobby Set line!

3	As I said before, the set comes with tyres on the wheels to allow a wider playing experience, not limiting this model to tracks.

3	Nonetheless, builders can assemble their own track (maybe using the vintage blue 4.5V tracks) and make the Thatcher Perkins run its proper environment.

3	Final comments Overall, this is a great set for collectors of old models and steam engines fans, or both.

3	It does not sport a huge variety of bricks, but was a good choice at the time, and even if the result is matter-of-fact a bit blocky when compared to the original, it implements some good solutions to minimise the LEGO brick appearance and maximise the similarity as much as possible.

3	Design & Colour scheme â€“ 8/10 (The design is as accurate as possible, and the colours are completely in line for the Thatcher Perkins Locomotive.

3	The solutions and details included in this set justify the â€˜Expert buildersâ€™ label and add to the appearance, and, why not, playability of the model.

3	Though, I still wish TLG had included more details in the cabin.)

3	Parts - 10/10 (Quite a big selection, but only one new mould.

3	Nonetheless, a good source of Black, Blue and Red standard parts for MOCs and one of the few sources for the extra rare Black Plate, Modified 1 x 2 with Steam Engine Cylinder, Flat Surfaces, Black Train Wheel Spoked for Motor, Red Train Steam Drive Rod Holder - Train Steam Drive Rod group and Wheel Spoked Large.)

3	Playability - 9/10 (A sturdy model which can take some serious play and swoosh-ing without falling apart.

3	The somewhat easily detachable chimney and the lack of an appropriate scale interaction with most other models make it lose one point, though.)

3	Build - 7/10 (Pretty straight forward, with few nice solutions.)

3	Price - 5/10 (Like most older models, especially the Hobby Set and Model Team ones, this set can only rarely be found at reasonable prices.

3	Most of the times, people are asked shameful prices for such a smallish set.)

3	Overall: 8/10 Very good.

3	More pictures can be found in this Brickshelf gallery.

3	Rare classic sets are always a priceless part of any LEGO collection, and it's a good thing you still have this first set of yours Luxor (or did you purchase a new one?).

3	Excellent review BTW, it's always a pleasure getting a closer look at these classic sets which I wouldn't have known to exist had I not seen this review.

3	Overall I think it's a really good set at that time, of course judging this one by modern standards won't be fair but at the time I'm pretty sure it was a 'cool' set to have (though less cooler than having the Harley Davidson set).

3	Thanks for the review 'LuxorV', an interesting old set, though I find it hard to imagine a square smoke stack instead of roundish.

3	It truly has that classic Lego simplistic build with all studs showing and making do with standard partsm except the few you havepointed out 'LuxorV'.

3	A nice flashback 35 years ago....now thats old school anyway Brick On everyone !

3	Thanks, Luxor, for bringing us this excellent tour round an old classic!

3	For its time, this is truly a remarkably detailed and beautiful set, and I think it's amazing how it's still in such good condition after all this time.

3	Do you have any more from this era (excepting the Harley, of course )?

3	I've created a whole new index to put them in

3	INDEXED 410 â€“ Payloader Theme: Legoland/Vehicle Piece Count: 28 Year Released: 1973 MSRP: ???

3	Links: Brickset, Lugnet, Peeron, Bricklink *Note: This set was released under the number 604 outside of the U.S.* Ah, classic Legoland.

3	A time before mini-figs ever existed, and cars and buildings could be made with just a few bricks.

3	The part selection was pretty basic: bricks, plates, slopes, windows and wheels were all you needed to construct an entire town.

3	Heavy machinery could be modeled in 4-wide and be just a few bricks tall.

3	For this review we will be taking a look at the 410 Payloader, one of LEGOâ€™s first sets of a bucket loader.

3	So grab a hard hat, we are heading to the construction yard!

3	Box image courtesy of Bricklink.

3	Box Contents Here we have our instructions which are obviously the older style of LEGO instructions.

3	The steps used much simpler imagery, but they get the job done.

3	They show how to build the Payloader in seven steps.

3	This small set has all of 28 parts in it.

3	The more interesting parts of note are the red digger arm, the bucket, the blue 1X2 brick with arm holes, and the blue 2X2 brick with the classic LEGO logo printed on it.

3	Construction In the first few steps we start building up the base.

3	Then add the arms and start building the cab.

3	Add the bucket, the trailer socket and finish the cab.

3	Throw on some wheels.

3	Completed Set And with that we are finished with our nice small model.

3	Here is the back right side.

3	Notice how the back of the cab was left with an empty spot.

3	Here is the left side.

3	Notice how on the top of the arm they made it so you could just push down on the tips it to make the arm lift instead of having to grab by the arm itself.

3	On the front we have the nice LEGO logo shown to remind the forgetful of what they were playing with.

3	You can also see how much space is in the bucket itself, which can't hold more than a few small plates.

3	Finally on the back we have the trailer socket.

3	This was a nice addition to make it able to tow trailers from other sets like 685.

3	Just donâ€™t try to bring it into your layout populated by mini-figs, they may have a problem trying to get in.

3	Other Thoughts Considering this set is nearly 37 years old, I myself am still surprised by how well the bricks have held up.

3	I purchased this set from a thrift store a year ago for a mere 25 cents.

3	Normally when used LEGO is purchased you can expect to see scratches, marks, wearing, discoloration, etc but boy was I surprised to see how all these parts are in mint condition.

3	Even the instructions still looked like they came from a new box and not all ripped up and tattered.

3	The pieces still connect to each other nice and tight and the metal pieces for the wheels haven't rusted.

3	This just shows that with proper care these things can last a lifetime.

3	I really would like to get a small display case to show it off.

3	Conclusion Playability: 8/10 In addition to the standard of having rolling wheels, you also get a fully movable bucket assembly.

3	With it you can pick up smaller pieces and unload them into a dump truck.

3	Design: 7/10 Like all other Legoland vehicles it has a very basic design, but you can still easily identify what it is.

3	Simple yet effective.

3	Parts: 7/10 Like most other older LEGO sets, all you really get are a few basic bricks and plates.

3	However, you do get a bucket assembly and the 2X2 brick with the classic LEGO logo on it is very cool.

3	It was also nice of LEGO to include the trailer socket so you could tow around your trailers.

3	Price: 8/10 Bricklink's history shows them to sell for around $10 USD used.

3	While that is a bit much for a set this size, it is pretty good considering this set is over 37 years old.

3	However, if you are looking for a new boxed set be prepared to fork over about $50 USD.

3	Overall: 8/10 This small machine would make a nice addition to your collection as a reminder of LEGO's past.

3	So what are your thoughts on this classic set?

3	Edited by TheBrickster, 01 June 2010 - 05:55 AM.

3	Thank you very much for this wonderful review!

3	This is the oldest Lego set in my collection.

3	I received this model from my grand parents many years ago - I'm not exactly sure who in my family it used to belong to, but it has a home with me now.

3	It's a very simple but attractive looking vehicle, and functions pretty well too.

3	Overall, very nice.

3	Thanks for the great nostalgic review!

3	Great pictures, I love the shiny glow of 37 year old bricks!

3	Sets were simpler back then, but not less exciting in their own way.

3	I wasn't even born in 1973, but one of my first sets was the 1982 update of this, 6630 Bucket Loader.

3	Almost 10 years later, but the very same bucket assembly, only the colours have changed.

3	Nice review!

3	Great nostalgic set, like you said, it has nice design-Simple yet effective!

3	I like construction vehicles, so this set has even bigger impact on me!

3	Ah, the good old days........Thanks for the review 'Yoshi648' - CUTE and COOL at the same time.

3	It's interesting to see that the same front end parts had been used from the early 70's up in to the late 90's !

3	Nice again to step back in time and keep on bricking everyone !

3	I voted 'Outstanding.'

3	Regarding this set, I found mine at a consignment store.

3	It was inside of a larger set from the same time period.

2	Woah.

2	25 cents for a mint condition set!

2	That's amazing.

2	Well, it's not exactly a large shuttle, but still a nice set: 442 Space Shuttle Year Released: 1979 Piece Count: 79 Minifigs: 1 Vehicles: 0 List Price: unknown This little classic was my smallest classic space set.

2	Believe it or not, I still have the box: Here's the back: The instructions are pretty tattered and missing a section.

2	I had to download some from the web: But the ship is again intact, missing only one grey 1x3 plate: I've always liked this computer piece: Here's the under side.

2	This set included the small classic jet engines: A close-up of the sloped printed space brick: And the complete set with minifig: This set was a great little space ship that made a nice addition to the Blue Space Theme.

2	As small as it was, it could hold two-three figs (one standing up).

2	I don't even think the Mars Mission Recon Drop Ship holds three figs.

2	In any case, it was a must-have for Blue Space Fans, and probably only a few bucks back in the day.

2	SWOOSH!

3	It's simply amazing how far Lego has come in 30 years.

3	and again those tears in my eyes.

3	with original box...!

3	I really love those classic space stuff.

3	Looks like I need to clean my stuff this summer.

3	This classic space shuttle is simply superb!

3	I love the layout of this shuttle.

3	In fact, it reminded me as one of the space fighter jet, that roam around in space, defending the boundaries from intruders.

3	I just love these old grey bricks very much and the printed computer brick is just lovely.

3	It's such a pity, that I did not grow up with Classic Space in my childhood.

3	These are actually great stuff, and formed the base of the Space theme in LEGO.

3	Brickster, thanks again for another outstanding classic review.

3	this was my first space set ever!!

3	1979, 1980... don't know anymore, but i do remember i got this together with 897 for my birthday when we where camping... with a little luck i may even have an old film from my dad, opening the boxes... well what to say... it looked soooooo aggressive with those two engines!

3	but i never knew why you needed two steering wheels on it... they probably just thought a symmetrical model was better .... i can't blame them... what a nice set.... it would even sell today, no doubt... looooots of swooshability...

3	The computer is my favorite part.

3	Sadly, I dont own any classic space...Exept for some space police, and a blue classic space man.

3	Nice!!!

3	442 is the lowest set number I have seen for any Classic Space set, so it must been released with the first wave in 1978.

3	Its remarkable that a LEGO spaceship this old and small can seat more figs than the much bigger MX-71 Recon Dropship of today.

3	Anyway, I just want to grab it out of the screen and swoosh it all over the place, lol.

3	TLG, please make these Classic Space sets again!

3	I promise I'll buy many!

2	INDEXED Everyone remembers their first time.

2	For me, it was in 19*cough*somethingsomething*cough*.

2	We were at her house, and her mother was gone for at least an hour.

2	She slowly unzi... uhhh.

2	Sorry, wrong story.

2	Um, yeahh.

2	Anyway, I do remember my first time.

2	It was 1977, in late summer.

2	Our neighbor, who worked for a department store called Famous-Bahr, said that the main store had a travelling LEGO display.

2	So my family filed into the car and drove into downtown St Louis to see this display.

2	To tell you the truth, I don't remember much about the display itself, but I DO remember that my parents bought me my first LEGO set.

2	Set # 456, the Spirit of St Louis.

2	Set #: 456 (also sold as Set # 661) Name: Spirit of St Louis Theme: LEGOLAND / Large Vehicle Year: 1977 Pieces: 49 Minifigs: 0 Price: $5.00 USD?

2	(Bricklink MISB start @ $175.00 USD, Used Complete ~$35.00 USD) Links: Peeron, Bricklink, Brickset Packaging Box Front: The original box that my set came in was most likely trashed 5 minutes after returning home.

2	This image was lovingly stolen off of the Peeron page for this set.

2	I feel lucky that I even got this much.

2	Similarly, I have no pictures of the plastic baggies the set came in.

2	Truth be told, I can't be sure that there even WERE plastic baggies that the parts came in.

2	THE SET Side View: Well there she is.

2	My first set ever .

2	Actually, I seem to recall the real Spirit of St Louis was silver colored, not Black and Yellow.

2	If you need a history lesson, the Spirit of St Louis was Charles Lindbergh's plane when he made the first trans-Atlantic solo flight.

2	More details can be found on the Wikipedia page.

2	The overall shape is pretty close, at least.

2	The cockpit window could stand to be moved forward one stud, but everything seems to be relatively close.

2	The tail piece isn't the right shape, but it is likely the only tail piece LEGO produced at the time.

2	If you look closely, you can see the various bite marks that my brother and I inflicted over the years.

2	I know some people would be aghast that there are bite marks, but brick separators wouldn't come out for another 10 years.

2	Besides, we were young.

2	We didn't know any better.

2	I certainly had no idea that it would become my obsession.

2	There are some interesting part choices here.

2	Everything is brick and plate built, as you might expect.

2	The same set nowadays would have lots of slope, wedges and wedge plates to round things out.

2	But LEGO was all about the brick in '77, so bricks are what we got.

2	The black inverted slopes worked pretty well asthetically as the wing struts.

2	The wings are simple 4 x 10 plates, nice and square.

2	There were no minifigs in this set.

2	If I remember correctly, 1977 was just about the time when minifigs made their first appearance.

2	I know I have one other set from '77 that does include a minifg, at least.

2	I don't have a lot of comments for the following photos.

2	I'll let the pictures speak for themselves.

2	3/4 View Back Back 3/4 Top Front PARTS Interesting Pieces I have no idea if there were any extra pieces that came with this set.

2	I kind of doubt it.

2	Instead I took a photo of some of the interesting parts to the model.

2	That translucent white piece didn't photograph so well, but it is a Technic Axle 8.

2	That's right, sets from 1977 contained Technic elements.

2	The two black parts are the forerunners to the 1 x 2 Technic Brick, as well.

2	Everytime I hear someone on the forums complain about Technic elements in system sets, I think back to this set.

2	The round brick is special as well.

2	Here is a closer view of it, complete with bite marks .

2	Round Brick As you can see, the stud is closed.

2	It is only one of two closed stud 1 x 1 Round Bricks that I own.

2	They stopped appearing in sets in 1981, for those that are interested.

2	The DSS You thought you were going to escape this heading, didn't you?

2	Surprise!

2	Yes, even in 1977 LEGO sets had stickers.

2	The oldest printed elements I can remember were in the Classic Space sets that started in 1979.

2	Again, when people in the forums complain about DSS in sets, I can only help think of this set.

2	And chuckle to myself maniacally.

2	The sticker has held up really well considering it's been stuck on the brick for 32 years.

2	No discoloration, very little curling.

2	I think if all stickers held up this well over time, there would be less DSS complaints.

2	THE RATINGS Playability: 6/10 - The set is quite swooshable, and the propellor spins.

2	Outside of that, though... Minifigs: N/A Design: 6/10 - The overall shape is quite good, especially given the era.

2	The color choice leaves a lot to be desired.

2	Price: 1/10 - It's been retired for 30 years.

2	It's going to cost you to get your hands on it.

2	Overall: 13/30 - This set is for true collectors only.

2	I can't imagine anyone wanting one because they want to play with it.

2	It was a great set back in the day, but the design feels REALLY dated.

2	And if you're wondering, mine is NOT for sale.

2	Ever.

2	All the photos, plus more, can be found in the Gallery.

3	Very brave to give an impression about one of the oldest sets ever reviewed!

3	A lot members here are younger than the set itself.

3	I think you will have to have grown up with it to like it.

3	Nowadays we have seen quite a few better airplanes than that one, for example this years 7643 .

3	But thanks for letting us know.

3	Btw., the 1x1 round brick with the solid stud is no.

3	3062a instead of 3062b (with the hollow stud).

3	Great job!

3	I love reading vintage reviews, as it reminds of our childhood days.

3	Glad to see this in very good condition.

3	By the way, I will move this to LEGO Trains & Town, to see if TheBrickster will like to include this set inside the review index over there.

3	I believe he is maintaining vintage town set reviews over there, and this suits there well.

2	I'm sorry you had to move this topic, White Fang.

2	When it was in the Reviewers Academy, the teachers agreed it belonged in Other Themes.

2	*shrug* I guess it ended up where it belonged eventually.

2	Great review, It's good to see some of the old sets reviewed.

2	I think I learned something about the history of Lego from this one.

2	fantastic review!

2	IÂ´d love to read more like this, trivia about old/rare pieces is almost as fun as the set itself.

3	Outstanding review of a very special set!

3	I actually remember seeing this set on the store shelves of local department stores.

3	Can you believe it?

3	Fantastic review Walter.

3	I really enjoy looking at these vintage sets.

3	This one deserves a BLOG!

1	In 1977, trans or yellow slopes existed already, and using them would have made the plane more realistic.

1	A third rear wheel would have enhanced playability and design, rather than this ugly black round brick.

1	It's the reason why I voted "below average" even considering 1977's standards.

1	However this set is nice and simple, offering good playability.

3	Here is the Spirit of St Louis.

3	Just go there (Washington) and have a look of this legend : Cavannus, on Jul 15 2009, 09:40 PM, said: In 1977, trans or yellow slopes existed already, and using them would have made the plane more realistic.

3	I don't think so.

3	There is no 45Â° slope in the original plane design ... and no front cockpit window.

3	Quote A third rear wheel would have enhanced playability and design, rather than this ugly black round brick.

3	Except that it wouldn't have been the Spirit Of St Louis.

3	This set is a great one and I wish I'd bought it in '77.

3	It is the Spirit of the 70ties ...

1	daoudbazaar, on Jul 15 2009, 05:26 PM, said: [...] There is no 45Â° slope in the original plane design ... and no front cockpit window.

1	[...] Except that it wouldn't have been the Spirit Of St Louis.

1	Oooops, you're completely right, the Spirit Of St-Louis didn't have any front window nor rear wheel.

1	Anyway, I think a standard Ryan M-1/M-2 plane would have been a better choice.

1	Less a legend, but more a flexible plan for multiple uses!

3	I really like the design, it has an aesthetic value lacking from most official Lego planes and follows closely to the real thing (minus the colours), something that can't really be claimed for more recent sets.

3	483 Alpha-1 Rocket Base Year Released: 1979 Piece Count: 170 Minifigs: 3 Vehicles: 1 (two sections) List Price: unknown Despite the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1968, Lego dared design a Rocket Base complete with a rocket system that may have had nuclear capability in 1979.

3	Luckily, the rocket was defective having rather flimsy white bricks that did not stay together well during launch attempts.

3	Lego scrapped its WMD program and the result was this classic "blue era" space set known as the Alpha-1 Rocket Base.

3	Instructions: On the backside of the instructions, the set is featured with the Space Command Center, Space Cruiser, and a few vehicle sets: The set includes three figs: And this great rocket fuel tanker: Here's the front section complete with computer: And the rocket fuel section: The set has some interesting features including the Control Section, Fuel Control, and Launch Pad: On top of the Control Section is a nicely design radar/tracking system: Here's the open control room: The Launch Pad and Fuel Control: The Fuel Control includes two sink pieces and blue steering wheels: And Lego's WMD (Weapon of Mass Destruction), the Alpha-1 on the Launch Pad: Here's a shot of the launching mechanism: Unfortunately, I have lost one of the blue sink/faucet pieces as well as a black hose: A close-up of the Alpha-1 Rocket.

3	The white bricks never stayed together well often times coming apart within your hands: The arming and guidance system was nicely designed: A view of the complete set: And another: This is a great set.

3	The base, fuel vehicle, and launch platform offers a great amount of playability.

3	My only complaint is the rocket (as mentioned above).

3	I don't think I ever played with it a sa kid because it always fell apart.

3	Share your comments regarding this Classic Space set.

2	The white bricks never stayed together well often times coming apart within your hands: Huh, did they not think of putting a technic axle down the center of the rocket?

2	Come to think of it, when were technic axles invented.... Its a neat little set, makes me think I oughta make some similar kinda layout in LDD, very elegant for playability.

2	I always thought that that grey thing on top of the rocket was some kind of satelite... xenologer, on Jul 4 2008, 05:25 AM, said: Huh, did they not think of putting a technic axle down the center of the rocket?

2	Come to think of it, when were technic axles invented....

2	I had this set as a kid and I don't think there was a technic axle inside that rocket, but if I remember correctly some of the later CS rockets did.

3	I'm loving that trans-yellow plate on top of the roof.

3	Great review!

3	wooow!

3	what a set!!

3	not all that large, most defenitely not as sophisticated as the message intercept base from 10 years later, but in those, this was all a kid need to have hours of fun.

3	soooo many great parts on this one.... technic hoses, computers, rocket parts, trans yellow parts... the perfect outpst really... it was actually my sister who got this one, but it only took an hour before i claimed it... Edited by snefroe, 14 July 2008 - 12:36 PM.

3	Oh did I drool over this set as a kid!

3	Since I never got it I didn't know how bad the rocket really was... Great review.

3	xenologer, on Jul 4 2008, 12:25 PM, said: Come to think of it, when were technic axles invented....

3	The white ones were.

3	Ahh, the good old days.

3	Thanks for the review.

3	Nice rewiew The set is good too)

3	Hey EB'ers, i got my Market Street on Monday and finished building it last night.

3	I know it?s not such a nice review like *yoda* did the last times, but i hope you enjoy some of the pics.

3	First a pic of the complete building: The 3 Minifigs: and i pic of the stairs (one of my highlights at this set): More pics you can find here My opinion about the set: I like this set very much, it was really fun to build it.

3	I?m happy that that i got some more cherries and a croissant now *sweet* , a funny idea is the salad in the one box at the front.

3	i think normally it?s a hairpiece of an exoforce fig.

3	I also like the colours of the house, the dark blue is sooooo nice.

3	I think i have to take more of this soon.

3	The lighter blue is also nice.

3	This set has really nice details like the stairs, or the owl at the entry of the market, or the balcony.

3	I paid 89,99 EUR, a fair price for a really nice set!!

3	Greetings Sandra

3	Thanks for the review, my favourite detail is the salad!

3	:-D BTW, could you exchange the modules and make pics of that?

3	I'd like to see how the building looks with the flat roof instead of the dutch style one.

3	I'm not sure though if the vents on the flat roof makes sense as long as it's only used as a garage top... :-/ Maybe they should be removable as the balconies and such things to make the modularity leading not to weird results... Other than this: In combination with a lot of money and the Cafe Corner set this really could get me into city!

3	;-)

1	thanks for the great review!

1	*sweet* now that i've seen the set, I'm afraid i'm a bit disappointed 8-| 1) the color combination doesn't really do it for me.

1	blue, dark blue, grey, black, tan, white, they're all mixed together without any over all design... 2) is there any interior?

1	it doesn't look like it, and in any case, you can only reach it if you remove the modules... hm... |-/ now it looks too much of a box... 3) there are most certainly some nice ideas in this model and some great parts.

1	the best part of the model is the staircase 4) i don't think he spent much time in thinking about the design.

1	As apo said, the chimneys on top of a garage is kinda weird, there's also a gate, next to another gate which is weird as well... also, if this is supposed to ba a grocery, then the owner has done a lot to hide it.

1	The croissant is nice, but next to the brown box with vegies, there's nothing that suggests this is a shop... 5) the white lamp and the the yellow cylinder are at the same level of the tiles.

1	IMO it should be above the level of the tiles... 6), IMO not worth the 90 euro Edited by snefroe1, 20 June 2007 - 09:03 AM.

3	Thanks, I love the look of this set!

3	I love the mix of colours, it breaks up the model rather than being a single monotone colour.

3	He's used several complimentary colours in order to make up the model.

3	I agree I think the chimneys on the flat roof is weird ontop of the garage, but not so weird one you place it ontop of the building.

3	I guess he's done it to give us the choice of roofs and chimneys.

3	You can always remove the ones you don't like...

3	He also seems to have screwed up a bit on the tiling for the sidewalk on the side module.

3	On Cafe Corner (And the building module of this set) the sidewalk has the pattern light grey 1x6 at the front, then dark grey 1x2 next, then dark grey 2x2's.

3	However on this he's put the 2x2 tiles first then the 1x2's at the back.

3	Easilly fixable though.

3	Overall I love this set, thanks for the pics!

3	Compliments Cafe Corner perfectly.

3	Thank you Legocastlegirls for your quick review!

3	*y* It?s the first time I realize the back of the market street.

3	The tan bricks are a replacement for some windows I?d guess?

3	I do love that building, especially the top floor with the neat balcony.

3	*wub* Of course you are (again) left alone filling the interior.

3	But I just had some food parts ordered at Bricklink... X-D One thing I?d like to know: This is an online-exclusive, right?

3	Can I order it at a Lego-store (K?ln / Oberhausen) and get the sum rewarded on my voucher booklet?

3	*sweet* I heard it here, but I?m not sure.

3	8-| If anyone is looking for how to fill it with interior: Go read the latest Brickjournal #8!

3	There?s a whole chapter written about designing the rooms.

3	Interior On!

3	Hi Thanks for posting those great pictures.

3	I got the CC some time ago and I really looking forward to get my hands on the Market Street.

3	I think the colour scheme of this set is great, maybe because blue is my favourite colour (just check my wardrobe)?

3	I really like the design of the roof and the staircase.

3	I ?am not so sure if I like the gateways but I believe they will grow on me when I get the set myself snefroe1, on Jun 20 2007, 09:02 AM, said: 5) the white lamp and the the yellow cylinder are at the same level of the tiles.

3	IMO it should be above the level of the tiles...

3	I?

3	am totally agree with snefreo1, the yellow cylinder and the lamppost should be on a level above the tiles.

3	Actually I have put a 2x2 plat under the lamppost on my CC, looks much better if you ask me.

3	Unfortunately Shop at Home does not send to Norway??

3	?, so I have to purchase this set in Billund (Yes, I ?am going to Legoland this summer) or on ebay.

2	but you have to bring the bill with you.

2	i?ve never seen holes at the footpath for some lamps.

2	It is really dangerous for all the nice little minifigs :-) Greetings Sandra

1	thanks for the pics Legocastlegirl!

1	One thing that I find strange is that TLC doesn't use a female MF head for those two females MF in this set, but a female MF head is available in LDD and pab *wacko*

3	I still haven't bought the CC or MS.

3	But reviews like this make me wanna buy them instantly.

3	Thanks for this Legocastlegirl !

3	!

3	Thank you very much for that nice review and those lovely pictures, Legocastlegirl!

3	*y* A very interesting set with a great color scheme and some "sunny side" feeling indeed.

3	*sweet*

3	I'm not much of a city fan but this looks great.

3	I guess this is the closest we can get to Legoland (miniland) quality sets.

3	And considering this is a three floro, small structure, and it's over 1,000 parts, just imagine (pun not intended) how many peices are in LL California's Empire State Building or WTC Freedom Tower models!

3	Both are large and in real scale over 100 floors!

3	That's a lot of bricks.

3	Anyways, I've got a friend who loves city.

3	I'm sure this one would make a great addition to his town setup!

3	Gotta tell him about this new set!

3	*y*

3	Nonsense Sandra !!

3	Tks for sharing these cool pics ;-) Its also a nice hommage to Erik Brok.

3	I really like this set, I think its really well designed with great ideas such as the dual stairs, the balconies, the croissant insignia, the market entrance design with the horns, whip and owl 8-?

3	I like the color combination, and the mosaic design just in front of the entrance.

3	The only terrible flaw is that yellow cinlinder !!

3	That is just awful for a flower pot :-X I don't mind at all having that lamp post at the same level since it would be normal to have the base of the lamp at the level of the tile but I agree that is just pickering about an insignificant detail :-P Legocastlegirl, on Jun 20 2007, 07:42 AM, said: a funny idea is the salad in the one box at the front.

3	i think normally it?s a hairpiece of an exoforce fig.

3	Yeay that is just brilliant all the way 8-?

3	This is a great set indeed and a must have for town fans !!

3	When rich people became poor, they placed bricks in their window, so they paid less taxes.

3	Some older houses still has walls were once were windows.

3	:'-)

3	You're the coolest man I know!

3	Thanks for sharing copmike.

3	That thing is awesome.

2	Thank you, interesting indeed.

2	Those are quite expensive though, perhaps 60 dollars or more.

3	Very nice *wub* How'd you get a hold of it?

3	Wow, that's awesome!

3	Here?s the text from the back of the box: Quote For much of the Galactic Civil War, a mysterious agent of Palpatine code-named Blackhole carefully sifted through countless streams of data, distilling it into useful information for Imperial Intelligence.

3	Blackhole had an impressive amount of resourses available to him, including a entire Star Destroyer and its complement of troops and fighters.

3	Per his orders, the stormtroopers under his command had their armor cast in black to match his own particular eccentricities.

3	The armor modification had practical benefits as well.

3	The stygian-triprismatic polymer afforded the stormtroopers increased sensor-stealth.

3	*wub* - pure poetry X-D!

3	Very nice copmike!!

3	I can't wait to get my boba now!

3	Those ebay prices aren't to bad.

3	Hmmmm... :-D

3	Thats so cool!

3	i would want one.

3	It would look good in the house.

2	So, were you serious about any of the Boba Fett, Luke Skywalker, Stormtrooper & Darth Vader ones?

2	Because I'd love to see a Boba Fett and Vader one.

2	Luke is coming out in the 6212 X-Wing bonus pack: And Boba Fett was up for preorder over at Starwars.com shop before it also sold out: Maquettes On copmike

3	Wow, if the tru 6212 is to be believed, the Luke marque costs $50.

3	but that looks so cool.

3	Definitely a keeper.

1	The lightsabers are strangely skinny.

1	Do they light up or something?

1	Or was the transparent plastic too expensive to make thick blades?

1	:-/ :-P

3	Hi, you are right, this is such a fantastic maquette.

3	I really hope that I will get the chance to own the other 4, too.

3	It is carefully packed in styropor.

3	The painting is nice, looks really evil.

3	I think it is a wonderful addition (with the 4 other) to any collector shelf..(-; Mine is number 276. greetings Hendrik

2	I have #70 (and #8 :-$ ).

3	Damn you for making me want these now!

3	Seriously, these look amazing and would look great on any bookshelf.

3	Wow thats so cool mutley.

3	My favourites are Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker because the others seem to have funny looking heads.

3	Not so much Boba Fett but the storm trooper and the blackhole stormtrooper do.

3	It must be their helmets.

3	Maybe one day I get one of these, too.

3	I always wanted one of these (*Sighs*) I don't think that I'll ever get it though.

3	You did it - I´m so glad !

3	I hope it didn´t cost you $1230 which is the cheapest right now for all five on BL !

3	But still cheap compared to this one!!!

3	Well, here are mine: I´ll hang on the my extra Blackhole Stormie a while more !

3	If Morten doesn´t come here and break it that is !

3	Well, now that I have some money, a trip to ToysRUs was obviously in my future, especially since my local TRU has much of the summer 2007 lineup.

3	When I got there, almost all the smaller Castle sets had been sold out, but there was one left: the one I am now reviewing for both Eurobricks and BZPower.

3	;-) The Box: Well, for starters, the Castle theme boxes are beautiful!

3	The blended clear and stormy skies give a great ?clash of the titans?

3	effect, and the action poses help as well.

3	;-) The back is equally nice, featuring a photo showing kids how to use the crossbow, and the brave axe wielder taking a swipe at the skeleton (foolish soldier, that won?t work on skellies!

3	See later on in the review to find out why).

3	And of course, we have a small box with the link to the official Lego website, where TLC can advertise even more Lego sets!

3	:P The Contents: After opening the box, a single bag of pieces (with a couple loose ones), the instruction manual and necessary catalog ( :-P ), and a new wider rubber band holder spilt out.

3	The instruction manual is clear as a bell.

3	No color trouble here, folks!

3	Also, it?s worth mentioning the nice background with the mountain and King?s castle silhouettes.

3	:-) Sorry that there's no picture, but I'll take one if someone wants to see it.

3	;-) The Pieces: For being a 5 dollar set (well, seven in my case.

3	Darn your above average prices, TRU!

3	), Crossbow Attack features a lot of nice pieces (as does the entire Castle lineup).

3	Notable elements include two large brown spoked wheels, two brown modified 1x1?s, a pearl gold slope end, and SIX dark blue modified 1x1x2/3 slopes!

3	The bulk of the pieces, however, are nothing special.

3	I?ll let the picture do the talking for this.

3	The accessories are by far the best parts in this kit.

3	Two different helmets in a beautiful shiny silver are my favorite, but I also really like the scythe (looks good for MOCing) and the round shield ( *wub* ), which are both brand new parts.

3	And can anyone not love the classic axe and crossbows?

3	Oh, and there?s a black lightsaber too, but that?s rather boring compared to the other parts.

3	:-P The Minifigures: Can you say, FOUR figures (including the horse)?!

3	That has to be a record for a regular 5 dollar set, at least in the present age of limited figures per set.

3	We?ll start out with the two Crown militia: a regular soldier and an archer.

3	Both have old faces, but they look spiffy with the shiny helmets and the superb torsos.

3	I?ll name the soldier Bravo the Stout and the archer Angler the Precise, for future references.

3	Now we come to the skellie.

3	Although some people dislike the new skeleton design, I personally prefer it to the old ones, since the arms are now poseable and the face much meaner.

3	The only problem is that the arms hang too low, but it?s not too noticeable when they have weapons in their hands.

3	And last, but not least, here?s the elusive skeleton horse.

3	I for one am very happy that TLC took advantage of that awesome prototype piece and made it into an official mass-production mold.

3	However, the horse is unfortunately one piece, but since regular Lego horses are as well, I don?t have a problem with it.

3	I do have a problem with the pose, however.

3	The legs are in quite an odd position, and I wonder why TLC didn?t make the front and back leg poses symmetrical.

3	Ah well.

3	The Finished Set: I have only two pictures here, since this set is so small.

3	First, here?s the completed crossbow.

3	I must say: FINALLY!

3	No more ridiculous horse mounted catapults or crazy fire wheel launchers!

3	Now we have realistic siege weapons, including the one included with 7090.

3	Plus, it actually launches okay, although not the best.

3	Here?s the other main attraction: the completed skeleton rider and horse.

3	I think it?s rather dramatic with that pose and the dark background, don?t you think?

3	;-) Playability: Okay, so there?s not much in this set, but a bit of imagination brings plenty of possibilities.

3	To show you what you can do, here?s a little story made only with this set.

3	;-) Overall Rating: Presentation: 9/10 Pieces: 8/10 Minifigures: 9/10 Finished model: 8/10 Playability: 8/10 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Final Score: 8.4/10 Crossbow Attack is a fine introduction into Castle, so I recommend it to any Lego fan, whether they are a castle nut or just want a cheap change of pace.

3	TLC has a knack with making great small kits these days, and I more than ever support them in their amazing rebound from their dark ages (between 1997 and 2004).

3	;-) Edited by KimT, 10 August 2008 - 01:33 PM.

1	Thanks for this review, and that great little comic!

1	About the skellies though (X-D), you have to admit that besides their long arms making the skellie legs look out of proportion, that they're just made poorly.

1	They're sticking straight out, as opposed to every other fig, which have a slight bend to make them look more natural.

1	Also, as I'm sure you've noticed, the pegs are on angles!

1	That makes it impossible for them to hold their weapons straight, and they can't even put their arms over their heads without stressing the plastic some...

1	I mean they're DEAD.

1	Well, at least undead, they're not supposed to be stiff, and personally I like the ragdoll look more, it makes them seem more dead :-P

3	A very nice review with good pictures, thanks Grevious.

3	*y* And undead ragdolls on!

3	:-P

3	WOW!

3	That was both an entertaining time, and a learning experience!

3	It was entertaining because the comic made me laugh!

3	It was a learning experience because, well, I dunno.

3	Just wanted to say it.

3	Anyways, great review, Grievous!

3	Edited by trooperdavinfelth, 01 July 2007 - 09:46 PM.

3	Very nice little review.

3	Tis too bad I'm skint and can't afford any sets at the moment.

3	Loved the little story too!

3	Also, on your comment about the skellie horses.

3	All Lego horses are posed like that because it's the way horses walk.

3	Check it next time you can.

3	Thanks for the review.

3	That set is high up on my list; how could it not be with a price like that!

3	(I love the added story.)

3	Excellent photographs!

3	and I like the comic too.

3	I don't care what anyone says, I love the new skeletons.

3	*skull*

3	Nice review, and great little story.

3	:-D *y* Look at the normal horses, their legs are positioned like that too.

3	Only the skellie horse's legs are touching, so as to strengthen the middle, otherwise it could easily snap in half.

3	Also, I think the new skeletons are nice, their head is awesome, I just don't see why TLC couldn't make the bent droid arms with the hand facing vertically, instead of making a new arm design completely straight.

3	Nice review and a great story also grevious, this is a great set and a nice little army builder one at that.

3	The only thing that saddens me about the line itself is the new arms on the skelies, they just look far to big when placed next to a normal fig.

3	For me the old versions of the skelies were far better, why tlc changed to this is beyond me.

3	Still i shall be buying alot of these sets just to increase my army.

3	Tks a lot Grevious for this !!

3	Regarding the set I just love it !!

3	I really oved your comic, it was really well done and hilarious X-D EB Spirit ON !!

2	Thanks for all the comments, guys, and thank you, JoeM16 and iamded for pointing out the reason for the skeleton horse leg positioning.

2	;-) Well, I'll be gone on vacation until the 16, but I may pick up a set or two while down in Tenessee, so if I do, expect a review and another story when I get back!

2	;-)

3	This is the only one of the new castle sets I've been able to get hold of so far.

3	I know others have done it before, but as soon as I'd got it, there was something I just had to try: Heh, cool!

3	*skull*

3	Grim Reaper ON!

3	The new skellie looks so much more natural with the droid arm *y* !

3	Great review, i love this set.

3	Great review *y* Small set with great figs and pieces=must buy The story was hilarious :-) Any chance you are going to review another set?

3	I'm still waiting for a certain member *cough*Hinckley*cough* to review skeleton tower :-D Piranha

3	Good review.

2	I've searched high and low accross England to find this...and it's nowhere!

2	I'm too stingy to buy off S@H and so I'll wait my turn.

2	OK, now ot the set: Let's say I buy 3, for ?12.

2	That's 6 soldiers, 3 skellies and 3 horses.

2	Considering each fig is worth ?1 and horses 75p, that means 25p for the catapult!

2	Awesome!

2	There's no Lego Castle anywhere in England!

3	That was a great review!!!

3	very entertaining!

3	:-D love the comics!

3	Here is a review of the new Monster Dino creator set with power functions First lets start with the box which is much larger than it needs to be!!

3	It is one of the new style re-closeable boxes rather than the rip the sides style.

3	This set is typical of creator and comes with three sets of instructions.

3	The Monster Dino a kind of spider and a Crocodile The set comes with two of the new motors one small and one large, a sound module plus the new IR controler and receiver.

3	There is a mix of techniques in this set the core is mainly studless technic, there are some studded technic parts and most of the details are standard creator style.

3	There are two mechanisms one to control the legs and one to control the head and arms.

3	The leg drive is from the large motor and the arm and head are operated from the small motor The completed mechanism will stand on its own without any detail added The detail is added to the base unit to complete the model.

3	The operation of the Dino is very good the design for the motors and drives is very compact and well thought out.

3	The walking motion works well although there is no steering and it will fall over it it encounters obstacles.

3	The sound module is built into the head so when the mouth opens the Dino roars (sort of) Glyman made the comment that this set is ugly as sin and I tend to agree I think there are too many colour variations with different shades of grey, black and that lime green :-P which confuses the look of the finished model but I guess it might apeal more to younger kids.

3	I also do not like the spikes along the back, which glow in the dark, because the are loose and keep falling off.

3	This set is not cheap at ?70 but I guess this is because of the motors and IR controller.

3	While on this I was surprised how good the range was on the new controller it would still operate ever when not in direct line of sight.

3	I would give this set a 10/10 for playabilityit has kept the kid amused for hours I would give it 6/10 for value for money it is a bit pricey Overall 8/10 It took approx 3 hours to build and has been well played with I have posted some more images and some videos of the finished models on my brickshelf page HERE If you have any questions please ask Pete Edited by WhiteFang, 23 May 2009 - 06:28 PM.

3	Indexed

3	Thanks for your review Ickelpete!

3	*y* Nice little movie you made (what?s on tv in the background?)

3	;-) :-D After reading, I wonder more than before what this Dino has to do with Creator?

3	*wacko* The complete mechanism is technic, only the "design"-pieces on top are classic-style.

3	I agree with your comment on the colour-selection.

3	:-X Is that turquise next to lime?

3	Looks like - well, I?m not telling you what I think of right now... ;-) Pretty Lego set, but not for me.

3	I?m waiting for the first pics of the ferris wheel.

3	Or even better, the 8275 Technic-Bulldozer :'-) *wub* New motors On!

3	Thanks very much for that review.

3	I downloaded the instructions last week and I was largely impressed with what was in it.

3	However, like Holodoc, I am waiting for the Bulldozer.

3	I might have to settle with the dino though if Lego charge Australian some absurd price... EDIT: I just watched the videos.

3	Thanks!

3	They are great.

3	The dino is better than I thought... Edited by Sinner, 10 July 2007 - 02:29 AM.

2	Thank you very much for that interesting review, Ickelpete.

2	*y* Well, the color scheme?s pretty bad and the design of that Dino?s a bit to blocky for my liking, but the two alternative models you?ve built?re quiet nice.

2	At least there?re a lot of possibilities coming with that set.... :-)

2	Tks a lot for your review Ickelpete ;-) I saw that set at TRU a couple of weeks ago but was really not interested due to the design - I am not a fan of those motorized Lego sets |-/ I guess the lime colour is to please kids, as well as the general design, far from a real dino ;-) I am sure that its going to sell well to a younger croud.

2	Let me quote you here: Quote The walking motion works well although there is no steering and it will fall over it it encounters obstacles.

2	Hum, I really hope it works welll because I will have to buy that motorized AT-AT and I dont want it to crash :-P *yoda*

3	Ickelpete, on Jul 9 2007, 11:19 PM, said: First lets start with the box which is much larger than it needs to be!!

3	Pete No LEGO box is too big my friend X-D ;-) Nice review *y* As for the set...

3	I don't like the colors myself (surprised?

3	X-D ), and it seems a little blocky.

3	Otherwise, the set is cool.

3	I really like the head.

2	Ugly.

2	As.

2	Hell.

2	But an awesome parts pack, worthy of purchase.

3	:'-) Such a beauty, the functions are great, cool video!

3	I want to get this set so badly... Great review!

3	*y*

3	I bought this set last night and it is great.

3	My biggest surprise was the wheels that were included; I didn't even know they existed and there aren't even that new.

3	Back to the set, he is such a cute dinosaur.

3	:-D Since he is so tubby I think he looks like a baby!

3	I suspect my wife wanted him more than me.... my biggest interest in the set was to have more motors and IR parts so I could make an IR car.

3	Overall, I highly recomend this set, but as others have said, be warned that the box is very oversized.

3	I wish Lego would give up on this whole 1:1 picture thing.

3	*wacko*

1	The box is has really strange dimensions - it's very flat but has a large front - the 1:1 scale.

1	Regarding the spines, because they're made of the softer non-ABS plastic (the stuff the 1994 cutlasses and brown muskets were made of), they lose their shape a bit and so are hard to grip; they simply fall off.

1	I suppose TLC use loads of different colours because a single or two-colour dino isn't very nice to look at, especially when the surface isn't very smooth - it takes your eyes away from the surface and puts it on the colours.

1	Someone should make an all terrain dino that can walk everywhere from this set - I don't have the skill with technic - I always end up layering and never finish any models.

1	:-(

3	Thanks for the nice review.

3	It's butt ugly to me but the motors + IR control seem pretty neat !

3	Even at that high price, it looks like a good parts pack !

3	*sweet*

3	I didn't spot this great review earlier.

3	Thanks for the effort of posting all those pics and videos, they helped me decide that this set is worth getting.

3	Got this baby via shop@home a little early and I though it was time to post my view of this set : (Snefroe you NEED to get this one ;-) ) Sorry for the lack of pics but there are already many pics online of this baby So here it is : Best space set since... a way too long time This is my first new space themed set since more than 20 years and I must say that I’m not disappointed at all.

3	I have much to say about this little gem.

3	First, let’s cut it straight about the Martians minifigures: they are absolutely rubbish.

3	I can’t imagine how Lego could produce such atrocity.

3	This said; let’s move on to the dropship.

3	A real piece of art.

3	Reminiscent of the Aliens movie dropship.

3	The cockpit is spacious and provides a great field of view, too bad there is no hinges to open it, you must remove the canopy completely to switch pilot.

3	The drilling unit can be attached under the ship with the clever use of a rubber piece.

3	It stays well in place once attached, good point.

3	Some people don’t like the inclusion of the 2 containment area for the Martians and crystal on both side of the ship but I kind like it, it makes the ship less empty.

3	The 2 wings are complete with air intake, some armaments and 1 standard launcher on the right wing.

3	Normally I don’t like launchers but this one is very discrete and well integrated.

3	On the tail section are 2 thrusters that can be rotated and provide thus some “realistic” movements to the ship.

3	One of the last highlight of this ship is the landing gears, or I must say landing dishes.

3	6 medium sized radar dishes provide and incredible stability to the set.

3	They are quite sturdy and can take a beating.

3	I’m not going to review the alien spaceship in detail since it’s quite uninteresting.

3	I consider it more like a bonus addition to the set than anything else.

3	The look is passable and there are some interesting building techniques in it.

3	That’s all.

3	To end the review, a little pros/cons table.

3	(We all love pros/cons table :-) ) Pros: - Incredible design - At last a decent space set - Modular functions - Quite Sturdy - Beautiful - Great value for money Cons: - Martians are rubbish - No hinges for the canopy - The drilling unit could use some more details.

3	Score: 9/10 By the way , I added a nice cool feature on my site , you can download the stickers for some sets that I own.

3	Before building I always scan the stickers, we never know it could come handy.

2	*y* Nice review.... hmm, now I?m pretty sure that I?ll have to MOD that cockpit a little when I get that set.

3	Great review, I must admit I didn't like MM at first site, but seeing this review and looking at the MM boxes at stores appeal to me rather greatly, I may get a couple of these sets, great job!

3	*y* :-)

2	I've got it also, but i think i'll replace the ball joint pieces with the kind of pieces that give the wings their angle.

3	great review *sweet* maybe i will buy this one... but not this month... buying lego in billund has left me totally broke :-X :-$

3	i like the dropship kit and got this.

3	Now that I built it I see so many things I can do to tweak it to make it a MOC.

3	I think this is a set everyone MM fan should get.

3	Nice review!

3	The dropships looks neat, and your review is good.

3	It isn't my theme, but it clearly is a fantastic set for the space lovers under us.

3	Mars Mission is really a good step in the right direction for TLC.

1	Of course, right before I post this I see that Ickelpete reviewed this set earlier in the week.

1	Sorry for being redundant but it is already written so here ya go: Monster Dino Reviewed by Dunamis Set 4958 792 Pieces $89.95 from LEGO Online Store Build time 3.5 hours Here we go with another offering from the Creator line.

1	I?m kind of fond of these sets as they are pretty imaginative and usually have instructions for multiple models.

1	I like the reusability of all the pieces and the varied things you can build.

1	The Box: The box that LEGO shipped this thing in was absolutely huge!

1	When I first got this in the mail, I thought I had won the lottery and they had shipped the UCS Falcon early.

1	Once I opened the shipping box, I was surprised to see an unusually large Creator set box.

1	The box itself is pretty standard Creator type box but this one shows off the Power Functions prominently on the right side of the box.

1	The back of the box shows some of the motorized features as well.

1	Opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals.

1	We?re back to the reusable cereal box type tab system for those of you who stay up a night wondering about LEGO?s next box design.

1	Inside the box we have a bunch of sealed bags.

1	Immediately the power brick, remote and motors stand out as they are each in individual bags.

1	Also, there are three manuals.

1	The Manuals: The three manuals are 76, 76 and 56 pages in length.

1	They are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings: - Piece call outs for each step - Parts inventory at the end of the primary model build - Page numbers Color separation in these manuals were fine for me.

1	Interestingly, the instructions for the primary build took a full manual plus about a quarter of another manual.

1	Random manual photos: Parts list I?ll explain a bit more below, but it would have been nice to have some written documentation on all the functions of the motors, remote and receiver.

1	Such as motor load guidelines and specific explanations of all the remote control functions.

1	It is severely lacking in this area.

1	The Pieces: Obviously, the pieces we?re most interested in are these new motors and wireless remote control.

1	Note that before you fire this bad boy up, you had better BYOB.

1	Since this is prominently a European community, I had better clarify my acronyms.

1	Over here across the pond, BYOB usually means ?Bring Your Own Beer?.

1	In this case, it still means bring your own beer (I?m on my second Heineken right now) but in addition to numerous bottles of beer you will need a total of NINE batteries to get through this set.

1	I kid you not: Anyway, there are two motors (a small and a large) each with its own very unique name according to the manual; the smaller one is called ?motor?

1	and the larger one is called ?XL motor?.

1	Very creative indeed!

1	The battery box takes SIX AA batteries and there are two compartments to hold them.

1	Here is the first: That seems pretty normal.

1	However, the back side of it holds the other three batteries and it seems to be very poorly designed: Note in the photo above where the bottom battery is placed.

1	Compare it to the previous photo and you will see the difference.

1	I played around with trying to get that bottom battery out and you better pack a lunch (or BYOB) because it is no small task!

1	Why couldn?t they make this compartment just like the other side?

1	There is a single power cord connector and a three position switch.

1	The middle position turns the power OFF and the other two positions seem to provide the same functionality in either position as far as I can tell.

1	Perhaps a little blurb in the manual would have been nice to clear things up a bit.

1	The remote takes three AAA batteries.

1	It is fairly small and lightweight even with the batteries installed.

1	It has two thumb controls which could be levers if you insert Technic bars or even pins.

1	The two controls are color coded and match the plugs on the receiver to control two separate motors.

1	In addition, there is a four position switch which I assume changes the channel.

1	Finally, there are two tiny levers that seem to have no function.

1	I?m not sure if they are a trim control or variable speed control.

1	I messed with them and didn?t notice any difference in the motor speed.

1	Again, some documentation from the incredibly verbose LEGO manual would have helped.

1	As far as the rest of the parts, it?s really a mixed bag.

1	There are a lot of varied parts in this set to the point that there is almost one of everything.

1	Lots of Technic gears, pins, studded beams, studless beams, axles, wheels, etc.

1	Also, lots of little 1x1 slopes in various colors, teeth, horns, etc.

1	You can?t really say it is a parts pack because there is not enough of one thing to make it a parts pack.

1	A couple of notes: It seems the quality control issue on the axles has been fixed.

1	I initially reported this back when I reviewed the 8285 about a year ago.

1	All the axles worked fine for me.

1	The color quality control issue is still alive.

1	Check out the different shade of red in these two parts: Also included is the sound brick.

1	This looks just like the other sound or light-up bricks we have been seeing lately.

1	It does have a load dinosaur ?roar!?

1	sound embedded in it though so hide the younglings if they are a bit on the skittish side.

1	Finally, I?ve never seen one of these before (although someone will no doubt rattle off a dozen sets where you can find this part in about 5 seconds): No, I am not referring to the studded beam, I put that in the photo for scale.

1	The Build: The build was fun and was fairly straightforward.

1	As I mentioned, there is a lot of Technic parts, so if you are not a fan of the Technic line you should run, not walk away from this one.

1	There were no gotchas to speak of, but you need to pay careful attention to the placement of the wires that go from the motors to the receiver.

1	They kind of sneak them around a bit so watch closely.

1	Otherwise, it was fine.

1	Here is what is left over: So far, I have only built the primary model.

1	As seen on the box, there are instructions for two more models.

1	Both of the other models seem less complex than the primary model and are likely quicker builds.

1	The Dino took me about 3.5 hours which included some time to screw around with the motors.

1	I?m an old school Technic fan from way back in the 80?s so I had some familiarity with the old Technic motors.

1	Obviously, 25+ years has improved some things and these seem much more powerful.

1	The Design: If you have built the 4507 Prehistoric Creatures then some of the design will feel familiar, especially the head and tail.

1	It is almost like they took the dinosaur from that set and figured out how to motorize it.

1	This is not necessarily a bad thing, just a comment.

1	The set does a good job of showing off the features of the new motors and remote.

1	It is nice to see how one motor can perform multiple functions.

1	In this case, the small motor makes both arms move and opens and closes the mouth of the dinosaur.

1	When the mouth is completely open, it pushes the activation switch on the sound brick which emits the ?roar!?

1	sound.

1	Pretty cool.

1	The ?XL Motor?

1	handles the walking feature of the dinosaur.

1	There is both forward and reverse.

1	Forward works really well while the reverse just makes the dinosaur look like he is doing a Michael Jackson moon walk.

1	(Wow, I never thought I would use Michael Jackson?s name in a LEGO Dinosaur set review!)

1	It is almost like the dinosaur can?t get traction going in reverse.

1	However, as noted previously forward works really well.

1	This guy actually gets going at a pretty good clip.

1	As you might expect, he kind of waddles like a duck since there is no articulation in the knees.

1	It is a bit awkward but it works.

1	The ?XL Motor?

1	seems to kick out plenty of power.

1	Overall, the design seems to be a mixed bag.

1	The way the tail is attached seems to be an afterthought.

1	The arms look to be too small.

1	However, the walking mechanism and legs/feet are pretty cool as well as the head and mouth.

1	I guess it is a reasonable effort to get people introduced to the parts and we?ll see designs improve as time goes on.

1	Here are a few views of our new friend: But What About The AT-AT???

1	Of course, the real reason you are reading this is that you hope I will have some epiphany on how all this relates to the new walking AT-AT.

1	Judging from the box on the AT-AT, it looks like we get one motor.

1	I don?t see the remote which is a disappointment as I hope it is not controlled by a switch on the body and you either turn the AT-AT on or off.

1	If that is the case, the first thing I am doing is scavenging the receiver and remote from this set to add to the AT-AT.

1	Granted, it could be that it comes with a remote but is just not seen on the box.

1	Also, the AT-AT box looks like one of the images shows that the head turns.

1	I sure hope this is controlled separately as it would be really lame to not be able to control this independently from the walking feature.

1	I?m kind of skeptical on the walking feature of the AT-AT.

1	I suspect it will be rather cumbersome but hopefully I will be pleasantly surprised.

1	Needless to say, this is all speculation but those are my initial thoughts based on this set.

1	Overall Thoughts: It?s an OK set.

1	Kind of pricy but I suspect a large part of that is due to the motors and remote.

1	I haven?t built the other two models (they seem less interesting to me) but at least it has some variability.

1	Also, you get a ton of different parts which can either be a good thing or bad thing depending on what you are looking for.

1	The dinosaur is average.

1	The color selection is marginal (black and lime green?)

1	and the tail section is just lame.

1	I appreciate it more for the mechanical functions and how the motorized parts work.

1	It does do a good job of waking up my dog who seems pretty irritated by it.

1	It is a nice set to show off to the neighbors or the endless caravan of my wife?s friends that seem to materialize out of nowhere.

1	People are quickly impressed by it and then promptly move along once you start trying to explain how it all works.

1	I?m a bit disappointed that the manual did not explain more about the remote and motor functions.

1	I suspect that there is more than meets the eye and I?ll just have to play around with it to find out.

1	It would be nice if LEGO had a website that showed all the cool functions of the motors and remotes so we fully understand the capabilities.

1	Final Rating: 72% Build 9/10 (Pretty quick and fun.

1	The mechanical part is cool) Functionality 6/10 (It is a Creator set so you have multiple builds.

1	As far as it being a dinosaur, it?s just OK. Motorized parts are cool though.)

1	Design 6/10 (Partly cloudy.

1	Some things are cool, others are lame.)

1	Parts 8/10 (New motors and remote are cool.

1	Lots of varied parts included but nothing to write home about.)

1	Price 7/10 (It is kind of expensive) Edited by WhiteFang, 23 May 2009 - 06:23 PM.

3	Really clear photos too!

3	Thanks.

3	Dr. S.

2	A very nice review, thanks dunamis.

2	*y* I really don?t understand that color scheme, but the new motors?re very interesting.

2	Well, that Dino is just mediocre to me....

2	I think that the new Technic Bulldozer is much more interesting.

3	Great Review Dunamis I hope you have as much fun with this as I have.

3	One point yes they are new axles they have appeared in a few sets this year.

3	Yes, the kids seem to love it (as you pointed out) and the wife still thinks I am crazy so it's all good.

3	I read your review after I posted mine.

3	Seems like we shared the same thoughts on a majority of it.

3	I always think it is good to have multiple opinions on sets as it gives the community more data points to evaluate a given set.

1	I already made my 5 cents to this horrible colour bastard :-X :-X :-X in Ickelpetes thread, but I wanted to clarify about this: dunamis, on Jul 13 2007, 10:41 PM, said: Finally, I?ve never seen one of these before (although someone will no doubt rattle off a dozen sets where you can find this part in about 5 seconds): Here?s one of the sets it?s included in: It didn?t even take me 5 seconds.

3	Thanks for the bonus review.

3	I am still on the fence with this one so every opinion is good!

3	dunamis, on Jul 14 2007, 07:41 AM, said: But What About The AT-AT???

3	In case you don't know, the AT-AT in the Dark Side Development Kit had a single motor and a moving head.

3	It worked by the head simply swinging from side to side due to balence shifts.

3	I suspect the AT-AT will be same.

3	I also think that there will be no remote for it either.

3	Edited by Sinner, 14 July 2007 - 11:31 AM.

3	Tks once again Dunamis for a great in-depth review ;-) I really look forward to your supped up and moded AT-AT :-P I am really not found of the design BUT I think its still a nice parts pack, especially with all these nice "power function" elements ;-) *yoda*

3	Thats a nice looking dino set there!

3	Great review, dunamis!

3	Also, on this side of the border (see that big thing above the US?

3	Thats Canada, where I'm from) BYOB still means bring your own beer.

3	My uncle is already on his third Molsons.

2	Quote Here?s one of the sets it?s included in: It didn?t even take me 5 seconds LOL, I knew it!

1	Oh, is he ugly or what?

1	I've never seen a dino that needed to go on a diet more then him.

1	:-D But I'd get him for the pieces; all those lime-green pieces.

1	*drools* But, meh, I'm not really in to Mindstorms, so I don't think I'd get this.

1	But anyway, nice review, I now know exactly what he's like.

1	KML

3	Wow...that set is really something.

3	But I prefer Pehistoric Power, and Triceratops.

3	Or are they the same?

3	I can never tell.

3	Awesome reveiw, thanks!

3	I gotta get this one!!!

3	*y* *wub*

3	I kind of like the design of this, but more importantly I really want to get my hands on the power functions motors and IR control system.

3	I'd prefer the 8275 Technic Bulldozer, but there's no way I can stretch to the ?100 price tag, so I was thinking I would have to see if I could get a 4958 Monster Dino cheap in the January sales.

3	Then two things happened today.

3	Firstly I saw the Dino in Tescos reduced from ?70 to ?55.

3	Then my wife said she'd buy it for me for Christmas.

3	Wow!

3	That's never happened to me before.

3	I love my wife!

3	*wub* Can't wait till Christmas now!

2	If you really want the power functions the Bulldozer is better value as you get two large motors, two small motors and two receivers compared to the one in the Dino set alos watch Toysrus and argos both have had the Bulldozer for ?70-75 in there pre christmas sales usually for a week only I am hopeing they will be on sale soon as I want a Second Bulldozer to get some more motors.

2	Thanks for the tip, but even ?70-75 is too much right now.

2	?55 was just about affordable, but now my wife's buying for me it's going to cost me zero zilch zip nada nothing which is even sweeter!

2	X-D

2	I ended up buying both this and the dozer.

2	:-$ I plan on using my Dino for a IR car in a month or two...

3	I ended up buying a MISB set recently from a Lego collector who is clearing up his collection.

3	Excellent set to get the IR remote and IR receiver and other motors without paying insane amounts for the bulldozer now.

3	There is a quite a number of parts in Power miner lime green and 1x1 white teeth plate for the mouth and claws.

3	The dino alone has 20 teeth in its mouth The glow in the dark "antennas" on the backbone of the dino is a nice touch as you can let him walk in the dark somewhat.

3	I do agree with the reviewer, the box IS INSANELY HUGE!!!

3	I don't think Lego wanted to show a 1:1 scale dino, they just wanted to promote the power function stuff as large as possible.

3	Also, the remote is smaller than shown in the picture as the hand holding it I think is smaller.

3	This is both my first set review and post about a Star Wars set- (even though I have been collecting them since '99).

3	I got this one early this year so I thought I would post a review on it.

3	Please bare with me- I am not a great photographer.

3	So with that in mind, here goes!

3	I like the two AT-DP Pilots and Agent Kallus is a well done minifig.

3	I can complain about another storm trooper either Parts- 3/5- Other than the dome pieces I commented on before, there is really not any new parts in this.

3	If you build space, star wars, or machinery, this will still be a welcome assortment.

3	Experience of Build 4/5- This really was a fun build.

3	It came together fast but was challenging enough for its target age group.

3	Playability 5/5- This thing is much more sturdy than it looks.

3	The legs take a little bit of effort due to the double locking hinges but hold together very well.This is a very minor complaint.

3	Value 4/5- Typical- $49.99 for 500 pieces- I must admit I paid a little more than MSRP due to shipping but I can't complain about the value.

3	Overall: 21/25- I really believe this is one of the best walkers that Lego has designed.

3	The only changes I would make would be adding real control panels in the cockpit and it would be nice if lego made a real widow to fit in with these types of builds rather than a transparent tile over another plate.

3	All in all, I would recommend this set and I hope the rest of the 2015 Star Wars sets are on par with this.

3	Thanks for the early review!

3	I don't know much about the rebals show at all, but I can say that the over all design of the walker really appeals to me and the minifigs look top notch.

3	I also like how the spring shooters are pretty much hidden in the frame, nice job!

1	Looks really nice.

1	One complaint is the back it is a pitty that Lego didn't use any plates greebling there.

3	Great review!

3	Thanks for doing it.

3	I'm a big fan of this set, the minifigures are good, as is the parts selection.

3	I like the piece used in the cockpit to secure the minifigure in place.

3	I would've liked to see some panels in the cockpit though rather than translucent red pieces, that said however they are useful pieces.

3	Thanks for the review.

3	Cannot wait for the 2015 sets.

3	Pretty good first review!

3	This looks pretty great, I probably won't be getting it due to budget constraints.

3	(Bionicle) but still, very nice set.

3	To me it kinda looks like the missing link between when the at-st evolved into the at-at.

3	Also, I know the rebels stormtroopers get a lot of hate, but I really like them.

3	Thanks for the review!

2	Thanks for the review!

2	I have two questions: - What is the driver standing on, when the hatch is open and he is looking out?

2	- Could you show the face of Kallus without helmet, please?

2	My only complaint is that the colours of both, Kallus's and the drivers's uniforms are wrong.

2	Kallus's uniform is way too dark and should be more dark olive than black, and the drivers's uniforms are too bright and should be more greyish compared to what we saw in the series.

2	Whats behind the printed 4x4 dome?

2	Is that 2x4 yellow plate?

2	Im planning to replace that.

3	Great first review!

3	As a huge walker fan its great to get one thats not a redesign, or one of those tiny battlepack vechicles.

2	I mean, it fits the 10 cents per piece count and has 4 figures so for a licensed theme you can't beat that.

2	But I guess Lego can never satisfy everyone

3	Thanks!

3	Indeed his face printing is really nice, they captured his looks and spirit well.

2	Great set, really impressed.

2	Odd that Lego didn't include stickers for the controls - can't think of a reason they wouldn't have.

2	And why do only 3 of the 4 figures have leg printing?

2	I just can't understand Lego at times

2	But I guess Lego can never satisfy everyone This is true.

2	I just had that price in mind when I saw the first images of it.

2	it did not appear to be this big or complex, but new sets are getting so much more advanced than what they used to be.

2	I built this set and I think the two rubber pieces holding the both sides of the face is a bit stretched out therefore making the set somewhat tight for entire top hatch to open and close.

2	Does anyone have the same situation?

2	Is this right?

2	-------------- Never mind I got it!

2	I built the back a stud too long!

2	Edited by namioik, 29 December 2014 - 03:04 AM.

2	Thanks for the early review!

2	How tall is this next to the most recent recreation of the AT-AT?

2	I'm picturing the two of them standing next to each other looking silly due to the scale differences.

2	The legs are about 2" shorter than the AT-AT; its cockpit is a little larger than the AT-AT's "head;" it doesn't look out of place as an escort-type walker or heavy walker, especially as both are built in the same style, although if scale differences really bother you the most recent AT-ST is probably a better bet for you.

1	Great reveiw, shame on Lego for forgetting that they already made a AT-DP pilot helmet (Ezra's from the Phantom set) that didn't resort to needing a printed head.

2	It's a different helmet.

2	Ezra's is an Imperial Cadet Helmet (the same one he wears in "Breaking Ranks).

2	Thanks for the review and pics.

2	This is a really nice looking walker.

2	One question - how snug are the AT-DP drivers sitting in their seats?

2	The cockpit looks good.

2	Actually I'm not crazy about the AT-DP helmets on the show but I dig the minifigs!

2	Good stuff.

2	Awesome facial hair for Kallus!

3	Knightsword, on 01 January 2015 - 02:27 AM, said: I meant the mold opposed to the paint job.

3	The mold wouldn't really work.

3	The way they did it is actually very accurate.

2	hi, i need some help...when i atach the pod to the place where the legs are placed, the small piece that unites the pod to the legs is loos from the bottom, so the top of the walker just moves around freely, wich is different from every video review that i have seen (where they can rotate the pod but its not loose) the small piece that serves as the axis isnt staying locked on the bottom piece and i have reassembled it all and still its the same :\ help!

2	edit: sorry, i found out what went wrong...didnt push hard enough :D Edited by mrpinache, 05 July 2015 - 12:10 AM.

3	Super outstanding review!

3	I am outside at this moment and this review is certainly great to read while you are on the move.

3	I am looking forward to get this upcoming new modular.

3	It is definitely fun to play and real awesome indeed.

3	Thanks Oky for this very fine review.

3	A great review of an obviously fantastic set.

3	A must-have for 2015!

3	Thanks!

3	I want more of the story you made!

3	Also, ace review.

3	Brilliant review and thanks for plenty of detailed shots of the interior, I may invest in this set but ill have to wait until 2015 Star wars is sorted and budget for the arrival of Pirates in April!

3	Fantastic review, could easily be the year's best, and it's only January 1st!

3	You've got a duplicated picture in the bit where the candy is being moved from the outside and through the barber shop.. ...and I was expecting a final B&W picture or two where the detective makes his report to the woman in red, and gets his reward (candy, of course) or she in turn reports back to her real boyfriend, the candy smuggler.

2	How was the pool table legs made?

3	Firstly, Great Review ++++++ I was really on the fence on this one.

3	This review has greatly changed my view on this modular.

3	A definite buy for me.

3	Love the interiors and the whole concept.

3	The more i see it the more i see the little features which put this set apart or at least slightly different from the others.

3	Of course great playability for the younger lot and i think a nice building to give any Lego City more character and colour...

3	Great review Oky!

3	I really love your introduction text.

3	You put a lot of effort in this review, with lots of nice touches.

3	Well done For me the set gets 4 out of 5.

3	It's a great set, but there's something preventing me of giving it 5 stars.

3	Wow, that is the best start to a review I have ever seen.

3	Great job Oky, amazing set, I'll be picking it up this weekend!

3	Great review Oky!

3	I managed to pick this set up a few days ago and I must say, it might be my favorite modular yet for the feel alone.

3	The pool hall, barbershop, and the detective's office itself are all wonderfully designed!

2	Can you please take some pictures/explain how the water tower is built?

2	I understand that there are some tank treads bot how exactly?

2	And it is "There can be only one"!

3	Looking forward to picking up this set on Saturday :-) Nice review, love the tiny details and the printed parts.

1	Great review!

1	The intro was great, but I'm still not convinced on this one.

1	The height seems too small for comparison with the rest of the modulars.

1	The play features are ok but I wish it would have been taller.

2	Nice review, thanks a lot.

2	Managed to improve my opinion of the set a bit, but I'm still getting two to build larger buirldings as soon as we get the next 2x VIP points special

1	Totally agree with you, the height does seem rather small.

1	Also 2x buildings on a 32x32 base-plate with a lots of spare studs behind the buildings are these buildings 12 studs in width?.

1	It still looks great style wise, however this might be a set i buy and look at it after i have built it & regret the amount of $$$ i have spent on it.

1	$239 for us Aussie's .

3	This modular building will be my next set!

3	Thanks for the review!

2	Thank you for the review, it was very interesting and changed my opinion of the set, I'm now considering a future purchase ^^.

2	Just one question: The mirror is on cardboard?

2	I was hoping for it to be a window piece with a mirror on one side..

2	I hope it's not the same cardboard we had on some of the early Harry Potter sets or the element won't last long

2	Thank you for the great review of this set.

2	I'm also curious for the backside of the mirror.

2	Both are are 14 deep on the upper floors.

2	DO is 3 studs deeper on the ground floor, buit that's pretty much it.

2	Can't believe how cramped the upper floors of the barber shop look.

2	We've come a long way from the wide and empty halls of CC and GG.

3	Amazing review!

3	Very thorough with lots of details

3	Thanks for the review!

3	I'm a fan of the set but will be modding quite a bit.

3	Have to get a small bar into the Highlander and then turn the second/third story above the barber shop into a proper apartment.

3	The detective's office is great and will stay as is!

3	Thank you for the amazing and really well-readable review!

3	Makes me want to get the set even more!

3	Awesome review, and an awesome set.

3	What are the different shades of blue?

3	I know there's dark and medium blue, but what's the other blue?

3	Locutis

3	AWESOME review 'Oky'.....thanks for the cool writing and excellent photography........your last photo could of had a cry of......."You'll never take our candy !

3	"......well he does look Mel Gibson like !

3	This set is a serious contender for best set for 2015, so much detail .........must buy one, need to brainwash wife into buying me one !

3	Lego's affiliation with six wheelers go back a long way.

3	I think the first one was released in 1981, more than 25 years ago.

3	This year, Lego added another one to the family, Mars Mission's "Rhino 1", as its title sounds...

3	It's been a while since i've bought and opened a large box, so maybe this isn't a surprise to most of you, but the box does not open at the front, as with many larger sw boxes, but at the side.

3	The two printed seals(or whatever people call them) have gone as well, being replaced by one larger print in the middle of side... the box also isn't as thick as a large sw box, like the sandcrawler...

3	The general size is, however, still quite large.

3	PICT0001.JPG 281.91K 102 downloads the back side shows the Mars Mission theme sets... eccept the Rhino!

3	I guess it shows this set will be released as a TRU exclusive or something, only to show up in Legoland shops and maybe Lego shops...

3	It's a shame really, because this is by far the best set of the theme.

3	PICT0002.JPG 285.42K 89 downloads When you open the front cover, you see a larger picture picture of the Rhino.

3	Obviously, it seems to be some sort of multifunctional truck.

3	i think the basic function is to drive around and explore.

3	For that it has a drilling device and six giant wheels.

3	PICT0003.JPG 273.7K 82 downloads The set comes with two instruction books.

3	i'm afraid to say they did not resolve the gray/black colors issue.

3	Colorwise, the real thing does not look like the instruction book because of it... PICT0004.JPG 302.63K 75 downloads The Rhino looks really big because of the six giant wheels.

3	I guess it's more or less the same size as M-tron's Magnetiser with the big difference between the two being that the wheels have been turned around, creating a unique wheel design for a Lego model PICT0285.JPG 290.59K 83 downloads PICT0277.JPG 286.26K 80 downloads the wheels look very cool, even though the first couple of wheels stand a bit closer to each other.

3	Don't know why that is.

3	hm... |-/ and they could have used a bit more body, but the design is pretty good.

3	i know, "Armagheddon" isn't far away... |-/ PICT0292.JPG 216.75K 70 downloads The suspension of the wheels is a bit flimsy.

3	sure, it allows the truck to move around in a more realistic way than the old sets, but it's not as flexible as some older sets, like sw's CTT.

3	Nor do the wheels have much body.

3	the black bars you see on top of the wheels are more "window dressing" then functional... PICT0293.JPG 244.78K 88 downloads The over all shape of the Rhino is kinda "bulky", it looks more like a beatle than a rhino, if you're asking me.

3	It has three major sections, but i wouldn't call it a modular building though...

3	The cockpit is the first section.

3	It's spacious and detailed.

3	PICT0290.JPG 262.77K 0 downloads PICT0291.JPG 299.75K 87 downloads The cockpit hangs down from a weird angle.

3	it's attached to a large vertical technic brick that is part of the Rhino's main structure, so it's not a seperate spaceship, which is a shame... oh well... you can't have it all, i guess... PICT0301.JPG 291.13K 78 downloads ah yes... stickers all over the place, but they're cool.

3	the mid section of the Rhino dominates the basic shape of the model.

3	It's as if those two large white parts form a strong and thick shield, protecting whatever is inside from whatever is outsde.

3	PICT0007.JPG 213.22K 67 downloads unfortunately, there is nothing inside.

3	it's extra space needed to house the spaceship.

3	That's really a shame; a command center of some kind could have given the rhino a bit more "panache".

3	PICT0286.JPG 251.35K 87 downloads However, what's really great, is the way in which they fit together: one side has an orange 1x2 plate that fits in between two white 1x3 plates of the other side, creating yet another unique shape for a Lego model.

3	But again, it's a shame they didn't do more with this section... X-O PICT0283.JPG 287.75K 82 downloads The third and last section is a platform for a space ship.

3	PICT0299.JPG 289.5K 77 downloads PICT0287.JPG 199.78K 75 downloads The platform itself isn't really special.

3	no details, no stickers,... it's just a skeleton to carry the spaceship, nothing more nothing less.

3	No, your space ship doesn't fall off, even if you rotate the platform into a launch position, pushing the weight of the ship backwards.

3	In fact, the position of the ship onto the platform is so solid, it's kinda difficult to imagine how this ship flies off.

3	|-/ The ship on the other hand, is pretty cool.

3	It's all sorts of things at the same time it seems.

3	It transports two aliens, but also a small car that reminds me of the small sets of Spacepolice 2, blacktron 2,... PICT0295.JPG 307.4K 85 downloads PICT0298.JPG 268.13K 75 downloads PICT0294.JPG 276.84K 76 downloads the shuttle reminds me of a Star trek shuttle and i think it needs some modding, but i do think it looks pretty nice.

3	sure, the cockpit is a bit too low, a pilot needs to lay down instead of sitting down and the dropping mechnism, if there is one at all isn't all that brilliant either...

3	The main structure is a bit too technical for me.

3	I prefer actual parts with studs, not these Lego technic bars and pins.

3	PICT0006.JPG 224.43K 74 downloads the crew: PICT0276.JPG 239.43K 70 downloads ah yes, there's also this green plastic residu.

3	think they are supposed to be the aliens... and there's also this weird alien craft, but i didn't bother to build that... *sad* GOOD: *wub* Great, innovative design, lots of potential, i even like the colors *sweet* Lots of playability it's a big, attractive model; i don't see any weak spots in the design that could compromise stability or structural integrity.

3	NOT SO GOOD: |-/ too many technic parts, some sections on the model, like the gun and the drilling device are a bit to flimsy I'd say 7.5-8.5/10 Price: 750 Danish Crowns, about 105euro

3	Thanks very much.

3	I love it *wub* .

3	It needs tweaking, but isn't that half the fun?

3	Incidentally, when people were calling it Rhino, I thought it was just a reference to Captain Scarlet.

3	Seeing the stickers in the middle made me realise my mistake.

3	Buy!

3	Buy!

3	Buy!

3	Thanks dude.

3	This is a great set.

3	Can you please take more pictures?

3	Thanks

2	seems like they infuse system sets with more technic bars.

2	must be that technic isn't selling too well and they want to educate ppl how cool technic can be.

2	:-P it's quite apparent when even the small bike needed technic frame.

2	my guess it's less expensive and complicated to produce.

2	they're also using these parts in other themes, so in the end, they're producing a smaller catalog of bricks but every part gets produced in larger quantities.

3	Wow.

3	This year, my wallet size has been bugging me.

3	*Sigh* still, it's a good-looking set and i will get it.

3	Too many big sets...

2	This is a great review and so is the set *y* I thought I would buy it, but when I saw the price...

2	I changed my mind X-D I always liked flying things better though... Like the Dropship...

2	Although that is a BIT pricey too, I guess X-D

2	This set is truely incredible, a must have.

2	BUT this set is also incredibly overpriced *n* !

2	Com' on it's only a big vehicle , nothing really special to justify the near 100?

2	price tag.

2	This set is clearly worth something like 65?

2	at max.

2	Look at the incredible dropship for 34?, that's a good value for money!

2	*y* Edited by mutex, 15 July 2007 - 04:57 PM.

2	Thanks for that very interesting review, snefroe1.

2	*y* That vehicle looks really nice, with a lot of playability, but too much Technic brick construction for my liking.

2	It seems like there?s pretty much space wasted inside of it, some kind of small laboratory or a room for the crew and at least a mining toolshed would?ve been cool.

3	Awesome review, if I pick up any MM sets, it will definately be this one!

2	I echo the consensus of this thread - too much technic, looks great, too expensive, looks great.

2	Please build the alien craft, I'm sure that we would all like a review of that!

3	That's a great programme, is it not?

3	And I mean both new and old.

3	Anyway, I like this.

3	I'll probably get it when it finally becomes available in the UK.

3	I think there's a few things I'll MOD, but overall it's very nice.

3	Although it's interesting (and slightly creepy) how much the lights at the front look like eyes... And, as I've said many a time before, I love the motorbike!

2	^_^' Bleh, I don't care much about the alien ship, they all look too much alike, the humans would kick the aliens crap out of them.

1	I wish the wheels would be arranged like the turbo tank, this one looks too movable.

3	Nice Review *y* I have quick question though.... Do the crystals fit into the aliens hands?

3	Try and stick one in there,Becuase the new catalog shows an image of an alien holding a crystal Lastly lego should have made the aliens with movable arms and no hole in the middle |-/ I don't want to waste any money so I am only going to grab 1 or 2 of the smaller sets Piranha EDIT:IMO the aliens would win becuase they have superior technology and all they do is have to cut the airtank line and the humans die Edited by Piranha, 20 July 2007 - 01:40 AM.

3	Yes, they can hold the crystals.

3	They can't move the hands ( |-/ ) but they do have the clawlike hand of the droid arm.

3	EDIT: Could you post some general 'beauty' pics of the Rhino and the attached craft, such as front, side, back, etc.

3	All we have of the ship is one top pic... Edited by Mr. Mandalorian, 20 July 2007 - 05:18 AM.

2	Say, I was looking at your pics and then at the instructions and I just realised : haven't you put the stikers on the shield thingies in the middle upside down?

2	I think you did :-D I don't know if I like those new sets, though...

2	I mean they have great shapes and potential, but at the same time, they seem so holey...

2	They're really huge and big but full of empty air and space as well... Well, this one not as much, and indeed it is the best looking set of the lot, though...

2	But I don't think I'll go into that line...

3	snefroe1, on Jul 16 2007, 07:19 AM, said: ok then... i'll do that later on... but I will NOT touch that plastic residu!

3	X-D You touched them to put them in their holders in the ship.

3	So in theory, you will not review them.

3	Anyways, nice review.

3	I don't think I'll get this though.

3	I'm trying to decide between this, moble devastator, or anothe 90$ set.

3	I need to get something large before my B-day...

3	Regards, ~VBBN~

3	8-?

3	such a wonderful machine!

3	Great review!

3	Too bad all my money is going towards the castle theme!

3	>:-( My wallet is planning to kill me!

3	Great review, wonderfully detailed.

3	Don't care for the ship at all.

3	It's that 'technic under a hollow shell' thing like the CTT.

3	If it wasn't for the figures, I would have hated it, and nothing about these figures excites me.

3	I'll end up finding the least number of sets possible to provide at least one of each figure for the general population collection and skip the rest (unless they do as I expect and flop here, thus leading to huge discounts).

3	I like this set ... at half off.

3	;-)

3	The Life on Mars theme was so much better, with the aliens dominating Mars instead of the humans.

3	And the aliens were so much better, with their own names etc.

3	Good times.

3	Anyway, I think this is the best set in the series.

3	It looks so neat and reminds me of the Pelican form Halo.

3	X-D Edited by iamded, 31 August 2007 - 05:11 AM.

1	I agree iamded, Life on Mars, while not even that truly great, was far better than this line!

1	>:-( I am hoping the next space line Lego does takes place in just that!

1	Space!

1	|-/ By the way iamded, I continue to stalk you....... Batbrick Away!

1	>:-)

3	I think the Life on Mars series was great.

3	Although I didn't click until the line was gone that the red hangar on the alien base was for the red mech, and same with the blue one.

3	Man, I was gutted when I realised that, I want those mechs!

3	However, the base was great, with the small mech and the flying crafts.

3	Could the LoM mechs have been the spark of life for Exo-force?

3	8-?

2	Lego 41062 Elsa's Sparkling Ice Castle Lego managed to get a Frozen licensed set in the new wave of Disney Princess sets.

2	However, I'm VERY surprised by the size.

2	It's a $40 set and comes in a small Friends-style box (roughly 12"x12" size) - I almost didn't see it on the shelf when I was looking for it because it's so small.

2	I mean, I know it's only $40 but it's a friggin' CASTLE.

2	And why did Lego only make this a smaller set?

2	If they'd made a $200 Frozen castle they still would have sold every one they could produce.

2	They made big Harry Potter Hogwarts sets and those sure sold.

2	And have you SEEN the toys in the Frozen section of stores?

2	HUGE playsets for Barbie-sized dolls.

2	But I suppose I'm getting the cart before the horse here, reviewing before I've even opened the box.

2	So..... Name: Elsa's Sparkling Ice Castle Set Number: 41062 Pieces: 292 Price: $39.99 Minifigs: 3 Theme: Disney Princess Year of Release: 2015 Links: Bricklink Peeron Brickset The Box The front of the box is standard Lego fare, other than the large Anna and Elsa in the bottom right corner.

2	Oh, and surprisingly, nowhere on the box is the normal minifig lineup.

2	The only way to know what characters are included is to look at the set pictures.

2	The 1:1 This set uses one of the minidolls as the actual size sample.

2	That's probably not a bad choice since the minidolls are not nearly as well known as a minifig.

2	The Back On the back, the play features are shown in insets around a rear view of the castle.

2	Like Friends sets, you also have an array of play accessories.

2	The Seals Is this standard on 2015 sets or is this specific to this set?

2	I've never seen 3 tape seals on a set.

2	Even huge modulars or Technic sets only have 2, so 3 on a set this small seems excessive.

2	Perhaps Lego expects people to try to steal the dolls?

2	If so, why bother with extra tape?

2	A tiny pocketknife makes quick work of the tape so the third strip doesn't even slow you down.

2	The Contents In the box are 2 instruction booklets (bent), a white plate, a sticker sheet, and 3 numbered bags of parts.

2	The Stickers These are very hard to photograph since they're shiny.

2	I mean polished chrome shiny.

2	Those dark lines across the corners are not really there, they're reflections of my ceiling.

2	The Manual Backs The back of one booklet has a Friends "Win!"

2	girl.

2	The other has an ad for the Lego Disney Princess website.

2	That site is SO girly there's even sparkles following your mouse cursor around.

2	So I didn't stay too long or look too deeply.

2	The Sample Page The interior pages of the manuals are on lavender backgrounds.

2	It's standard Lego instructions with part callouts and insets when needed.

2	The Build, 1 The first thing you build is Anna, but I'm not showing that yet.

2	Then you build this little picnic scene.

2	It's tiny but effective, and nice to have something not icy in the set since the movie has the "In Summer" song for Olaf.

2	I'm curious what's in that sandwich though - green and pink?

2	After the picnic is the Olaf build, but I'll save him for later too.

2	The Build, 2 Next is this small sleigh.

2	It has an amazing amount of style for something so small.

2	The curved front and decorative whips on the back make it look sleigh-like instead of blocky.

2	But come on, it already had pink accents, are the pink flowers really necessary?

2	Technically, yes, so the whips can mount to them, but still, it's just over-girly for my taste.

2	The Build, 3 The sleigh needs a ramp to help it rocket along (for a couple inches, at least).

2	The ramp starts like this, with a hidden lime green jumper plate that gets a cookie on it.

2	I couldn't remember anything in the movie like that, so I asked my wife and she couldn't either.

2	A hidden cookie under a hill?

2	The Build, 4 After putting the tilting 2x8 onto the base and adding decorations, this is the result.

2	A lime green bucket holding a pair of ice skates, a flower (in the snow, really?

2	), green and white round studs that I assume are supposed to be grass and snow?

2	The Build, 5 The sleigh looks huge sitting on top of the tiny hill, but it actually works pretty well.

2	Assuming you're on a smooth surface like a table, you can give the sleigh a little nudge and it'll shoot down the ramp and a few inches across the table.

2	The unevenness of the slopes vs the blue tiles holds the sleigh in line well, and the bumps in the slopes don't seem to hamper anything.

2	The Build, 6 Moving on to bag 2.... man that's a lot of colors in this base already.

2	And I'm already starting to feel like there's trans-blue cheese thrown around randomly.

2	The Build, 7 Continuing (and rotating), some steps and even more colors thrown in.

2	Magenta?

2	In Elsa's ice palace?

2	I sure don't remember any of that...

2	The Build, 8 Wait, seriously?

2	An ice cream stand in the castle?

2	That is what the magenta is for?

2	I kinda actually like the looks of it, but it doesn't fit the set.

2	The Build, 9 Spinning back around, now there's a light aqua spiral staircase added along with a roof.

2	This is where I'm really starting to wonder about Lego's thinking.

2	Those light aqua stairs, and the light aqua 1x4 tiles, are exclusive to this set (as far as I know... it's possible some other 2015 sets use them, but nothing in Bricklink yet).

2	Seems expensive (to produce) to me, when there's no huge reason to need them.

2	Another blue for the tiles would have been fine.

2	And the spiral stairs?

2	Really?

2	Elsa's castle is KNOWN for staircases, but NOT spiral ones!

2	There should be a huge straight ice stairway out front or sweeping curved stairs inside, but not a spiral.

2	The Build, 10 And now we finish the tree.

2	Again, why?

2	Where is there a tree next to Elsa's castle?

2	And so weird... with ice hanging from green branches that have both snow and flowers on them.

2	Huh?

2	Did Lego watch a different movie?

2	The Trans-Light Blue Bits Before looking at the upper level, a brief pause to look at some other parts.

2	Here's the 1x2x5 brick in trans-light blue and the 2x4x6 rock panel in glitter trans-light blue.

2	Do those look like the same blue to you?

2	And again, ANOTHER unique part for this set.

2	Why do those rock panels need to be glitter, when Lego made the same panel in trans light blue in 2013 and 2014 for SuperHeroes, Friends, and Chima sets?

2	Apparently Disney REALLY wanted glitter, because there are a bunch of trans-glitter parts in the new Princess sets.

2	There's trans-neon green cones for Jasmine; Ariel, Jasmine, and Sleeping Beauty all get glitter trans purple cones.

2	So there's a bunch of new glitter parts for 2015.

2	The Build, 11 Back to building - time to add the upper level.

2	We get a bedroom with a decent bed, although stickered.

2	The Build, 12 The other side of the bedroom has some little accessories.

2	Perfume and a crown I assume?

2	The Build, 13 Time for walls and a roof.

2	I like the small white macaroni bricks for a wall, but what's with the lavender fence piece in the center?

2	I'll grant that it looks nice (a common white fence would have been a little boring), but it's ANOTHER unique piece to this set.

2	The Build, 14 The very top of the castle is built separately.

2	Not a whole lot to say here other than why is there a torch in an ICE CASTLE?

2	The Finished Castle Once the roof is put on, the castle is done.

2	And that big purple star on top says everything to me about the styling.

2	It just doesn't look like modern Lego to me; it looks like this should be an old Belville fairy tale set from around 1999.

2	If I saw a photo of just the castle with no figs (or picnic blanket), I'd assume that's what it was.

2	The Oops, Not Actually Done Yet Accessories At the end, there's a few bits left to add.

2	There are these dark purple skis (yup, another unique part) in the lower level.

2	Let me tell you, they're a pain to get into that location, at least with my big man hands.

2	More Accessories The top level gets a stickered book.

2	The sticker has a nice castle image on it that is, while not quite exactly the castle from Disney World, VERY Disney-looking.

2	I actually had to google and see if that's the castle they use in their logo.

2	Nope, but it's the same style.

2	The Leftovers There are a LOT of extra parts in this.

2	That's almost 10% of the part count in the set right there!

2	They are pretty useful overall though.

2	It's great to have an extra "carrot" and brown "branch" for Olaf, since you know those will get lost as he's played with.

2	The Figs Finally, the reason for the set.

2	Let's face it, the castle set is just an excuse to make these figures.

2	And they're GREAT.

2	I mean just fantastic.

2	The print on them is just such a good match to the real characters.

2	Compare to the cartoon version from the front of the box.

2	Elsa's hair is a little darker than the cartoon, but overall these are just dead on.

2	If I had to pick out a flaw, it's the "spell" Elsa is holding.

2	It's too bad she can only shoot it forward with her arm down like that.

2	It'd be nice to have the end of the splash part bent 90 degrees so she can have her arm forward and the spell shooting forward too.

2	Oh, one other thing.

2	The minidoll heads don't press down tight to the body like minifig heads do.

2	There's still exposed neck.

2	It looks nice, but it means Elsa's cape can swing around.

2	The Fig Backs Elsa's cape is glittery on the back and you can see the removable bow in her hair.

2	The Full Set One final issue.

2	When you put Anna on the sleigh, her cape doesn't have enough flexibility (since it's a wraparound kind) and so it folds out funny.

2	That's why on the back of the box it shows her standing on the back of the sleigh with Elsa in the seat.

2	Edit: How on earth did I forget to comment on those orange flowers to each side of the castle?

2	I'm pretty sure Elsa did NOT have any flowers blooming outside her castle!

2	The Conclusion Hm.

2	I really wanted to like this set, but I just can't quite bring myself to.

2	It feels like Lego pulled a random castle design from the files then redid it into white and trans blue to look icy and allow a Frozen tie in set.

2	The figs are great, but the castle isn't.

2	I guess the real castle in the movie would be a boring set and this one has play features, but it just is too different for my taste.

2	The Ratings Value: 7/10 - $40 for less than 300 parts is high (especially when so many of the parts are tiny, but on the other hand there's a LOT of rock panels and 1x2x5 trans blue panels), but the figs help save it.

2	Design: 4/10 - Not one of Lego's best.

2	Not as bad as the lows in the 90s, but not a great set.

2	Minifigs: 10/10 - Possibly even a 12/10.

2	They ARE the reason to buy the set .

2	Playability: 8/10 - There are a bunch of play features, but they actually detract from the design, so I had to knock off a couple points.

2	Parts: 7/10 - A bunch of impractical unique parts (how often do you need dark purple skis or a lavender fence piece?)

2	but also a bunch of nice parts if you wanted to make your own icy scene.

2	Overall: 7/10 - A great bunch of figs, but I'd recommend not bothering with the manuals.

2	Just use the parts to build your own castle that's better.

3	Two of my daughters are building this as we speak.

3	I agree the design is a lot smaller than I would have liked, but they're loving it.

3	No question the figures are the real draw here.

3	And at 6 and almost five years old they're doimg a good job building so far.

3	At least for the 4-6 range in my house, this set is a home run.

3	Thanks for the great review, Mostlytechnic!

2	I managed to get two sets for my twin girls for Christmas, and would have to agree with your ratings (the Anna and Elsa figs are indeed excellent)

3	Very nice review, mostlytechinc!

3	Once I saw this set I was interested in it for the colours and pieces...thanks for this review to shed more light onto it!

1	Isn't getting parts in new colors a good thing?

1	It is a shame there is only this one set, I think TLG could make a whole subtheme out of Frozen.

1	I do agree that they overuse lavender and magenta, I don't see why every girl set has to have these sort of colors instead of what would be accurate to the source material .

2	Sure, new colors are good.

2	But cramming a bunch of oddball ones into a single set where they don't even make sense just seems financially unwise for Lego.

2	I'd rather have seen a larger set than light aqua spiral staircase parts.

2	Or lavender tiny fences.

2	Lego made the stairs in dark purple last year for Rapunzel's Tower, and those probably would have been ok here.

2	Or make them in a more useful color like WHITE.

3	Thanks for the review mostlytechnic.

3	I too wish they had done a real castle for this set, it certainly deserved it.

3	My sons and I figure they could have used the old rock monster mold from Rock Raiders in white for the missing snow beast.

3	I will pick it up though for the figs and unique pieces.

1	Thanks for the review!

1	I have the same opinion about the design, looks like Belville.

1	I bought it on Legostore Orlando December 30th.

1	It was impressive.

1	My wife saw them putting on shelf, 8 or 10 boxes.

1	She ran and grabbed the last one!

1	The girls faces around it was indescribable, mix of ecstasy and afraid to loose it.

1	It happened in less than 2 minutes.

1	My 7 yo girl didn't want it.

1	She likes the dresses but hates the movie.

1	Prefers Lego Movie.

1	But my 2 yo girl who never saw the movie grabbed it for good, and we bought it.

1	Lego will sell it like water, but I do not understand why a set so small.

1	It is the WORST SET DESIGN since the introduction of Lego Friends.

1	My 7 yo has more than 50 Lego friends minifigures, all the Lego fiends stores and concluded that the castle had a terrible design.

1	She is 7!!

1	Let's be honest, Lego should have released this sets months before this Christmas and is loosing a perfect opportunity to sell a decent set, with much more pieces.

1	I am wondering if they are going to make another set with the same characters.

1	At the end,.

1	It is just for the minifigures.

1	When I first saw the pictures, I didn't realize that this set had so much color barf going on in it.

1	Also, there is a bunch of stuff that does not fit in with the movie, and it is pricey.

1	The minifigures are nice, but no Kristoff or Sven.

1	I thought about getting this, but this review is pushing me towards no.

1	Yep, my family all thinks they should have made a bigger set, added figs, and just been printing money.

1	This feels massively rushed into production.

1	Which is weird, the other princess sets that just came out look worlds better.

3	I wish Elsa had more of a white hairpiece rather than blonde.

3	But it could be worse.

3	Not a bad set overall, although Olaf doesn't look right without the twigs on his head.

3	Anna is a really nice and accurate fig.

2	The review is very well done.

2	Thanks!

2	I don't know the movie.

2	My key question is whether the bricks in the set will allow to build my own snow/ice creations.

2	Now, with "trans-glitter" being part of the design approach I am not so sure.

2	Can those who have already bought it tell me: can trans-glitter be used as "transparent with snow particles" or is it just terrible?

2	I cannot really tell from the review pic above.

3	I think the trans-glitter blue panels can be icy or snowy just fine.

3	I'm sure that's WHY they used them for this set.

3	Now, if you're looking for realism (like the photos in your sig seem to be), it might be tougher.

3	But I've been thinking about using those big glittery panels to make a waterfall-type scene.

3	I'm literally of the exact opposite opinion to OP here.

3	I love the structure and the parts (this is a fantastic little parts pack that I'll be snagging more of when I find it again)...but I've no use for the figures (not a big Disney Princess fan).

3	It's all about the parts.

3	This set is freaking amazing!

3	:D

3	Well, the good news for you is you're in luck whenever you find sets, since the figs sell for a good bit of money :) Right now the bricklink value of the 3 figs is about $30!

2	The guys over in the historic forum will kill me if my MOCs start to glitter I'll take a closer look when I see the set in a shop (and, as I understand, I can sell the minifigs for the price of the set...).

3	Very nice review indeed and I also can't wait for the release of this set.

3	It will be a superb wonderful addition to the LEGO Disney Princess theme.

2	I'm pretty sure I've gotten other sets recently with three pieces of tape on them.

2	I see the cookie smugglers from the Detective's Office have already infiltrated other Lego themes.......

2	There is a very simple reason for the flowers and green-leaved trees; you should remember from the movie it was actually summer when Elsa set of the eternal winter… The orange flowers do bother me, from a design point of view; I would have liked it better if they were a pink/purple/blue/white color.

2	Same goes for the leafy bits; they could have used the pink/purple ones they are gonna use in the Elves sets.

2	It would have been fantastic if they had given us WHITE leafy bits (like snow covered branches)!

2	I'm sure loads of us could use those in our MOCs!

2	Edited by Bennemans, 13 January 2015 - 06:14 PM.

3	Thanks for the review.

3	This will end up being a must buy for my daughter.

3	Great review!

3	I definitely agree, the minidolls are too awesome and are definitely a must-have.

3	I love all the extra pieces from any set, some of them go on my phone case.

1	So why are there non-winter bits in this set?

1	Doesn't make sense.

1	The picnic is because they wanted a mini-vignette for Olaf to fit into, but the rest of the green and flowers don't make sense.

1	Thanks for the FP, but "a lovely sweet review?"

1	I thought I bashed this set pretty hard

3	This seems to be one of those sets that LEGO really should have released a month before Christmas, it likely then would have been toy of the year 2014,

2	I'm trusting there is something else going on behind the scenes because this should have been a huge set and released in November of 2014 at the latest.

2	Maybe we will see more and better Frozen sets when the post-Christmas consumer spending wave hits.

1	Hello everyone, I am back to share with all of you, another of my Legends of Chima polybags review.

1	It will be pretty comprehensive since the finished built will be quick and will be focusing more of what kind of fun that you can derive from there.

1	This polybag was bought in September 2013, when I visited LEGOLAND Malaysia and I did not hesitate to put this in my shopping basket.

1	Name: 30253 Leonidas Jungle Dragster Theme: LEGO System / Legends of Chima Year: 2013 Pieces: 30 Minifigs: 1 minifigure Price: USD N.A, GBP N.A, EURO N.A, SGD N.A Resources: Brickset, BrickLink An original polybag image of the 30253 Leonidas Jungle Dragster Back view of the original polybag image of the 30253 Leonidas Jungle Dragster The road scout of the Lions Tribe This polybag design is definitely plan to be the quickest and fastest dragster to recce enemy front by making a swift scout for the Lions Tribe.

1	I believe by the sound of the name, Jungle Dragster, it might just be suitable to use in jungle terrain.

1	Well, I don't quite agree that this is a 'Dragster' even though it has the kind of open view concept of rolling in fast but it does not have the length of a typical dragster, similar to this Town polybag design, for example.

1	Still, it is nice to have smaller variants of their vehicular supremacy.

1	Instruction Manual (Front) Instruction Manual (Back) The LEGO building content With just 30 LEGO elements, you can be pretty quick to be able to display these laid out content.

1	After the built is completed, these are the remaining spare parts.

1	I am fond of the wheels which are some useful parts, other than that, there are nothing spectacular about it.

1	My name is Leonidas and I belonged to the Lions Tribe Do not be mistaken of his name, Leonidas to be the King of Sparta who led the brave men of 300 Spartans Warriors to fight to the death against the Persians.

1	Instead this character is based on the bio resided in LEGO.com, you will realise that he is aligned with the Lions tribe and is a proud Lion foot-soldier.

1	He may have that goofy idiotic look but he can be very serious in his commitment to discharging his duties.

1	You are able to observe his nice back view printing which reveal his black and blue sash.

1	Leonidas has a dual facial feature to reveal his much serious appearance.

1	Leonidas is one of the common characters available in the Legends of Chima universe.

1	It can be found in a total of five sets.

1	It is a great pity that there is no weapon being made for him in this polybag design which will certainly make a fine addition.

1	The completed built of the Jungle Dragster This is the main design of the Jungle Dragster which is very simple looking.

1	There is no distinct fighting capability from the vehicular design and it look just like a regular patrol vehicle.

1	One thing I like about this, is the close distinct colour schema of the Lions Tribe.

1	Other than that, there is nothing special about it.

1	Moving off with my Jungle Dragster To conclude, this polybag is really meant for LEGO fans or collectors who appreciate Legends of Chima or wanting to sample the Legends of Chima theme.

1	It is a very simple built, but yet could form a decent force size for recce purposes before sending in the big arsenals to whack their enemies.

1	Either way, I will only suggest you to buy it if you really love this theme at an inexpensive price.

1	Otherwise, it is perfectly alright to give this a miss.

1	Summary review Playability: 4/10 (You need to have more Lions Tribe vehicles in order to bring the best and fun out of it since this is more of a supporting vehicle.)

1	Design: 4/10 (Simplistic built of the dragster and main focus is just acquiring the minifigure.)

1	Price: 4/10 (Bought at about USD$7, which is not an awesome price, so get it if you can get it more than half of this price.)

1	Overall: 4/10 (If only you are a huge mega fan of the Legends of Chima, then you need to get this.)

1	I gave it a "2" based on my Review Score Card.

1	What about yours?

1	I hope every one of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine.

1	Comments and Criticisms are strongly welcomed.

1	Pictures can be found in My Flickr.

3	I love how the front/hood looks like a lion.

1	Good and helpful review again, WhiteFang.

1	I probably have no use for a lionish creature with goofy looks...

2	What's up pups?

2	I have written a review for 7786 Batcopter: The Chase for Scarecrow on my website: BrickZone.net As usual it involves Fabuland figures involved in a crazy story.

2	Enjoy and feel free to let me know what you think.

2	Thanks!

2	X-D click on the picture to read the review...

3	Thanks for this review, I love this set *wub* That batman is great, and I've always loved that awesome scarecrow fig.

3	That new pumpkin is fantastic, I can't wait to get it in the set...how many come with the set?

3	I hope more than two :'-( I love both of those vehicles, this set is a definite buy for me!

3	I love the new pumpkin heads.

3	The story involved more mini-fig cruelty; excellent!

3	I also liked the scarecrow/crow joke.

3	:-D (One request; please don't say lines like "To the Batcopter" next time.

3	That is the old TV series and I hated that.

2	(Mum bought it for me.)

2	I tend to put in on if I have friends over and I am drunk enough.

2	I like the darker side of Batman only, and thus anything that is against the idea that Batman is as big a loon as the guys that he hauls in I don't like.

2	Joel schumaker's movies fall well within that category.

2	But I am not too badly done by.

3	When i first saw pic's of the bi-plane i wasn't sure if i liked it or not, but after seeing it in more detail i gotta say i love the thing *wub* It's a great plane with so many good aspect's, it's also the perfect counter vehicle for the new bat-plane.

3	For me though the best part of the set has got to be the new pumpkin heads, those are just beautiful and i cant wait to get lots of them.

2	Nice review.

2	The Batcopter is pretty neat, but I prefer Scarecrow's bi-plane.

2	Bianca: Is that really what it's called?

2	Batsy: Beats me... Nooo... it's Batarang.

1	Great review!

1	Funny as allways!

1	The comic was just a hell lot of fun.

1	It really had me laughing.

1	I would love to have this set but the price is just to high here, far worse than I had expected.

1	I'll be better off buying the Battank, which is much better priced.

1	Actually there is almost no price difference between The Batcopter and The Battank here *wacko*

3	Tks mate for this brilliant review :-D I loved your Batfabuland story !!

3	Always fantastic to read like always *sweet* I really love this set and I shall buy 2 copies: one to build as is, and another one for my town loool: regular biplane for the tarmac, and my swat copter ;-) BTW, I would have a request: could you post pic(s) of the parts inventory please ;-) Many tks in advance !!

1	*wacko* 450 and 500!

1	Indeed; you should just buy the tank.

1	Comparing the price of the Tank to the Batwing you seem to be getting quite a good deal there.

1	Both are over priced for Australians and the Tank is twice the price of the copter.

1	(They are 60 AUD and 120 AUD.)

1	I am still not sure if I will buy either... :'-( Edited by Sinner, 18 July 2007 - 11:47 AM.

3	Thanks for the review.

3	I'm definitely getting this, mainly becasue it's Batman.

3	I love the blue Bats, the Scarecrow is good as ever, and those new pumpkins are just *wub* .

3	There's a few things I'll MOD, but nothing really major.

3	I'll have to wait till I get this to decide properly though.

2	What a fine review and what a funny story, thanks!

2	*y* Dark tan and new Technic hub.... very interesting.

2	Scare the crow on!

2	:-D

2	Very nice review *y* :-P :-D

3	I am pleased to say that I didn't know that "the jig is up!"

3	was also a common line.

3	Most of what I remember about the old Batman TV show actually comes from the movie as I own that.

3	(Mum bought it for me.)

3	I tend to put in on if I have friends over and I am drunk enough.

3	I like the darker side of Batman only, and thus anything that is against the idea that Batman is as big a loon as the guys that he hauls in I don't like.

3	Joel schumaker's movies fall well within that category.

3	Wait, what?

3	Are you saying you prefer the Joel Schumacher films?

3	If you like the darker side of Batman, I recommend the Tim Burton films.

3	Joel Schumacher is as campy as "the jig is up" IMO.

3	He added freakin' nipples to the batsuit for God's sake!

3	:-P You'd have to be nice and drunk to enjoy his films.

3	;-) I really like Batman, Batman Returns and Batman Begins.

2	If anything, the new film is the best one.

2	And it didn't irreparably kill the baddie at the end... |-/ I love the 60s show, even though I've only seen the movie.

2	Sure it was camp, not Batman, and often ridiculous, but so what?

2	Besides, it's the comics that rule, so there!

2	"Holy opinions, Batman!"

2	:-D

2	What about the cartoon???

2	Batman: The Animated Series will always be the definitive Batman to me.

2	The two Tim Burton movies were okay (they haven't aged well though), and I really dig what Christopher Nolan is doing with the new movies.

2	Christian Bale did a fine job in "Batman Begins" ... but when I watch the movie, I hear Kevin Conroy's voice in my head.

2	The cartoon rocked.

2	And as much as I enjoyed the Justice League Unlimited cartoon, my biggest complaint was always: more Batman please!

3	Looks like a nice set - I like the mix of dark Batman-pieces and a bit lighter Badmans-pieces.

2	I didn't like how he insisted on wasting time with the backstory, and I especially didn't like the certain over repeated lines like "Mr Wayne, why do we fall down" and "You should learn to mind your surroundings."

3	Out of nowhere this set appeared at my local TRU.

3	Hadn't been expecting this one for a while, so a nice surprise.

3	*sweet* Firstly the box.

3	Nice pic on the front.

3	Good selection of minifigs.

3	The officer and pilot look cool with their dark blue trousers.

3	A new R2 unit as well.

3	Don't remeber this in the film, but great to have one in a new colour.

3	*wub* Back of the box shows some of the ship's nifty features.

3	First thing you notice when you open the box, is the awesome selection of bricks.

3	This makes a for a great parts pack.

3	Loads of unusual red and dark red pieces.

3	It's so refreshing to see a Star Wars set that isn't predominantly grey.

3	There are also two instruction booklets.

3	As soon as you open the first booklet you hit an error.

3	Why would I want two Obi-Wans?

3	:-| It's also at this point that you come across a big disappointment.

3	On the box you get a flesh Qui-Gon.

3	What is actually in the box is an EpIII Obi-Wan.

3	Come on LEGO - why change it?

3	|-/ All the figures look impressive in the flesh despite the BIG mistake.

3	Once I started the build it progressed rapidly.

3	Red pieces seem to be a lot easier to find.

3	Lots of clever techniques.

3	Quite a few Technic elements get used at the start.

3	It reminded me of building a Technic set from the 80s at times.

3	Here is the main body half way through the build.

3	The landing mechanism is a nice touch.

3	Its not fully retractable, but still folds away nicely.

3	You find the ship keeps tipping over as you build it despite the feet, as it's only at the end thay it all becomes evenly balanced at both ends.

3	Here the feet are extended.

3	You can also see the yellow knob that rotates the radar on top of the ship.

3	Landing gear up viewed from the front.

3	Here are the radar.

3	A great collection of dishes.

3	They spin easily with little friction.

3	Here is the ship at the half way point.

3	The front works well with the top flipping up to squeeze in the pilot.

3	More to come... :-)

2	You're second post on this forum and already you bring us this great review.

2	Thanks for making this !

2	!

2	Thanks for this great review *y* :-) And Welcome to eurobricks *n* Whats with the obi wan head???

1	What's up Kernow!!??

1	Nice review.

1	Thanks for sharing.

1	Welcome to Eurobricks, I hope you have fun here!

1	:-D X-D That Qui-Gonn thing is weird.

1	Come on LEGO!

1	Someone is just asleep at the wheel over there with quality control.

1	Missing pieces, injections molds, slipping quality, ice cube trays...IMO, that's a huge thing to miss.

1	The mini-fig on the box doesn't come in the set=false claims.

1	Anyway, the ship looks beautiful and I wanted this set when I first saw it and your review confirms that it is very cool.

1	Thanks again!

3	7665 Review Part 2 The second half of the build goes quicker than the first.

3	Once you start to add the engines, the ship really begins to take shape.

3	The main body of the ship has a few surprises hidden away under a removable cover.

3	Inside you get some retracting guns, a storage box, a little shuttle and space for a droid and figure.

3	Here is everything you can fit inside.

3	The guns are concealed behind the side vents.

3	Pushing them forward causes the vents to open.

3	Closed: And open: The final feature is the passenger area/escape pod.

3	Inside is plenty of space for two figures.

3	The pod cleverly attaches by pushing the front section of the ship forward, sliding the pod in, then returning the front.

3	Everything locks together and is held securely in place by an elastic band.

3	:-) Here's a couple of pictures of the final model.

3	It's not the most beautiful creation ever, but it is an excellent representation of the ship from the film.

3	The angular shape actually suits a LEGO build well.

3	There's one more useful feature.

3	The whole ship can be safely and comfortably picked up by two ball ended Technic pins towards the back end.

3	It balances well at this point and does allow you to swoosh the ship around much more easily.

3	This was the most enjoyable Star Wars build I've had in a long time.

3	Everything progresses nicely with almost no repetitive bits.

3	The ship looks good and is also HUGE!

3	*sweet* Compare it to the 6211 ISD and you'll see it's only fractionally smaller.

3	When I first saw pictures of this on the internet I thought it looked OK. Once you see it for real it is much more impressive.

3	For ?69.99 in the UK I'm not complaining.

3	It's the best value Star Wars set of the year so far.

3	To conclude: Pieces: 9/10 Minifigures: 7/10 (would be a 9 apart from the stupid Qui-Gon/Obi-Wan head error) Playability: 8/10 Originality: 9/10 Set Design: 8/10 Overall: 8.2/10 The box says this is a Limited Edition set (whatever that means).

3	So if you're planning to get it I'd suggest you grab it at the first opportunity.

3	I'm glad I did!

3	Excellent review!

3	This looks like a very nice piece of LEGO-enginereing *y*!

3	Like you I think it looks like the original.

3	I did think though that it was supposed to be a un-armed ship but I can defenitly live with that X-D!

3	The escape shuttle looks roamy enough, a bit dull though but it could have a PS III stached away somewhere, but the other shuttle :-| - come on!

3	Is it for Mini-me when he needs to go and get some burgers & fries?

3	Getting at least two On copmike

3	Thanks for the review!

3	I'm glad to see Lego including details of everyday life, like the food (though a plate would have been nice).

2	Brick Miner, on Jul 31 2007, 07:46 PM, said: as for the set, the thing that jumps out at me most is the use of dark blue for water... im so used to seeing the classic blue for water, that the dark blue seems weird.

2	i don't like it.

2	- BM Indeed, I only noticed this when I saw the S@H images.

2	I guees that they're on dark waters.

2	You can always put some trans blue and trans clear 1x1 round plates, no?

2	I tried that technique to make the lava (using trans red and trans orange plates), it looks neat.

2	Regarding the human soldier thing Yoda mentioned, it's quite weird.

2	Like him, I'm going to swap the legs, so they're coherent with the soldiers from the other sets.

2	Third note: is it just me or did you attach the two black gate pieces too high?

2	Shakar

3	Nice review, I like the building/port the most mmm,dark blue plates *wub* Pity it is a Toys'r'us exclusive, In The Netherlands there are only Toys'r'usses in the greater cities.

2	Shakar, on Aug 1 2007, 01:34 PM, said: Third note: is it just me or did you attach the two black gate pieces too high?

2	Shakar No, I think this is correct.

2	The upper plate with clip for the door is a little high, on top of a dark gray 1x1 brick.

2	So if you want the door to operate well you have to place it like that.

2	I just put the clip under that brick, a very easy fix, so my door now is lower which looks better IMHO, and no sneaky skelly can crawl along under it.... X-D

3	Not sure I like this one much.

3	I like many of the new parts but the boat isn't that great and I would rather get each seperately so I can avoid the whole skeleton army.

3	Nice review though!

3	Asuka is correct.

3	Also keep in mind that the picture was taken looking down on the model that is sitting on the carpet.

3	It makes the gap appear a little larger.

3	In addition; for those of you that recommended ironing the sail, it worked great.

3	I set the iron to low and used a t-shirt to protect the sail.

3	It flattened it out perfectly.

3	In fact, it worked so well, that I did the same with my old WW Weapons Wagon cover that has gotten wrinkled over the years.

3	The iron worked perfectly.

3	Yes, that was definately an optic illusion.

3	Looking at it again, the gap looks a lot shorter.

3	Thanks.

3	:-) Shakar

3	Yes, very nice review Mr Brickster!

3	I think I , for a change, like the castle part better.

3	The ship doesn't look quite right to me.

3	If they're gonna make a pirate theme with ships like this I wouldn't be very happy...

3	But I think the ship brings some nice accesories.

3	Like the anchor, a black mid piece(!

3	), steering wheel etc.

3	I think I'll buy it eventually.

3	Thanks for the review Brickster!

3	It's great to be able to see more views of this set.

3	Ok here is the set alot of us star wars fans have been waiting for!

3	The 7666 Hoth Rebel Base!

3	*wub* First the box Now the great minifigs!

3	That stunning K-3po fig!

3	Now the snowspeeder!

3	AAAAGGGHHHHH these parts are all stickers!

3	Now for the turret!

3	the 2 cones on the side press in to fire out 2 blue lights saber blades :-D Now for the small crane thingy.

3	Yes the part under the engine on the snowspeeder is another sticker 8-| Echo Base!!

3	(well the front door anyway :-D ) The main control room?

3	:-D Again these are stickers on a tinted clear panel and on the slope |-/ I have no idea what this is meant to be!

3	:-D Finally 2 shots of the full set!

3	*wub* Well over all i really like this set and think it is great value for money.

3	The minifigs alone would set you back more than the cost of this set.

3	The build time was a good 2 hours or so and was good fun!

3	The snowspeeder is not as good as the second snowspeeder and no where near as good as the first in my opinion, but i did love that first one.

3	The k-3po fig is perfect and it is good to be getting more droids that aren't r2-d2 and c-3po.

3	It is a shame about the stickers but that is the price of keeping the cost down i suppose (the only printed part in the whole set is the snowspeeder/x-wing windscreen).

3	I will definately be getting atleast another 3 of this great set.

3	9/10

3	I love it.... depending on the Australian price!

3	(If it comes down here that is.)

3	Incidently, I have no idea what that other yellow thing is either!

3	Thanks for the review.

3	Thanks for the review!

3	A very good review, thanks mutley777!

3	*y* Hmm, that shattered base looks better than I thought.... a very playable set, really nice.

3	For the Snowspeeder, I prefer the main gun design of its predecessor, but the grappling hook gun is a good improvement.

3	If the door would just be large enough for it.... :-P

3	don't worry guys, the snowspeeder fits through the door easily :-)

2	Mutley , did you bought it @ TRU?

2	- Are there any other sets?

2	exept of Hoth Base , and is there the republic cruiser?

1	I thought after the King's Royal Castle uproar about stickers, Lego would have gone back to printed bricks.

3	There was a girl unpacking sets and saying to me, oh this ones just come in and this one :-D (showing me the republic cruiser, MTT, Jedi with hyperdrive ring, naboo star fighter and the hoth base) I had to leave, or that would have ended up one very expensive morning :-D

3	WoW!!

3	Why didnt you bought 3 of them :-D?

3	Wow, I didn't think we'd get a review so fast 8-?

3	Really nice review, the pictures explain it all *y* :-) I really hope to get this set as it is really great...

3	I guess :-D

2	?40 I think.

3	Very reasonable *y* not too bad ... might have to pick that up soon then, I will be in TRU in Southampton over the weekend ;) I think I'll buy the bigger sets here and get the smaller ones in the USA later in the year.

3	The smaller the boxes, the more chance I will have getting them in my suitcase ;) I have to say, I am very glad we are now not getting a 1:1 ratio between the numbers used prices in USA vs UK (e.g.

3	it is not longer ?49.99 = $49.99) :)

3	Excellent set.

3	The snowtroopers are just amazing (most Lego imperial troops are really good).

3	However, it's sad that except from Luke, all the rebels have the same face which is what is more the most unexpressive that you can find.

3	For the rest, the quality looks excellent.

3	The snowspeeder is far better than the first they realized (but only one thing: it looks a bit too white to me.

3	I think I remember they were grey and orange rather than white in the film) and the Echo Base door is really cool.

3	Really nice set.

3	Nice review mutley *y*!

3	I agree with all your observations, especially stickers versus printed parts |-/!

3	I get some of this and replace the snowspeeders with my v.2?s.

3	Hoth On copmike

3	Great review - NOW I WANT IT EVEN MORE!

3	?40???

3	That sounds reasonable in comparison to our recent experiences!

3	THe Bi-wing baron or this!

3	And it's quoted because it says LIMITED EDITION?!?!?!

3	I may never get this set now :'-(

1	Man the stickers on everything are really starting to irritate me a lot.

1	I'm not sure I like the white 3P0, in a set that is primarily made up of whites.

1	Doesn't stand out enough.

1	The snowspeeder looks a lot shorter than previous versions.

2	REVIEW - 42039 - 24 HOURS RACE CAR INTRODUCTION When the preliminary images of the "Le Mans Racer" surfaced somewhere last year (2014) it got a lot of praise.

2	This changed dramatically when the final images of the 24 Hours Race Car showed up.

2	The front side of the car, especially the head lights, and the curvature of the side of car had changed a lot.

2	The car obviously still resembled the prototype, but the new design raised a lot of eyebrows.

2	The new design was considered a step back instead of forward.

2	Eventhough I still liked the design, I must admit I liked the earlier design better too.

2	With the emphasis on past tense liked.

2	I am not sure anymore and this review will show you why.

2	Like the Arctic Truck this set has a B-model which is well worth checking out.

2	That's why this review includes both the A-model and B-model.

2	For people who are on the fence, the B-model might actually convince them to buy the set after all.

2	Let's see what this set is all about!

2	Note: All images can be clicked for hi-res versions.

2	SET INFORMATION Number: 42039 Title: 24 Hours Race Car Theme: Technic Released: 2015 Part Count: 1219 Box Weight: 2110 gr Box Dimensions: 47,8 cm x 37,3 cm x 8,7 cm Model Dimensions: 40 cm x 18 cm Set Price (MSRP): €99.99 / $?

2	/ £99.99 Price per Part: €0.082 / $?

2	/ £0.082 Links: Brickset, Bricklink THE BOX The box measures 47,8 cm x 37,3 cm x 8,7 cm and weighs well over 2kg (2110 gr to be precise).

2	The width of the box is the same as the box of the Arctic Truck.

2	This box also feels like it's filled to the brim.

2	THE FRONT The front shows a picture of the main model in action, with radial blurred wheels to emphasize the motion of the car.

2	The lower right section shows the dimensions of the model.

2	Upon completion, it will measure a length of 40cm and a width of 18 cm.

2	THE BACK Like the front, the back side has exactly the same setup as the box of the Arctic Truck.

2	The top shows the functions of the model, while the lower left side shows the B-model and the lower right side shows the motorization options.

2	The picture of the B-model looks so cool, it could be a model of it's own.

2	At this point I was very eager to build both models and compare them.

2	THE SIDE One of the sides usually shows a part in 1:1 scale.

2	This time it's one of the wheels indicating the size of the model.

2	CONTENT OF THE BOX The box contains: 1 Book(let) 1 Sticker Sheet 13 Bags 4 Tires INSTRUCTION BOOKLET Since I own two copies of the set, I also received two instruction booklets.

2	What's catching my eye is that my second copy is supplied in different packaging than the first one.

2	It's for the first time (that I am aware of) that the instruction booklet and stickers come in a sealed bag, without cardboard back.

2	Hopefully this will be a new standard for all sets with sticker sheets.

2	Instead of multiple booklets, this set contains a single square bound book.

2	In earlier reviews I have epxressed my preference for a single book.

2	I don't see any advantage in having 2, 3 or even up to 6 booklets.

2	STICKER SHEET Like the actual model, the sticker sheet looks very vibrant.

2	The bright green, white and black color combination has found it's way to the stickers as well.

2	Either you love 'em or hate 'em.

2	Since I started writing reviews I have been applying stickers and I am happy I started doing it.

2	Stickers do give the model it's finishing touch.

2	BAGS WITH PARTS Thirteen bags with a total of 1219 parts (give or take a few) are supplied in the densily packed box.

2	The rims and flex are sealed in a bag as well.

2	Sometimes looking at the bags makes you wonder what the logic is, behind the distribution of the various parts across the different bags.

2	Well this time it really got me confused.

2	Take a look at two of the bags below.

2	There's a bag containing all the 3L Blue Pins.

2	Then there's a bag with various parts....and a single 3L Blue Pin.

2	I figured this might be an error, but both of the sets have the same anomaly.

2	TIRES The tires have been supplied unbagged, as usual.

2	HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This chapter describes new and interesting parts.

2	This set actually contains a lot of them.

2	This set also contains an abundance of panels.

2	If you aren't into panels, this isn't the set for you.

2	CHANGEOVER CATCH This year (2015) the new changeover catch parts were released.

2	It's a combination of three parts.

2	The advantage of the new parts is that the red gear is the same on both sides, which avoids mounting it the wrong way around.

2	It also avoids the changeover catch slipping out of the driving ring, like it used to do.

2	You can apply lots of pressure, but the catch doesn't slip out.

2	PINS Some of last year's new pins are also included in this set.

2	12 x Pin with Pin Hole and 21 x 3L Pin with 1L Axle.

2	Securing Technic Beams can be quite simple with the new Pin with Pin Holes.

2	The new 3L Pin with 1L Axle gives you more possibilities when connecting Beams and other parts.

2	Below are two example situations where the new pins have been used.

2	Granted, the examples below can be accomplished by using other techniques.

2	However, some predicaments from the past can be easily solved by using these new parts.

2	Like me, you will most likely appreciate the ease of use.

2	ENGINE AND SUSPENSION Also included are two Steering Portal Hubs and Steering Portal Hubs with Ball Joint Arms and four Steering Portal Axles for driving and steering the vehicle.

2	These parts are commonly used nowadays.

2	The picture below also shows some other parts, like gear rack, steering arms and suspension.

2	FRAMES This set comes with a single 5x7 Frame and three 5x11 Frames.

2	PANELS This set contains a whopping 47 panels in three different colors.

2	I personally like panels a lot and I do appreciate the variety we have at our disposal lately.

2	This set even contains a new 13x3x2 Curved "Mudguard" Panel.

2	NEW 13x3x2 CURVED PANEL This is the first set to contain the new 13x3x2 Curved Panel.

2	Looking at the pictures doesn't do these panels justice.

2	In real life they are actually quite big.

2	I figured they would be smaller, but they are even longer than the 11 x 5 frame, with a length of 13 (including the attachment points).

2	Hopefully this part will be available in other colors as well, preferably white, for adding variety to your EV3 robot.

2	19L WHITE FLEX-AXLES The White 19L Flex Axles have only been released in a single set, the 8461 Williams F1 Racer in 2002.

2	Current prices on Bricklink are as high as 15 Euros!

2	Needless to say we are very happy with the return of these White Axles.

2	Now we can build Jeroen Ottens' awesome Alfa Romeo 4C Spider for a decent price as well.

2	I am really happy that useful rare parts are being used more often by TLG designers PART LIST Here's the complete list for all 1219 parts.

2	As you can see in the Highlighted parts section, this set contains a lot of interesting and useful parts.

2	If you don't own sets like the 8070 - Supercar, this might be the set to pick up if you want to start building your own supercar.

2	THE BUILD Enough with all the set and part information, let's build the model.

2	REAR SUSPENSION The build starts with the rear suspension and drivetrain.

2	As you can see in the picture below, the length of the Axle between the Steering CV Joint is 4L, where it usally is 3L.

2	This is an indication that the finished model will be a bit bigger than usual (8070 for example).

2	The finished suspension is one of the cleanest suspension setups I have seen in an official model.

2	It's pretty basic, but it works like a charm.

2	This setup is defintely worth using in your MOC.

2	Here's a video: After attaching the suspension to the frame you rotate the module and secure it.

2	At this stage the rear section of the chassis with suspension is almost finished.

2	V8 MID-ENGINE Extending the chassis forward results in the picture below, where the front spoiler is already visible.

2	What's also visible is the V8 engine placed right in front of the rear axle, resulting in a Mid-engine setup, perfectly suited for sports and race cars.

2	Two exhaust pipes have been fitted on either side of the engine, together with two hoses attaching them to the engine.

2	The instructions are easy to follow, although you sometimes you need to bend the beams a bit.

2	Minor improvements are possible here and there, but nothing shocking.

2	FRONT SUSPENSION The front suspension is a bit more complicated than the rear suspension, which makes sense considering the fact it contains the steering rack.

2	The shock absorbers are placed in a different angle than the rear ones, resulting in a somewhat stiffer front suspension.

2	All in all the front suspension is well designed and the steering rack can be easily powered with a Servo Motor.

2	The picture belows shows the front suspension attached to the chassis.

2	If you follow the official instructions to motorize the model, the area in front of the suspension is used to mount the battery box.

2	When you are modding this model to make it Full RC this area can be used to mount the servo motor.

2	GEARBOX Like the gearbox in the 8070, it's not used to switch gears powering the drivetrain.

2	It's used to switch between two functions, opening the doors and the hood/bonnet.

2	The gearbox is located at the left of the vehicle, near the cockpit.

2	The mechanism to open the doors is located on the left side, while opening the hood/bonnet is taking place at the right side.

2	To accomplish this, some axles traverse under the cockpit to the other side of the vehicle.

2	Following the axles to other side of the vehicle and adding some gears, results in the situation below.

2	The video below shows the gearbox in action.

2	DOOR OPENING MECHANISM The mechanism to open the door is comprised of some Knob Wheels, Links without Stoppers and Pins with Towballs.

2	Take a look at the doors opening and closing.

2	THE FRONT Using the new mudguards and various other panels you finish the front of the car.

2	The front is probably the most controversial part of the car.

2	This is caused by the preliminary pictures shown before the release of this car.

2	In the early pictures the front of the car had smooth curves and beautiful lines, while the final car lost these smooth lines and got a more blocky look in return.

2	I must admit that at a first glance, the new design lost some of it's appeal.

2	However, this model grew on me pretty rapidly.

2	The headlight design can be found, in more or less the same way, on several real Le Mans type race cars.

2	THE REAR The rear of the car looks great, with the stickers continuing from the mudguards to the panels underneath the spoiler.

2	The two exhausts sticking out give some details to the back.

2	I absolutely disagree with all the negativity surrounding this car.

2	Maybe it's one of those models which needs to grow on you.

2	FINISHED MODEL Here it is, the finished model.

2	I know some of you don't like the looks of the car, but I think it looks great.

2	The color scheme is outstanding.

2	The new (for Technic) bright green parts, combined with white and black make this car look very vibrant and colorful.

2	I am not a big fan of the green used in the 42008 - Service Truck, but I do like this bright green a lot.

2	It fits perfectly well with the Mindstorms EV3 set.

2	The curves on the side of the car are not as smooth as some of us hoped, but I still think the car looks more than acceptable from the side.

2	The stickers add some nice details to the car, giving it that characteristic race car look.

2	The model looks great in pictures, but it does even look better in real life.

2	I love this picture of the front of the car.

2	However, I do wonder if a dedicated 24 hour Le Mans Racer has the seat and steering positioned off-center?!

2	Using the good ol' Google Machine I come to the conclusion that they do have centered seating and steering, at least the majority of them.

2	There's ample space in the cabin, which makes me wonder why TLG decided to place the seat off-centered.

2	The rear view looks cool too, with some of the suspension showing and the two exhaust pipes clearly visible.

2	The bottom view is very useful to determine the size of the car in studs.

2	It measures approx 59 x 27 studs.

2	The chassis looks organized and well designed.

2	The engine has been placed close to the ground, which is perfect for the weight distribution.

2	A low center of gravity improves the handling of the car.

2	I really enjoyed building this baby.

2	The build is very clean and organized, although there are some steps where you need to bend the beams a bit to get things into place.

2	Seeing the model come to life and seeing it grow to pretty impressive proportions is very satisfying.

2	For me it was fun, but I reckon kids will go nuts over this set and the build.

2	SIZE COMPARISON What became obvious during the build, but what's emphasized when you have finished the model, is that it's quite big!

2	The size of the car is pretty impressive.

2	The pictures below show the car next to the 42030 - Volvo L350F.

2	The side view emphasizes the size of the car.

2	It's even longer than the Volvo, if you dismiss the bucket.

2	PARTS LEFT Some parts left.

2	Nothing out of the ordinary.

2	FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS Unlike the B-model, this model doesn't implement any unexpected features.

2	The functions it does implement are exactly what you would expect from any car.

2	Steering (HoG) Working fake engine Suspension Opening doors (gullwing style) Opening bonnet/hood Opening trunk Gearbox for switching between functions Unfortunately the steering wheel hasn't been linked to the HoG (Hand of God) steering mechanism.

2	Placing the seat in the center would have provided an easy way to link the steering wheel to the steering mechanism.

2	it's a shame we hardly see actual steering anymore.

2	Opening the hood actually opens up the entire rear section of the car, providing you with easy access to the motor compartment.

2	The mechanism to open the hood works properly, which results in smooth opening and closing of it.

2	The same goes for the gullwing style doors.

2	Both functions are operated manually and you need to switch with the lever to the left of the cockpit.

2	These two functions are also the ones which can be motorized by placing an M-motor near the cockpit and a battery box in the trunk.

2	All things considered I think this car offers lots of playability.

2	The model is solidly built and the functions are easy to operate.

2	I'd say it's pretty safe to let your kids play with it.

2	B-MODEL Unlike the A-model, the B-model for this set received (almost) universal acclaim, and I can see why.

2	Often the B-model is a pale shadow of it's part donor.

2	In this case the model looks so good, it could be a model of it's own.

2	It even incorporates a neat feature, which actually deserves to be in the A-model.

2	There's a lot a variation in the quality of digital building instructions TLG is providing, but these ones are of very high quality.

2	The picture below shows most of the chassis with suspension, fake engine and gearbox in place.

2	FINISHED MODEL Some concessions have been made, but overall the car looks fantastic.

2	The black of the roof has been extrapolated from the hood, which definitely works for me.

2	The rear section of the car feels a bit empty, but the panels do cover up most of it, so it's hardly noticeable.

2	The V8 stickers will be upside down if you use the parts from the A-model.

2	Since I could apply new stickers, I have placed them using the proper orientation.

2	The bottom of the car shows the chassis.

2	It's obviously a bit smaller than the A-model's chassis.

2	FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS Taking the functions into account, this model isn't playing second fiddle to the A-model.

2	Besides the obvious functions like steering, opening doors and hood, this car features folding fog lights, which deserve a better podium than a B-model.

2	Steering (Hog) Working fake engine Suspension Opening doors (manually) Opening hood/bonnet (manually) Opening trunk (operated by gear) Folding fog lights (operated by gear) Gearbox (used to switch functions) FOG LIGHTS One of the most interesting features of the B-model are the folding Fog Lights.

2	It almost feels a bit weird that a feature like this is implemented in the B-model, instead of the A-model.

2	Below are 4 steps showing how the mechanism works.

2	I have also included a video.

2	The mechanism is somewhat reminiscent of fork mechanism used in the 8109 - Flatbed Truck, which has been described in Efferman's Review.

2	Take a look at the video to the fog lights in action.

2	PARTS LEFT A fair number of parts left, which isn't uncommon for a B-model.

2	SUMMARY To summarize how I feel about this set, you need to take a look at the picture below.

2	The combined image reflects the quality of this set....or better yet....sets!

2	You actually get two great models, for the price of one.

2	You don't like the A-model?

2	No problem, you can have lots of fun with the B-model.

2	I can't stop playing with the fog lights, it's mesmarizing.

2	The color scheme on both models is outstanding.

2	I simply can't emphasize enough how well this color scheme pleases the eye.

2	The regular green is dull and boring, but this bright green really pops out, especially when combined with black and white, and possibly some red details.

2	Black, white and a little red?!

2	Sounds familiar?

2	Yes, bright green can easily be combined with your EV3 robots.

2	So while you are combining the bright green with your robot, why not use the great new curved "mudguard" panels.

2	These new panels are introduced in this set and they look great.

2	They open up a lot of possibilities in the design department.

2	The build of the A-model is outstanding.

2	It is fairly simple, but since it's so clean, I really enjoyed it a lot.

2	I think the build should be entertaining, which doesn't mean it needs to be a real challenge.

2	And let's be honest; when is a build really challenging?!

2	The rear suspension is a good example of why I liked the build.

2	It's very simple, yet very effective.

2	Works like a charm.

2	The same goes for the other functions in both models.

2	And the star of the entire show can be found in the B-model.

2	How's that for a surprise?!

2	Being aware of the fact that I like this model a lot better than most of you seem to do, I really encourage you to give this model a chance.

2	The sheer size is impressive, the color scheme is awesome and you get a bonus model, which is actually worth building.

2	SCORE Okay, so how do I grade this set?

2	8 DESIGN Open to debate, but I like it a lot.

2	8 BUILDING EXPERIENCE Fun and clean build.

2	9 FEATURES Superb function in B-model steels the show.

2	9 PLAYABILITY Both models offer lots of playability 8 PARTS Lots of new parts and cool existing parts.

2	10 VALUE FOR MONEY Two models for the price of one.

2	8,7 TWICE THE FUN I hope you enjoyed this review!

2	More pictures can be found on my Flickr page.

3	Outstanding review Jim, congrats !

3	Love the pictures, so clean and crisp .

3	Hope to see many more of your reviews.

3	As for the set, after seeing this review I kind of like it, if I will find it at a decent price, I will get it for sure.

3	Jim, great review as always.

3	You convinced me to get this one of these days, although not a to priority.

3	Any comments on which functions can be converted to PF and how well they work?

3	Any comments on which functions can be converted to PF and how well they work?

3	Actually yes!

3	I am in the midst of making a PF version.

3	I will post a picture of the setup I have so far.

3	This setup is for driving the chassis and it works pretty fine!

3	Thanks for a great review.

3	I've got a pile of TRU and Lego credit I wanna spend and was thinking about getting this (since I got a sneak peak of your review in the Academy) but it's not here in the US yet.

3	Too bad.

3	Wonder when it'll hit?

3	I do disagree about the manuals though.

3	I find the thinner, stapled manuals easier to use than single large square-bound ones since they lay flatter when open.

3	Have any links to the prelim photos of the front end?

3	I don't remember seeing that and was curious how different it looked.

2	Can't argue with that.

2	I don't remember seeing that and was curious how different it looked.

2	i must have it somewhere.

3	Great review,I am still undecided whether to get this set or not.

3	Really thorough review, Jim.

3	I am super jealous that you have 2 of these and I have none, with no opportunity to get one any time soon.

3	Great review.

3	I see now why the B model is so popular.

3	I wonder though, on the car, if instead of the panels for the rear spolier (or wing) if they could have used studded panels and maybe layer them to give the appearance of, ie: a three element rear wing.

3	I won't mention the front lights.

3	If I had the money I would buy it for the B model.

3	H

3	Great review Jim and stunning pictures

3	I think this set will be my next purchase.

3	I love the color scheme and indeed it looks like a nice set.

3	Also 1200 parts for EUR 100 is not a bad deal.

3	And yes, the looks of the car have really grown on my since the first official pictures appeared.

3	I'm curious how the bright green will work combined with other colors than white.

3	I really hope more sets in the future will use the color (so that more different parts will be available over time).

3	I think I'm the only person on Eurobricks who doesn't like the looks of the B model, but I appreciate the extra functionality it offers.

3	Besides the set itself, I think this is one of the best reviews I have read in a while.

3	Great job on the superb photographs (which I think are essential to a review) and the extensiveness of it all.

3	You really touched every subject, which is great :D

2	I think I read somewhere that the US will not get this set or the motorcycle until August 2015.

2	That means the flagship most likely won't be in August but even later in the year... nothing Bricklink can't solve though.

3	Fantastic review Jim, from the quality of the review alone it is easy to see how much hard work you have put into it.

3	I'm with you on the instruction manual, I much prefer one quality bound book over umpteen stapled booklets.

3	Already have 2 of these sitting in the build queue, one for display model as I'm a fan of this one and one to build the B model then dissemble for parts, so I'm already sold on his set but still very much enjoyed taking the time it deserves to read through the review and ogle at your pro photography.

3	Great review with fantastic pictures.

3	As for the model, I'm glad that they chose to make it less pretty - real Le Mans prototypes are rarely a sight to behold.

3	It is function and aerodynamics over form.

3	I would, however, have preferred more realism for the sake of learning: - The front shouldn't open like that - instead it should be easy to remove the whole front cover, leaving the suspension easy to work on.

3	- The aero seems to be realistic, except for the rear end where there's no indication of a venturi channel.

3	This should have been easy to include.

3	- There is no fuel tank, nor fixed fuel connector right behind the cabin.

3	- There are no air jacks!

3	Seriously!?

3	This is one of the most unique features of a race car like this... and LEGO forgot about them.

3	Instead they automated two functions which are manual on a real race car.

3	- The top cars at Le Mans are hybrids with ingenious systems.

3	I would have loved to see the front wheels connected to some kind of spinning apparatus indicating a kinetic energy recovery system.

3	If I get this set...

3	I'm going to make some modifications.

3	This is a mega review.

3	You've taken the right pictures and the video demonstrations of the mechanisms really help get the good points of the set across.

3	What's more amazing is that the review still feels very concise and to the point.

3	You've actually convinced me to put this set on my list and not just as a decent parts pack.

3	I'm not sure air jacks are the feature that will have people fawning over this set, and pneumatics are being covered rather well later in the year ... but I agree with everything else, most notably removable front and rear bodywork (the removable engine cover on 8674 would be a good starting point here) and the inclusion of some nod towards a hybrid system.

3	It's also worth remembering the preliminary design did have the Big Honking Fin (BHF) that is mandatory on all current prototypes, so maybe when that was removed any trace of a tunnel or diffuser went with it.

3	On the subject of steering wheels, all modern prototypes actually have left or right hand drive.

3	The regulations demand that both LMP1 and LMP2 cars are nominally capable of seating two people.

3	Of course in practise the "extra seat" is taken up by the hybrid system in LMP1 and electronics/extra cockpit access in LMP2.

3	However this doesn't change the fact that it would be easy to link the steering wheel to the HoG/front axle.

3	I was very skeptical of this set because I really thought the redesign degraded the looks of the A-model a lot, but after building it I must say this is an excellent set.

3	Good job TLG!

3	I'm still not a huge fan of the model, but this is one awesome review.

3	The effort and quality can be clearly seen and I hope you continue making reviews like this

3	Ted, have you described your photography setup somewhere?

3	I love the crisp quality of your pictures.

3	Great review.

3	I think it look like a great set, both A and B.

3	However the panels are the only thing I would need, but still a great looking set.

3	Great review Jim..

3	I have been sitting on the fence about if I will get this set for a while but I saw one built for the first time at a local brick show on the weekend.

3	It definitely looks better in real life than any pics.

3	I have decided to buy one

3	A very professional review and really no stone unturned.

3	But I'm still not going to rush out and buy a copy

2	Awesome review Jim!

2	I love the pictures.

2	I don't like how LEGO did this model though.

2	Too many compromises Edited by Omikron, 13 March 2015 - 07:24 AM.

3	A great review Jim.

3	Just finished building this set.

3	A couple of steps required abit of lego stressing to get together when there was an easier way.

3	Just made it into RC ( almost finished it in LDD) which was easy to do as it has so much room for nearly any configuration of motors and not have them showing.

3	A great set.

2	Wonderful review, but I am still not sold on the set.

2	If we get more sets with the bright green I might be tempted to get it, but until then it is too few parts in bright green (too few different types, not the number of pieces) to be able to use that colour effectively in making MOC's.

3	True, but I must say I like the new colour, very 'fresh' looking compared to the rather dullish regular green.

3	Can't wait to build MOCs with it.

3	I have been waiting for this set since the pictures for the toy fairs eirlier in the year and I am glad to say I am not disapointed.

3	First the price it is not cheap at ?99.99 but I guess that is typical for a set with this amount of electronics in it.There is no parts count and I have not had time to add up the 2 pages of contents to get a figure.

3	First the box standard flip top with large internal picture and rip to open lid.

3	inside There are no numbered bags in this set which I prefer I like to open all the bags and put all the parts in the box before building.

3	Next is a picture on the electronics 2 XLmotors as lego describe them and 2 standard motors.

3	2 IR receivers and 1 IR transmitter I know these have been discussed before but I really like the thought that has gone into the transmitters/receivers each receiver has 2 outputs to corespond with the 2 controls on transmitter they also have a choice of 4 channels so one transmitter can control up to 8 independant motors by changing the channel switch.

3	The transmitter also has a neat motor direction switch so you can configure the transmitter operation.

3	The set comes with three manuals 1 is the main drive mechanism 2 is the cab and engine and 3 is the attachments front and back.

3	There is also the now standard parts list in the back of the third manual.

3	There is no alternative model instructions despite the pictures of one on the box however there is a reference to the technic website on the back of the box but at the moment the page only has an advert saying the set is to be released on 1st September so I guess I will have to wait untill then to see if the instructions will be online.

3	The build is fairly straight forward the main chassis is studless, the next picture shows the motors mounted into the chassis and the drive for the shovel and claw.

3	It also shows the V6 technic engine.

3	This next picture shows the IR receivers mounted on the back.

3	The battery box slots into the back and can be easily slid out with the removal of two pins which is useful because I can imagine I will need to change the batteries on a regular basis.

3	The next 2 picture are of the completed model Overall I was very happy with the finished dozer the functions work really well and as I have the monster dino I have used a second transmitter so I dont have to touch the channel switch, I have included some video On my Brickshelf page.

3	Unfortunately this set does suffer from some quality issues for example moulding marks on the plates, colour diferences, some of the pins not finished properly, some pins were very stiff and quite hard to push into the holes but the worst issue was an axle that would not turn freely in a hole which just adds extra friction into the system.

3	I am glad to see some studded technic in this set I much prefer sets that use both varieties of technic beam.

3	There are only 2 Fairings which is a great improvment over recent sets if TLC had tried to make the bulldozer shovel with fairings this would have been a complete disaster.

3	Marks for the set 8/10 for price with the number of motors I expected it to be greater.

3	9/10 for fun my kids love this type of set that does something when finished.

3	6/10 for quality TLC really need to work on this one.

3	8/10 overall I would definately get a second one if I see it in the sales.

3	Feel free to post questions but I will be on holiday next week.

3	More pics and Videos available HERE

3	Thank you vey much for this review.

3	I do have some questions; 1.

3	What are the white clutches geared into?

3	2.

3	Is the engine geared to one or both drive motors?

3	3.

3	How well does it go on carpet?

3	4.

3	Can it doze without breaking the blade?

2	Not sure if is fairly strong I have only chased the cat at the moment :'-(

3	Excellent review, thanks!

3	What is the cost in US?

3	Not released in my area.

3	The shovel is obviously my favorite area, it looks detailed and strong.

3	I love the treads, because I need them to move the 4 x 4 barrels on my super-scaled turbolaser turret.

3	Very good pics too.

3	What color are the treads?

3	I never had them.

3	They are plastic or rubber?

2	Ah man...I wanted to review it with mine.

2	Oh well.

2	Here in the U.S. it cost $150 and has 1355 pieces total.

2	The pins and axles did seem a bit difficult in putting them into place.

2	A problem I have been having is the batterys are done after about 4 hours of play, which I really wish they would last longer :-( .

2	Overall it is a stupendous set and it is really nice to see our old friend the studs make a return!

3	Where??

3	I'm really liking this set!

3	Its looking better now that i'm seeing more of it at differnt angles.

3	I'mvery curious how wellit pulls, and and can push/doze before the clutches start slipping.

2	Thanks for the review, it really looks cool.

2	Too bad it's soo expensive.

2	:-/ I must admit that I prefer the 8421 mobile crane for more or less the same price, the design is more "sexy".

2	*wub*

3	Thanks for the great review of this set.

3	I've been looking forward to it as well and I am excited about the wireless controls like the Dino.

3	I too am curious if this set has been released here in the US.

3	I was told that it was a Sept 1 release.

3	I agree about the battery life.

3	My Dino set lasted about 4 hours too.

3	Thanks for the review!

3	This looks like a great set, and with four motors, two receivers and a remote control I wouldn't say it is overpriced.

3	It is still a lot of money though.....

3	If my scholarship permits it I will seriously consider buying this set.

3	I can't wait to get my paws on this dozer!

3	:-$ The new motors look very interesting and I It will be fun to see which possibilities they have in any future MOC:s.

3	Thank you very much for that neat review, Ickelpete!

3	*y* Your pictures?re very interesting and your video?s really good.

3	That set looks very beautiful to me, a formidable new Technic set that quickly?ll turn into an everlasting classic for sure.

3	:'-) I?m just a little sorry for those quality problems.... Well, I hope that TLC?ll work on that matter and fix it soon.

3	The clutches are only for the shovel and claw on the front and back the tracks are driven directly from the XL motors and first impressions are good they seem quite powerful it will climb over a small cusion quite easily.

3	Nice review, Ickelpete.

3	Thank you.

3	Ickel, thanks for that awesome review.

3	It makes me want to buy this set.

3	I think it'd go just swell with the Mobile Crane.

3	The fact that it has all the motors and such is awesome, I can foresee using those for a lot of other functions for MOCs.

3	And, well I'm a fan of treads.

3	You can never have enough treads :-D Hm, would you be able to tell us, perhaps after a test or two what kind of weight this beast can push around?

3	Thank you!

3	Hi, many thanks for this review, photos and videos.

3	I can't wait to put the hands on mine, since it is already ordered and should arrive before the end of the month.

3	:'-) Could you post a scan or photos, from those last pages in the Building Instructions where the parts included are listed?

3	Thanks Edited by Conchas, 04 August 2007 - 07:19 PM.

2	*sing* I just noticed that he has done that in Brick journal 8.

2	Check out page 56-61 for great info and a comparison to the gear motors.

2	To bad it didn't include the NXT-motors since they are very similar.

3	Thank you Ickelpete for that great review.

3	I give you two *y* up.

3	I am not a technic fan, but this set definitly looks *sweet* .

3	I see great potential using this set as a model for a smaller dozer for my town/train layout.

3	I really *wub* the crawler tracks they used.

3	I have been thinking about buying the snowmobile for the tracks.

3	But if possible, I just might buy this set instead.

3	I could definitly use the other parts for MOC's.

3	Model On!

2	When i read this i first though you meant set number but this model can't be found there yet and now i realize that you mean something completly different.

2	What is this code you're after?

2	What is this code you're after?

2	There is a additional code in the booklet (different for every one) you should find it from the front or back cover.

2	Also later editions have different codes.

2	Some examples: Set 7905 - 4497674 (Front Cover, Bottom Left) Set 8421 - 4284910 (Book 1) and 4284922 (Book 2) (Back Cover, Bottom Right) I'll bet the code is then used to "abuse" the Lego cache :-) Mig

3	The new small Technic sets have incredible functionality for their size, and this one is no exception.

3	With only 106 parts this crane can roll, extend, rotate, lift (and hold in any position) and has working stabilisers!

3	The boom extends the same as the other sets with this boom; simply pull it.

3	It works surprisingly well and due to circular ridges inside the boom the extension (which is just a standard beam) will hold in place.

3	The gear at the back controls the height of the boom.

3	As you can see the boom is only half extended.

3	Boom fully extended, half down.

3	The cable is kept in place via two gears and a blue pin, same as the 7905 crane.

3	Even under decent weights this works well.

3	The stabilisers however cannot handle much weight once the load is moved off axis.

3	The stablilsers are a very simple but effective design.

3	Another shot of the stablilsers.

3	This also shows how far the boom will decend.

3	The boom height mechanism works well also.

3	I love the cab design.

3	Overall this is a remarkable achievement for the low price.

3	I bought it for the boom piece as I want to improve the crane that came with 7998 7898 ( :-$ ).

3	I highly recommend it.

1	Very nice review Sinner!

1	*y* *wub* So we are getting more and more reviews with figs in it, that?s great!

1	:'-) I actually wanted to skip this technic set, but your review made me think again.

1	I haven?t seen you posting a price, so I will do that for you :-P : It?s (just) 9,99?

1	in Germany.

3	Really awesome review!

3	I didn't think this set could be that great, but it looks very nice and seems quite cheap.

3	*wub*

3	A very nice review of a very good little set, thanks Sinner!

3	I'll be picking up this set for sure.

3	Probbly a few just for the parts.

3	But one question.

3	What Crane are you refering to that came with 7998?

3	That is the new heavy loader, and it didn't come with an any crane> 8-?

3	Sorry.

3	My mistake.

3	I meant 7898. :-$

3	Alright, so I usually do quick photo reviews when I get new sets.

3	That's what I'll do here, but there's quite a few photos, so I thought I might as well make its own review thread.

3	So, I got the Kwik-E-Mart by paying just2much on an early eBay copy.

3	I think it's worth it, as this week I'm gonna be super busy, so I was able to build it Saturday and stuff.

3	Here's my video review, I think it's one of my best: Well, let's get onto this photo review.

3	The set is $200 USD with a little over 2100 pieces.

3	The official release is April 15th for VIP members, May 1st for everyone else at LEGO Stores.

3	And, if you want full size pictures, check out my Flickr by clicking here.

3	The minifigures included are great.

3	You get three exclusive minifigures (one being a completely exclusive character- the first time LEGO has ever put an exclusive mould in a Direct to Consumer set), and you get three of the series most popular characters in their normal attire for those who missed out on the first Simpsons minifigures series.

3	The Kwik-E-Mart's exterior is loaded with lots of sticker details.

3	The only printed detail you'll see in the exterior is the dial pad in the phone booth, which has appeared in some other licensed themes since last year.

3	( ^^^ right here is there the store can be opened- a simple Technic pin and receiver keeps it in place and allows for opening and closing) The roof of the store includes the garden shown in the Paul McCartney episode.

3	The roof can be slided out/in once you open it with the hinge part.

3	Here's a look at the store with the roof removed.

3	The floors are a nice sand blue color, coming with 8x16 thin plates: And, for the interior, from the view of the store opened with the hinges at the back that I mentioned earlier: The left front corner, which includes some arcade machines of Bonestorm and Great White Hunter, an amazingly done Buzz cola soda machine, juice machine, the checkout counter, ect: The right front corner, with food aisles, freezers, and a frozen Jasper sticker: The back left corner, which includes some nice coffee kettle builds, the donut tray, hotdogs, ect: The right back corner, which has a door leading to a very small hallway that only has a mouse and cheese in it.

3	The hallway leads to the employees only door in the back, and it's very hard to get in the door way (not that there's anything to do inside there): Also included is Clancy's copcar, which fits three figures: Here's a look at the piece list in the instructions, click on each to be lead to an enlarged version of the pic: Also included are some awesome printed pieces, and two unprinted coffee cups!

3	Honestly, I think this set is perfect.

3	The price is fantastic, and has a great PPP ratio.

3	They really went above and beyond by including Snake in this set.

3	I honestly think it's better than the Simpsons House in terms of accuracy and the value here- so many cool pieces printed and in exclusive colors.

3	So, that's my quick picture review.

3	Hope you guys enjoyed, and I'd love to hear your thoughts!

3	Thanks 'j2g' for another review, one of my favourite parts of the set......the half eaten donut on the dashboard of the police car.

3	Brick On Review On 'j2g' !

3	Thanks for the review, your video was very well done, seeing those sticker sheets is daunting.

3	Thanks for the review.

3	I can't help but think the minifigures are the weak part of the set.

3	Snake and Apu are great but the rest....

3	I don't know.

3	They kinda redundant now.

3	They could at least give us new torso printing, like Homer wearing his jacket or Bart wearing his blue t-shirt or Marge wearing her coat.

3	Or, as I said in the discussion thread, I'd have included Jasper in CMF series 2 and a Frozen version here.

3	Overall, the set looks kinda smaller than what I thought.

3	(Snake's bag needed a $ symbol printed, because it looks like he is stealing gargabe ) Pretty good review overall

1	Thanks for all the feedback you guys!

1	I agree, but so many people were complaining about how The Simpsons House should have included the most common versions (mostly because the eyes or whatever), so I think LEGO played it safe and just included the normal versions.

1	It makes sense, since Series 1 is gone forever, and the common versions were in there, and this set is bound to be in stock for a very long time like the Death Star.

1	I never really agreed when people were complaining about the alternate eye prints personally, but I guess this is a good business choice based on previous feedback.

3	Hello everyone.

3	Excellent review!

3	English is not my native language, but I want to express my opinion.

3	Simpsons house was the first of its kind, and I can say without exaggeration that this is the most impressive set that I'm going (my collection http://brickset.com/sets/ownedby-celeb ).

3	I look at the video from the Kwik-e-Mart, and is difficult to say how good it is compared with the house.

3	The main disadvantages that I said to myself, is this: build the walls of the large panels, next is access to the roof (gray parts in front of the back door (I think they represent the stairs)) is not on the level with doors on the roof and when you open them, you can see the white block is openly trash, my points of view.

3	Boxes on the left of go to the store and powersauce box, i want see make real and not just a cube, f.e.

3	such as in the unreleased Star Wars set.

3	About minifigures, I fully agree with Robert8.

3	Two more of the same Homer, Marge and Bart?!

3	Personally, I put my set as a scene and all the replays minifigure are inside the house that was not identical characters next And also absolutely terrible Bart`s accessory This set is made parking for bikes and it looks very cool.

3	But damn, it is hoped to see the Bart or Lisa's bike, instead of useless balloons with paint.

3	The walls are made with convex inside panels, why so?

3	can anyone know?

3	have not seen any pictures with such walls in TV show.

3	Why did not they turn?

3	I personally really like how realized roof, but my brother says that it is terrible :) garden could do more in the series there were almost jungle I do not know how to be considered here, maybe anyone can express any opinion or idea?

3	I look at the Simpsons house, and then look at the photo of this e-Mart.

3	I can not understand, in the house we have a garage, two floors, cool floor, a lot of furniture, all the rooms and walls, collected from cubes, many additional accessories.

3	And where is all this detail here?

3	It looks much smaller (maybe even poorer).

3	If they still will release next year comic book store, it will be even less?

3	Of course it is difficult to estimate without seeing it live, we have it will be sold only in May.

3	At first sight it does not look so impressive as the house.

3	Can certainly the case in the limit on the amount of detail, but why it was impossible to add $ 50 to the cost and make Jasper, the more detailed the roof, the walls of the smaller elements, that it was not convex.

3	Sad.

3	Thanks all for attention.

3	LOL!

1	I have sooo mixed feeling about that...

1	I loved the Simpsons House (save for the terrible wall in the Homer and Marge's room), but this so far is inferior in almost every aspect.

1	The walls made of panels is a bummer.

1	I expect a D2C set to be better that this.

1	60+ stickers?

1	The same thing.

1	Same price for less bricks and smaller build then the house.

1	Strange coloured bricks on the outside wall (some ugly mix of yellow + tan) Panels again with their fronts facing towards the inside of the shop so we and up with those squares all around.

1	The walls are yellow, this was so nice, lost opportunity to make it in some other less common colour.

1	Then again the set overall looks is good.

1	The roof is a nice detail.

1	The shop looks actually like a real one, not just an approximation of one.

1	The roof tiles are in Dark Orange - we got new/rare colour here The car looks interesting to build (just like the pink one from the house) Lots of nice references to the show It's The Simpsons!

1	Definitely a must buy... but for a discounted price.

1	I'll try to find one with maybe damaged box or after-display copy.

3	looks great.

3	how does it compare to the house

3	Mestari, on 14 April 2015 - 01:15 PM, said: I have sooo mixed feeling about that...

3	I loved the Simpsons House (save for the terrible wall in the Homer and Marge's room), but this so far is inferior in almost every aspect.

3	The walls made of panels is a bummer.

3	I expect a D2C set to be better that this.

3	60+ stickers?

3	The same thing.

3	Same price for less bricks and smaller build then the house.

3	Strange coloured bricks on the outside wall (some ugly mix of yellow + tan) Agreed!

3	Glad my GF likes to do stickers!

3	60 yikes!

3	But looking at it now I think the tan/yellow is supposed to represent where the paint is fading on the back of the store?

3	I guess?

3	Here's a size comp to the house: Click for a bigger image.

1	That's actually not bad sizing, IMO.

1	Sure, it looks like you get a lot more with the house, but the Kwik-E-Mart has a lot more of those little references that make it Simpsons.

1	I agree with some of the complaining; a real Jasper behind a trans-blue panel would have been cool.

1	You could always bulk up the roof with more foliage...

1	I think it has a great foundation as a set, but could do with a few mods to make it better.

1	Thanks for the pictures; I greatly appreciate being able to see reviews like this before dropping $200 on a LEGO set.

3	Great Review Just2Good, honestly I love this set lots of great details and references.

1	One thing that may justify the price: it has 527 different parts (if I counted correctly).

1	I alway heard the more different parts the more difficult the set is to produce.

1	The Simpsons House already had an astonishig amount of different pieces, but this one is even more extreme...

1	just2good, on 12 April 2015 - 10:29 PM, said: ... one being a completely exclusive character- the first time LEGO has ever put an exclusive mould in a Direct to Consumer set ...

1	I'm still hoping that Snake will be coming in the next (wave 3) CMF set.

1	It's the level of detail that floors me, a licensed set with the mindset of those great Creator sets.

1	I think it displays much better than the Simpsons house which, from the outside, is a bit drab

1	Nice review!

1	But I have one question: Is the transparent dome of the Squishee Drink removable?

3	Skalldyr, on 15 April 2015 - 10:53 PM, said: Nice review!

3	But I have one question: Is the transparent dome of the Squishee Drink removable?

3	Nopers.

3	I like this set a lot better than the Simpsons house, but 60+ stickers is just incredibly disappointing.

3	It seems quite a few of them could have been printed parts

3	Great review.

3	Nice review, I'm building it (need to finish it, but I'm at work right now) With the printed piece, you forgot to show the chocolat milk 1x1 brick, which is exclusive to this set yet (it isn't referenced on bricklink yet, only the blue one) The set is really fun to build, with a lot of little pieces for the fridges.

3	I haven't put the stickers yet, will see the final product to put the essentials ones

3	Did anyone else have a problem with the piano against the wall of The Simpsons House?

3	It just kept coming off way too easily and I was getting really frustrated with it sticking out and not fully going on so I had to put the two tiles that hold them one place over away from the wall for it to sit properly without falling out, I think I might put Snowball II behind it since cats love to hide underneath or behind things lol but just curious to know if anyone else was encountering this problem with the previous set.

1	I recently acquired 90% of this set, so I thought I would do a review of it.

1	Please note that half of the Mini-figs are wrong, and there are some part substitutions.

1	This is the only set that comes with this plate.

1	There is a depression under the grey plates to the back.

1	The pool depression can be easily covered by three quarter circle plates... which just happen to be included in this set.

1	(Good set design Lego!)

1	The stairs are old Fabuland ones, and have been used in a few other sets.

1	This is the only one that has them in "ParaPink" however.

1	What is the difference between "ParaPink" and "Pink"?

1	Dunno...

1	The big windows are in only two other sets, both of them DACTA ones!

1	The smaller ones were in one other Paradisa set.

1	The interior, while simple, works very well.

1	I love the coffee machine.

1	A cute car came with the set as well.

1	The bird house is a nice idea as well.

1	Once the current visitors leave I will probably be breaking this set.

1	I wish Lego would go back to these sets as they always had some great parts in them.

3	Great review of a classic set.

3	*y*

3	Nice review of a surprisingly interesting set.

3	*y* Those windows are great, and no doubt difficult to get.

3	Classic coffee maker, simple yet exactly right.

3	That baseplate was in a few other sets, but never with that pattern.

3	Would have made a great base for some of the classic 80s houses LEGO used to treat us to.

3	In tan was part of the Adventurers Egypt sets.

3	As recently as 2001 it was a base for Ogel.

3	Versatile plate that hopefully hasn't disappeared completely.

3	ParaPink is apparently "Light Pink" on Brickshelf, so I guess it's just lighter than normal pink (and stopped appearing in 1995.

3	Just so you know, that monkey is drinking too much and likely to fall in the pool ... ;-)

3	I wouldn't mind one of all!

3	Many of the raised plates are too raised (I think the new one in the Police station and the Hospital is) but I think this one is perfect.

3	imperialshadows, on Aug 13 2007, 07:29 PM, said: Just so you know, that monkey is drinking too much and likely to fall in the pool ... ;-) I believe he is hoping to take the barman with him.

3	X-D (He is one of Hinckleys characters on holiday...)

3	Tks Sinner for that cool review ;-) This set is not one of my favs (never was really a big fan of those raised baseplates) but had fantastic parts and MFs !!

3	It has great playability with really cool "80's Miami" feel *wub* That pink was actually pretty cool and went well with that lime green (I think its lime but I'm not 100% positive).

3	Once again this pisses me off so much that I was in my dark ages when this theme was out !!

3	I loved it, especially all the beach/water themes *wub* I really wish TLC decided to bring that water Paradisia back !!

3	Who knows !!

3	After all they need to make some girlie sets !!

3	Girls are a part of their market totally neglected !!

3	How many women we have on the boards ??

3	Really a tiny few unfortunatly !!

3	SO TLC, please bring Paradisia back in may 08 :-P , please !!

3	*yoda*

3	I wouldn't be surprised if they do.

3	I think there is a greater chance of a return to Paradisia like sets than Fabuland.

3	I also think TLC is missing the mark with Belville.

3	I got that set recently as well.

3	Bought a bulk lot and there was all but 1 minifig in there.

3	Gave it to my girlfriend for her town.

3	Need to find her a Ristorante now.

3	Nice review Sinner!

3	*y* My favorite part of this set is the parrot in the front window!

3	*wub*

3	Awesome set!

3	I really like the robots, and that tiny tank could be quite useful!

3	All the fancy machinery in there really make it more like a lab than a restaurant!

3	:-D The thing I found most funny was the positioning of the middle finger on the hand.

3	:-D :-D Definitely gave me quite a laugh.

1	and im not a bit curious on what the fuss is about.. your review is super as always yoda but i really cant say anything about the set cause i dont know what it is about!

1	The same counts for me.

1	I have never seen a single show.

1	So I only can argue about the bricks as are.

1	I don?t like all the SB sets because of the inflationary use of stickers.

1	>:-( More to that see below.

1	There are some bricks that are really cool like the bun disk, but I won?t buy this set just for single bricks.

1	I do like the color selection because of the comic strip relation though.

1	copmike, on Aug 15 2007, 10:42 AM, said: On the stickers issue I so agree with you *yoda* - and I think it?s time to start a revolution >:-)!

1	Yeah - revolution ON!

1	If someone cares for the tar I?ll bring in the feathers!

X-D as for the review, if it actually is a review and not a homage, cos you really have to be clear about that on these boards :-| , ... well... what can I say?

2	*yoda*

3	Due to a larger BL order in the U.S.

3	I couldn?t resist to add two Hopper Waggons to my train layout.

3	Here?s a review of this fantastic set.

3	The box.

3	Well, there?s nothing really special about it.

3	The open box with three polybags.

3	Note, that there are only three different colors used in that set (actually there are 4, but you can?t see the dark grey ones).

3	Great color composition by the way.

3	*wub* And - NO STICKERS !!!

3	- :-D Oooops - I opened the bags too fast.

3	Help me, I?m drowning!

3	*sing* Not following the instructions, I built the wheels first to get the larger pieces out of the way.

3	Keep on rolling.

3	This is the load of the hopper waggon.

3	11 round bricks altogether.

3	When I opened the set, I was curious if it was a new colored set or an old one.

3	Luckily enough it was an old one, with old dark grey.

3	I don?t know if TLC ever produced this set with bley.

3	From the following pic you can clearly see, that the set is an old one.

3	Look at these slope bricks.

3	See what I mean?

3	All bricks are looking exactly the same!

3	Buy a set today means get at least three different textures on the slopes and maybe even more shades of tan.

3	:-X >:-( I have said that in many other threads here and I?m saying it again: Back to the roots, Lego!

3	You were able to produce good quality.

3	Show us you can still do it!

3	*sad* But now to the building.

3	It?s a 6 x 24 train base plate you?re building on.

3	Did I say I liked the colors?

3	:-D This is the mechanism to unload the waggon.

3	Built in the waggon with open gates... ... and with closed ones.

3	Almost done.

3	This is the first time, I realized that minifigs actually can step on those ladders.

3	:-$ A short lift and the wheels are fixed.

3	This darn mechanism!

3	Wait, I?m coming with my monkey wrench!

3	>:-) Who opened that door again?

3	Do I have to do it all on my own?

3	:'-( Finally the work is done.

3	Now have a brake.

3	One shot from the front/back.

3	You can see the car is really huge!

3	8-?

3	I put it behind the red car of the 4512.

3	That sure looked very strange.

3	*wacko* The set fits a lot better to the other cars of the "My Own Train" theme than to the older ones.

3	The Score: Brick selection: 10/10 excellent color and brick selection (these were the days...) Playability: 9/10 great unloading mechanism Price/piece count ratio: 8/10 at peeron it says 20$, I got it for 39,95$ -> 30?/228 bricks.

3	Not really cheap, but worth every cent!

3	:-) Overall rating: 9/10 and a definity "must buy" for rolling stock lovers.

3	Sad enough it?s not available on S@H any more.

3	But there are still sets on BL and ebay.

3	That?s for now folks, thank you for reading.

3	I have some job to do...

3	Great review of a great set!

3	*wub* I look forward to more!

2	Great review.

2	Very funny with "little you" helping with the building.

2	I got the wagon myself, i really like it.

3	You're in it and using a Fabuland wrench!!!

3	Such a clever review with a great sense of humor!

3	I really liked this train set and it adds so much to a train layout, especially when you buy multiples.

3	TLC is throwing away a potential gold mine by discontinuing this line.

3	:'-( It is also nice to see those beautiful consistent slopes in that picture.

3	It really is sad that TLC is letting quality slip.

3	They don't seem to be responding to the issue they way they did the bley/frown fiasco.

3	perhaps we AFOL need to make more of a stink!

3	To the embassy!!!

3	>:-( Again great job Holodoc and thanks for sharing *sweet* *y* What an excellent and fun review!

3	!

2	Thank you guys for your nice reply.

2	:'-) I have to add two pics of my freight train showing a bit more clearly what the size matter is about: This is what it looks like when you put the Hopper Waggon right behind the red car of 4512.

2	It looks a lot better without the red car!

2	I had a lot of fun with this review and I will add another one (look at the 2nd pic ;-) ) the next days.

2	Stay tuned!

3	Great review.

3	I hope you mini-self is OK after all of that LEGO burying him :-D This is one of the great sets that LEGO has produced, since forever.

3	I think more sets like this should be manufactured *wub* - Poomie

3	I loved the pic of your sigfig buried under legos :-D It's too bad Lego did not continue to make more of this style of set.

3	Great review, *y* I have just bought my first 9V motor and you have convinced me, I will buy a least two of this set.

3	:-)

3	Yes my SpongeBob fans, its time for another review !!

3	Lets look at our Bikini Bottom map and head strait to meet Miss Puff at her Boating school.

3	She is waiting for us to give us a guided tour of her establishment ;-) Another bit of SB history: this set comes from the following episode: Boating School: SpongeBob fails his boating test for the 38th time (what a freaking retard lool).

3	He's so determined to get his license that Patrick decides to help him.

3	He implants a walkie-talkie inside SB?s head in order to cheat and tell him what to do.

3	You will say that I am biais but I really enjoy building this set and I really like the SB theme !!

3	Lets hope 2008 brings more of that cool spongieness !!

3	But I digress...

3	Here are general pics of the instruction booklet and the DSS (G there are loads of crappy stickers in that one also !!).

3	As you can see the set is divided in 3 polybags.

3	Shamelessly (but nonetheless wilfully hehe), I will disregard the third one which is that playability crap course !!

3	I would have reviewed it but since it involves stickers, I didn?t want to ruin the parts and without stickers it would look dull, plain and ugly (it does look crappy with so imagine without), so that review will not be 100% complete and I do apologise in advance.

3	But how many of you would have build that and keep it hehe Off :-P 1/ Mfs and extras I will start with the really cool Miss Puff *wub* (the fig mind you !!).

3	She looks a bit stressed !!

3	No wonder, that sponge menace will bring her to the hospital once again hehe.

3	As you can see, that MF comprises 3 parts: the small blue 1x1 round and the 2 major parts.

3	Yeay another great stupid looking SB.

3	I love those idiotic faces !!

3	3 different SB figs and 3 idiotic faces hehe.

3	You never can get enough of them !!

3	Here is just a regular Patrick.

3	Too bad Patrick doesn?t have different expressions !

3	The pull back boat car: nothing really to report (except the fact that I left it sticker free !!)

3	The only thing I built from the third polybag is that pretty cool ancker holding tower thingie !!

3	Looks great in a lighthouse set hehe.

3	Yes the roud tile bouey is printed !!

3	Its the same as in SB's bed in the Bikini Bottom set ;-) OK, its time for those two great buildings: the lighthouse and the school + pontoon !!

3	Before reviewing them individually, here is a general pic.

3	2/ The lighthouse One of the main reason to own that great set !!

3	Sure it suffers from accute stickeretite (sad but :-D ).

3	T worst is that door), but nonetheless a great and simple building !!

3	Great white/red colour scheme, and a really fantastic 2 turning lights !!

3	I really like the yellow top of the lighthouse, it adds to the comic atmosphere of that theme instead of having a more plain red/white only.

3	The rear has nothing really fancy, except tools to fix it in case of problems hehe.

3	The only thing I modified since I didn?t build the third polybag is that I got rid of the trechnic parts on the right of the lighthoue to replace them with regular ?logs?

3	All hail the tower King !!

3	:-D 3/ The school and pontoon I really like that little building and its great to see that once again TLC uses the amazing dark blue color !!

3	Its really a simple design but looks fantastic and can be used for many things in a town hehe I also really like the combination with those dark bluish grey slopes !!

3	The rear reveals the desk, stickers on the wall (d?oh !!)

3	and two clams serving as chairs (really like on the show).

3	Its really great to see that TLC stays really as close to the show as possible.

3	The pontoon again is simple yet really cool and effective.

3	And its really nice to have 2 lifesaving boueys.

3	The only thing I modified since I didn?t build the third polybag is that I got rid of the trechnic parts in front of the pontoon to replace them with regular ?logs?

3	On the overall, I think its really a great set !!

3	Apart from the crap stickers, I think TLC should have ditched (or simplified) the third playability polybag to lower the cost !!

3	Oh well, parts are always usefull (except those one part shitty palm trees !!).

3	So until my next review, I bid you farewell my Spongebob fans !!

3	And I really hope to see next year hehe Will SB get his driver?s license one day ?

3	For the sake of Bikini Bottom, lets hope not !!

3	No license ever On !!

3	*yoda*

3	That?s really a great and overall nice playset with a very cool Mrs.

3	Puff and a fine new Spongebob!

3	*sweet* The boating school?s indeed very nice with a beautiful color scheme, and so is the lighthouse....

3	I?m really tempted to buy a second set just to "complete" these buildings.... although it?s a little too expensive for doing so, and it wouldn?t even fit with the style of the other SB sets.

3	X-D Wet highway to the poor puffer fish?

3	privat hell on!

3	:-D

3	You've done it again.

3	*yoda* !

3	Great reveiw.

3	I really like this set, but in my opinon, $50 is steep considering I won't actually 'play' with it.

3	I mean, half of it is a track for peat sake!

3	Ill eventually get it for the Mrs.

3	Puff figure, though.

3	*y*

3	*yoda* comes through again!

3	I love this set... but it just costs too much for Australians so I will be giving it a miss.

3	:'-( It is a shame as it has clams in it... 8-|

3	I like this one better than the other one for parts and such, plus I'm generally a sucker for any different minifig, but yeah, that price is steep.

3	Great review though!

3	One more SB face - YEAH *wub*!

3	Being a lighthouse freak I really like it, the trans clear blue ones rocks *y*!

3	I?m getting it - period!

3	SB On copmike

3	Another great review, thanks *yoda*!

3	Man, those smooth slopes really look like crap when on a roof :-| That was the whole reason they had texture in the first place... |-/ I'll never liked those, they feel so cheap!

3	The new SB head is great, and can Mrs.

3	Puff's legs move?

3	I just ask since her feet are separate, and in figs where the legs can't move, they're usually one piece at the bottom to keep them from breaking off.

3	The set looks great, and seems to have a lot of playability

3	Nice review !!

3	I'm not a big fan of those Spongebob figs.

3	However this set has some very useful pieces.

3	This is actually the first time I took a decent look at a Spongebob set.

2	Yoda, I don't thank you for this review, and after the Chump Bucket review too!

2	Because I'm so exited to have them that since I ordered them from s@h, I come back home aftre the work the faster I can, with the hope to see a big box on my bed... and this, even if I know that it tooks more than 6-7 days to have my order...

2	This Mrs.

2	Puff figs is really really nice *wub* And this 3rd SB head too!

3	Man, that Sponge-bob head cracks me up!

3	Hilarity.This is a cool set, although I much prefer the Chum Bucket set.

3	I don't see what's wrong with the course, then again I can see why AFOLs wouldn't like it.

3	It's just playability really.

3	I like the breakable wall though.

3	The building is cool, a few modifications (i.e.

3	making it more realistic, real chairs for a start) and it would make a cool little wharf for your Lego town.

3	And to SW4J, Mrs Puff's legs are connected at the feet, if you look closely.

3	So, thanks for the great review, *yoda*!

3	Thank you *yoda* for strike 2!

3	It?s SB again.

3	|-/ Sticker Alarm!

3	:-X But this set is better than Chum Bucket.

3	There are far more interesting parts if you don?t like SB.

3	Especially the light house and the little hut with the wooden pontoon.

3	*y* And yet again another set with smooth slopes and rough ones... Too bad, too bad.

3	>:-( >:-( >:-( If I just knew the person who is responsible for that... >:-)

3	Nice review mate, the set look's great and a real must for all those SB fan's out there.

3	The whole set scream playability that's for sure, which is great because let's be honest their's gonna be alot of kid's and *yoda* out their playing with it :-P X-D ;-) .

3	Geezzzzz what is it with all those bloody stikers?

3	This set would be soooooo much better with printed piece's instead of those, still once your over that at least the rest is ok. Am i the only one who thinks Mrs Puff kinda look's like a kinder egg toy?

3	Their's nothing wrong with that mind you (yes i have a kinder problem X-D ) just seem's strange to me.

3	Maybe mrs Puff has a nice toy inside X-D I like this review.

3	The lighthouse part and the school are nice enough for other towns.

3	and the figs are nice, even mrs puffs 2 pieces you can't use for other things.

3	:-) Pity that it's 50 dollars/+/- 60 euro.

3	for half price I would think about it.

2	lets beam Miss Puff out of reach asap !!

2	and prepare to retaliate with Clamu's pearl canon !!

2	Bring it on Trekie >:-) :-P *yoda*

2	Holodoc and Yoda, don't be so hard with, or I will call my stronger friend, you know this aqua-squirrel aka Sandy!

2	And Sandy can have fun with our doc, Texas style >:-) *yoda*

3	I might get this and convert it to a lighthouse and warehouse for a city Dock...looks nice.

3	WALL on!

3	Very nice review *yoda* !!

3	Though, I think you should review the "course" because it looks very interesting.

3	xwingyoda, on Aug 16 2007, 10:11 PM, said: Hey Patrick, I'm on your side :-D !!

3	*yoda* Oops, I read too quickly, so misuderstood!

3	:-$

2	It looks like a good set but I would rather get the neighborhood one.

3	The set, and the other Designer sets that came out with it (especially 4888) are incredibly well designed sets.

3	I wish Lego would go back to doing sets like these as I loved the multitude of instructions and ideas.

3	The last batch of Creator sets had zero ideas, even though I know several were made.

3	:'-( Anyway, less whining, more review.

3	The lion is the main model.

3	His mouth doesn't fully close, but it does open more.

3	The head works well from most angles.

3	I love the dark orange bricks; great for rust...

3	He is quite solid, but the joints take the weight well.

3	The neck goes side to side and rotates, but doesn't go up and down.

3	The body is built in two parts and pinned in the middle.

3	With what is left you can make what I think is a hyena, a silly plant MOC... ...and what I believe is a vulture.

3	There are also instructions for a few other models including a bat, boar and a snake... which I quite like.

3	He can be built at the same time as... ...this cute little lizard.

3	Overall this is a great set with an excellent blend of colours and pieces.

3	I wanted it for steampunk potentials.

3	*sweet* I hope you liked the review.

3	Till next time....

3	The lizard looks the best to me - put him in a town and you've got a monster terrorising the residents.

3	Dr. S.

3	Great review as always!

3	*y* LEGO is timeless, so there is no such thing as an old set.

3	I never build brick monsters/creatures, but this set had such a nice assortment of parts that I had to pick a couple up as they weren't clearancing out on Shop @ Home.

3	I absolutely love dark orange and tan, so it was an automatic win.

3	I love the use of "familiar characters" in the review, I can almost hear Hinckley screaming, "my megabloks!"

3	:-P You sort of look like you're planning some vulture stew though.

3	Might have to start a new challenge to determine a winner there.

3	Sinner and his Big Pot o' Doom VS Giant Vulture!

3	Only thing is, does everything horrify the Mrs?

3	She seems perpetually shocked and/or dismayed at the goings on here.

3	Now that I think about it, I can see why.

3	I'm occasionally shocked and/or dismayed 8-?

3	Brick Built Beasties On!

3	*y*

3	A very fine review of a very fine set, thanks Sinner.

3	*y* The variety of cool colors in that set?s just formidable.

3	One more beautiful Creator set indeed!

3	Roaarrrr on!

3	:'-)

2	Thank you for the nice review, Sinner!

2	I also bought this set but in combination with 4883 when it was on sale (50% - hurray!)

2	at S@H. I made a short review of 4883 but wasn?t really sure what to tell about 4884.

2	So I?m glad you did that for me.

2	:-D I have different feelings about this set.

2	On the one hand I love the lion.

2	He is really impressive (even my wife -not known for being Lego enthusiastic- asked me, if there were more animals of this kind).

2	The lion is - restricted - poseable and the colors used are fantastic.

2	*wub* 3 models can be built simultaneously - that?s great!

2	On the other hand I still don?t know what to do with these rotation joints.

2	*wacko* And the other models are somehow disappointing compared to the lion.

2	I seem to have missed the little lizard.

2	:-$ I put it on my "to do-list".

2	Like all the Creator sets: Great parts pack - but wait until they get on sale!

2	X-D For me - I had a lot more fun with 4883.

2	Indeed: Roarrrr ON!

2	;-)

3	A broken man, I seached stores over and over again for a good deal on that set, and I found it last week for $25 AUD ($60 List).

3	I hope she's not allergic for skeletons too.

3	:-P :-D By the way: Great review, You made a nice warm, soft place to sleep for Hinckley.

3	Sigh, I really REALLY wanted to buy this when it was on sale on S@H and I never did and now it's no longer available :'-( It's a great set with a nice amount of bley, but a crapload of tan.

2	It's one of those sets I could buy 100 of and still want all of the pieces.

2	*wub* In particular, the vulture has several hinges, black wings, and the dark red pieces that I want loads of.

2	Sorry.

2	:-$

2	I was really kidding, of course you want to keep it.

2	Who wouldn't?

2	;-) I was going to buy it off of BL anyway.

2	X-D Now, if lego made a theme about Creator animals, that would be great.

3	LEGO 75915 Pteranodon Capture I'm glad to review this nice set; 75915 Pteranodon Capture Name: Pteranodon Capture Set Number: 75915 Pieces: 174 Price: $19.99 Minifigs: 2 Theme: Jurassic World Year of Release: 2015 Links: Box The front of the box has the Jurassic World logo along with the set number, piece count, etc.

3	Its a decent box size for a $20 set.

3	Here it is compared to a minifigure.

3	Here's the back of the box.

3	It shows all of the features from the set an ad for the video game.

3	The back also shows a small picture with a silhouette of the dinosaurs from the line, along with their set numbers.

3	Instruction Booklet The booklet shows the same thing as the front of the box, nothing more, nothing less.

3	Near the back of the booklet, there is a picture with all of the characters from the sets.

3	The other page shows all the dinosaurs with a mini box that shows the size comparisons.

3	The Minifigures The minifigures in this set are Simon Masrani and an ACU.

3	Both of them have excellent printing on the front and the back.

3	The gun is the same one from TLM that the SSP used.

3	Simon Masrani is the only one with a double sided face.

3	His second face shows a scared/worried exp<b></b>ression.

3	He has a zipped up jacket or jumpsuit with a shirt underneath.

3	The ACU trooper only has one face which is a scared/worried exp<b></b>ression.

3	I would have a scared exp<b></b>ression too if I was about to get eaten by a dinosaur.

3	He has great detail on his torso and legs.

3	Let's take a look at the vest.

3	The vest is the same mold from the SSP in TLM I think.

3	It has the letters ACU on the front too.

3	The back is nothing interesting.

3	Pteranodon The pteranodon has great printing too.

3	The colors match the ones that the pteranodons from the movie have.

3	The wings, mouth, and head are a rubbery type of plastic and are easily bendable.

3	It uses the same mold from the pteranodon in the 2012 Dino line.

3	Here's a comparison between the two.

3	Spare Parts The spare parts aren't many, just a few extras.

3	The Helicopter At first the helicopter was 'meh' when I first saw it on the box.

3	Now that I've built it, I've got to say that I really like it.

3	Its my favorite helicopter of all of the ones I've built.

3	Its sturdy and sleek.

3	It's not too bulky either.

3	The first play feature in this set is the net launcher.

3	It works pretty well, not one of my favorite features but it does what it's meant to do.

3	The other play feature is on the other side.

3	Its a stud shooter which can be used by a minifigure.

3	You can put it on their hand or you can leave it there and let someone operate it.

3	The shooter can fold up inside the helicopter as well.

3	There are stickers on both sides of the helicopter and they also have the Jurassic World logo with Dino marks.

3	Final Verdict Value: 9/10 - For $20 this set isn't that bad.

3	The parts count is a little low for a $20 set but the price is probably because of licensing.

3	Other than that, it's a great deal, I would've hoped for maybe some bait for the pteranodon but that can easily be fixed.

3	Design: 9/10 - I REALLY love the way this helicopter looks, it's sleekness and design is great.

3	The only flaw this has is the huge net launcher, it's too big in my opinion.

3	Minifigs: 10/10[/b] - The minifigures are extremely detailed and it even includes an exclusive minifigure.

3	Playability: 9/10 - There are many things you can do with this set.

3	The swoosh factor is great and so are the play features.

3	Parts: 10/10[/b] - They're useful parts and there isn't many huge specialized pieces in here either.

3	Overall: 9/10 - This set is great for fans of Jurassic World, it's also a nice parts pack.

3	There's one exclusive minifigure in here too which makes it even better.

3	Having a little fun with the set Hope you liked my first review here on Eurobricks!

3	Please leave any suggestions on what to improve, thanks!

3	Edited by TheLazyChicken, 02 May 2015 - 10:19 PM.

3	Thanks for the review!

3	I really like this set.

3	I love the ACU minifigures and the dinosaur is really nice.

3	I think the helicopter has great potential for a SHIELD helicopter.

3	Only suggestion is that some of your pictures are a little bit dark.

3	(Especially the box front one) But really good for your first review!

3	Thanks a lot!

1	I love the dinos in these sets but aside from that the builds IMO kind of suck just like the last Dino sets.

1	This just has a franchise connected to it.

1	And honestly I hope it does well enough to spark more Dino/Jurassic Park-World interest because I want to see MORE Dino "minifigures".

1	Maybe a Brontosaurus or something.

1	I will most likely be buying many of the Dinosaur minifigures here.

1	However I doubt I'll buy the actual sets or the genetically altered dinosaur (which can only work for Jurassic World).

1	This set is IMO average.

1	Love the dinosaur...

2	Nice review!

2	Although, that picture of the ad reminded me of how some of the things surrounding Jurassic World (Lego, that is) seems hastily put together.

2	Just look at that the minifig.

2	He is Star Lord's head and hair, Indiana Jones' torso with different arms, and City legs.

2	To me, that seems a bit weak, especially for a video game.

2	Oh yeah, I just noticed that

3	Yesterday I went to Toys 'r Us and bought the Dilophosaur Ambush.

3	Beside that the shop had a display of the JW polybags.

3	For €3,49 I picked up two of them.

3	Now here is my little review of this pretty nice set.

3	First some data: Line: Jurassic World Year: 2015 Pieces: 29 Price: €3,49 Packaging: Polybag Ok, lets start with the polybag itself.

3	It is a standard size and had plenty of room for all the parts.

3	The front depicts the whole set with a little hexagon on the right with a seperate picture of the dinosaur and its name.

3	In this case the Celophysis is called Gallimimus.

3	Weird choice Next is the instruction sheet.

3	It is a doublesided paper with every building step in clear sight.

3	The part selection is nice.

3	There are only a few but all of them are pretty usefull for all kind of builds.

3	There are two parts which stood-out.

3	Both are printed tiles.

3	The first one is the yellow/black warning tile in 1x4.

3	You can't have enough of that.

3	The second one is a 2x2 tile with the Jurassic World logo on it.

3	That's pure awesome.

3	The bigger sets seem to have only sticker for that, so this little set is a perfect way to get hold of this nice tile.

3	The leftovers.

3	Nothing special.

3	Here is the complete trap.

3	It is a basic build and functions pretty well.

3	In the end the parts are more interesting as the build so it will definitely end up as a parts-pack.

3	Now on to the star of this bag.

3	The Celophysis/Gallimimus.

3	I don't know why Lego decided to call this dinosaur mold any different, but I think it has to do with movie-connection and the will to not produce a new mold.

3	Nevermind, this figure is great and the colour is very bright and totally stood out.

3	Pretty beastie.

3	A comparison between the 2015 Gallimimus and the 2012 Celophysis.

3	The final set in all its glory.

3	Final verdict: It is a great little set.

3	The parts used a nice and usefull.

3	The printed tiles are the secret stars of this set and the dinosaur is fun two.

3	With a few packs of these you could easily build a Celophysis pack with lots of Jurassic World signs on their way.

3	Highly recommended.

2	nice little review!

2	now i definitely have to check if the toys r us in dortmund has it, too!

2	Edited by KCMatze, 03 May 2015 - 01:34 PM.

2	I'm pleased to see that this is available for purchase, at least in some parts of the world, rather than only being available with the JW game.

2	Nice review, I'll going to scope out whether Toys R Us in Sweden is carrying them, although I've never seen polybags in there before.

2	Nice review!

2	I really hope its avaliable for sale in the US.

2	Thank you, guys.

2	I'm glad you liked this review.

2	It's a nice little set.

2	Great review man, really well written and structured.

2	Hoping to go on a hunt and see if this is available in UK stores soon.

2	Nice I had to buy the JW Lego game to get mine.

2	Great review!

2	But Spoiler I didn't see or even hear mentioned a Galliminus or any sort of dino trap in the movie.

2	I wonder where this design came from!

3	Lego 31036 Creator Toy and Grocery Shop Thanks to EuroBricks for making this review possible!

3	For years, Lego has offered a house of some sort in the Creator line each year - with the standard Creator 3-in-1 instructions, that's given us a very wide variety of housing.

3	In 2014, they added a business option with their 31026 Bike Shop and Cafe set.

3	This continues into this year's Toy and Grocery Shop set.

3	These shops are smaller than the very detailed modular buildings, but that should help them fit in better with the other City sets, and this also lets them get into more kids' cities with their lower pricetag.

3	Name: Toy and Grocery Shop Set Number: 31036 Pieces: 466 Price: $39.99 Minifigs: 2 Theme: Creator Year of Release: 2015 Links: Bricklink Peeron Brickset The Box The front of the box shows the "A" version model out of the three, plus insets of the B and C versions.

3	I like the sorta-European looking backdrop; it goes well with the styling of the buildings.

3	Interestingly, the main model is shown opened up for play, while the two insets show those versions folded.

3	The Box Top On the top of the box, Lego helpfully shows that with 3 of these sets, you can make a whole street.

3	The Box Back On the back, you get to again see all three versions together, but this time, folded.

3	It's a little creepy though with those clones running around :) The Manuals Yep, three actual, printed manuals.

3	There's nothing indicating them as being A, B, and C models, but it's pretty obvious looking at the designs which is the "main" model and which are the alternates.

3	The Contents Bags of parts and two plates.

3	Nothing terribly exciting to see here....

3	The Minifigs Nothing new here, but two nice figs none-the-less.

3	Well, Bricklink does say that both figs are unique to this set, but there's not any new parts to them.

3	The closest thing to rare is the female head - it's only in this set, 2013's Dragon Mountain Castle set, a UK store grand opening set, and one of the 2014 Holiday freebie sets.

3	The faces aren't that unique, but I guess this exact combo of two faces on the head is.

3	I love the kid torso with the spaceman on it.

3	The Minifig Backs No back printing on anything here except for an alternate female face.

3	Sorry.

3	I do like that her two faces are so different though.

3	That's much better than when a head has a "scared" and a "more scared" face.

3	The "C" Build Enough with the basics; let's build.

3	I'm going to review them in the same order I built them, backwards.

3	Since you can tell immediately looking at the 3 designs that they're going to use different numbers of pieces and so forth, I figured I'd build the smallest first lest it seem like a letdown.

3	All three have some basic similarities - the two plates are hinged to give a building that opens for play.

3	They also do have interiors, which you can see starting to form here.

3	The "C" Build, Front It's a pretty quick build, so it's done already.

3	Here's the front of the building with it opened up.

3	Like this, it appears to be two separate stores, a newsstand and some sort of shop you can enter.

3	All the printed tiles help give the newsstand a detailed appearance, but I'm not sure why they've got a $100 bill lying on the ledge...

3	The "C" Build, Rear From the back side, the interiors are pretty plain.

3	The shop half has a plant in a jar and a weird chair, and the newsstand just has a register.

3	The "C" Build, Sides Here's the two sides of the folded building.

3	On the hinge side, there's a bunch of windows in a disjointed wall with random colors.

3	On the other, why did they put in a huge window when the set does include a trans-clear door that could have gone there?

3	And you get a small patch of plants, like so many sets seem to have these days.

3	The "C" Build, Extras That's a lot of leftovers there.

3	And not just little stuff - multiple doors, stairs, etc.

3	And unused sand green is always a little sad....

3	The "B" Build, 1 A pretty similar start, with the hinge and little garden and some tiles along the ground.

3	The "B" Build, 2 Now we see a big windowed wall, some details like lights, and how it has the usual alternate model "weird part usage" - like a 1x4 brick with side studs being used over the doorway, even though those side studs will not get used.

3	The "B" Build, Front The finished building gives us a nice little post office, with a letter-carrying bird on the roof.

3	Hope that's not their normal method of delivery!

3	Something about the colors just doesn't work for me though.

3	The combo of white / light grey / dark grey / black / sand green plus tan is just too much.

3	The tan window and door frames I don't like.

3	The "B" Build, Inside On the inside, things are weird.

3	The counter on the left is ok, but the light above the door (with a yellow clip?

3	ugly!)

3	is too big, and everything else over there by the door doesn't make much sense either.

3	The "B" Build, Sides I like the front side here, except the colors are still too much.

3	The bench, greenery, mailbox on the corner, and streetlight are all nice.

3	The boy is a little creepy though - binoculars in hand PLUS a telescope on the roof of the post office?

3	Why?

3	The hinge side shows more of the weird colors you get in the wall, but that's going to be hidden when the set is open.

3	Plus we even see that on big modulars at times, so it's not SO terrible.

3	The "B" Build, Leftovers Again, a lot of leftover parts.

3	It's obvious this was another alternate, but it'd be nice to see more of them used to make a bigger building.

3	But let's move on to the model that DOES use them all...

3	The "A" Build, 1 The first half starts like this.

3	Maybe it's just my bias, but it already feels like a more detailed build.

3	Bottles on the wall, the yellow and red awning over the window, etc.

3	The "A" Build, 2 The other half starts off with detailed work too.

3	I think that's a red vending machine.

3	The stairs are also VERY solidly built.

3	I also appreciate the effort to get that diagonal base where a door will be - it's such a nice touch to have sections of a building that aren't right angles.

3	The "A" Build, 3 Not too much has been added, but I wanted to showcase the tiny toys before they get hidden by a wall.

3	That robot and train are just fantastic little micro builds.

3	The "A" Build, 4 Things are coming together quickly.

3	The walls, windows, and doors get the first floor nearly done.

3	I'm still not big on the sand green and tan combo, but I do really like the red and yellow awnings.

3	The "A" Build, 5 It appears the shop owner lives upstairs, since we've got a bedroom forming here.

3	The bed is a little plain, but the table and lamp on the other half are great.

3	And my big fingers did not like putting all those railings on the balcony, with the telescope posts and tile tops.

3	Knocked quite a few off before I got them all done.

3	The "A" Build, Front And it's done.

3	All the details make this set really feel like a mini-modular.

3	The roofline has great greebling, and the shop contents, and on and on.

3	It's not perfect though.

3	The tiny car above the toy store door isn't nearly as good as the toys inside.

3	And the kid's yellow scooter?

3	The wheels aren't even on the ground, much less able to roll.

3	The scooter looks decent though, so that counts for something.

3	Well, at least as long as you are at this angle, since the boy's only got 1 foot on the 1 stud wide scooter.

3	The "A" Build, Inside Most of the interior has been seen already.

3	The roof though does a nice job of being interesting for a roof.

3	A skylight, the edge rails, etc.

3	And you can see there's not much "wrong color" in the walls.

3	The "A" Model, Sides An interesting building when folded up.

3	Very tall and skinny.

3	You can tell it's not really meant to be displayed this way - it's meant to be open.

3	The good - lots!

3	I like the awning, the diagonal door, the flowerbox under the upper window, the folding gate on the balcony that lets it be used in open or closed mode, and the green / white / blue colors.

3	The bad - well, the stairs end short of the upper door, I still don't really like the tan doorframes (I think black would have been better), and why don't the upper floors match up in size?

3	The "A" Model, Leftovers Ah, that's more like it.

3	Just a few small pieces left as spares.

3	The Errors You might have to click through to the full-size versions, but I did catch a few weird errors in the manuals.

3	First, in the photo of the newsstand, the map in the front corner is on there sideways.

3	The map does have a clear north arrow printed on it.

3	On the second image, the boy's feet are hanging off the edge.

3	Just unusual to see an alignment error in the manual like that.

3	The Comparison Here are this set and the modular Detective Office side by side.

3	There's a huge difference - as you'd expect.

3	But is the difference MORE than you'd expect?

3	This set is 466 parts, $40.

3	The DO is 2262 pieces and $160.

3	5 times the parts, 4 times the price.

3	Looking at them side by side, I'd expect a bigger difference in both.

3	The Conclusion So, what's my conclusion on this model?

3	I love the main model, but the alternates are meh.

3	It's a nice set for someone looking for a town building other than police and fire stations, but who isn't ready to move to the modular line.

3	Compared to the modulars though, it seems overpriced.

3	Part of that is because the huge modulars are actually a great deal compared to other Lego sets.

3	I'm also a little surprised that it's so small, when you compare it to the City sets like a police station.

3	Those are generally designed with much more open space, letting them be more of a playset.

3	This one is small and cramped, so it'd be tougher to play in.

3	It's not really a City set though.

3	The Ratings Value: 7/10 - It's under the 10 cents a part mark, but that's largely due to having a TON of tiny parts.

3	All those flowers and decorative 1x1 round studs add up quickly!

3	Design: 7/10 - Good and bad on the colors, and there's a big difference between the quality of the main vs alternate models.

3	Having so many leftover pieces is one thing when the Creator set makes 3 very different models (ie a boat, plane, and truck).

3	When it's 3 buildings, it seems wasteful to have so many parts leftover.

3	Minifigs: 6/10 - I'm not sure they both fit the set.

3	I suppose the boy is going to the toy store and the woman is going to the grocery?

3	But there's no storekeeper in either.

3	The woman doesn't look like a storekeeper to me, so that's why I assume she's another shopper.

3	I love the boy, but the woman is just so-so - except that I do appreciate the head having two very different expressions.

3	But again, that doesn't fit the set.

3	I can't see her scared face being used.

3	Playability: 6/10 - The shops are detailed with registers and so forth, but it's all so tiny it'd be hard to play with the figs in it.

3	Parts: 9/10 - Tons of windows and doors, plus nice sand green bricks.

3	But some things (the large blue curves used on the roof for example) are weirdly specialized and would be hard to use in another building design.

3	Overall: 7/10 - I'd recommend doing what I did - build the alternates first, then the main since that's how you'll want to leave it.

3	I'd really like to see the price a little lower compared to other sets (again, the part count is inflated due to SO MANY tiny parts) and the finished building is tiny, but it's loaded with neat details.

2	Great review!

2	Very thorough.

2	It's not a set which makes me run to tye store, but it definitely has some fun elements.

2	I do like your new grey background.

2	Your pictures look great!

2	Any chance you have a picture of the News Stand next to the Detectives Office building as I would love to see the scaling for that?

2	Nice review mostlytechnic.

2	I particularly like the use of grey background surface for the pictures.

2	It somehow makes the building stand out more.

2	Good job!

1	A terrific, very comprehensive review - but I'm not at all impressed with this set.

1	It feels like a mishmash of bricks with no clear design aesthetic and as such blatantly underdeveloped (i.e.

1	designed to hit a price/brick count point rather than provide a solid set in the Creator Town tradition).

1	Compared to other Creator sets at this price point (31025 - Mountain Hut, for example) it feels utterly uninspired and ugly.

2	Well, I felt like the main model ALMOST got to good looking :) I'd replace some of the tan with black, but otherwise I'm ok with that one.

1	Cheers for putting in the time to create a wonderful review.

1	I am not a huge fan of this set; I like the colour combinations, but it all seems a bit all-too-simple.

1	It can (and will) be nicely modularised, though!

2	Thanks 'mostlytechnic' for this review, I only brought this set to continue the shop series from creator.

2	In my opinion it's only half as good as the bike shop/cafe one.

2	Plus it doesn't fit the same as that pair of shops, oh well maybe next year Lego creator will have a better one.

2	Brick On Review On 'mostlytechnic' !

3	Reviews for this set really should picture them next to the Bike Shop & Cafe, which it's intended to be compatible with right down to the size of the baseplates and grey tiles around the edge.

3	It doesn't look that great on its own, but if you add the two sets together you get something that begins to look like a street scene.

1	Brick On Review On 'mostlytechnic' !

1	Well, it IS only half the price of the bike/cafe one too :) But I agree, it seems odd that they've made a couple "shop" creator sets that don't fit together in style like this.

1	I guess they've done that for years with the creator houses though - none of those really work together.

1	Interesting to get two comments right in a row with opposite opinions :) I don't have the bike/cafe set, but to me, they don't looks like they'd really go together.

1	They're the same concept (two buildings that fold in half) but the sidewalk is different size and they just feel differently styled to me.

2	This seems like half of a set compared to the previous Bike Shop/Cafe.

2	As I like many of the elements, I will probably buy a second one and build a mirror image version (making one entirely a toy shop and the other a book store/news stand) and adjust the sidewalks to work with the previous model.

2	Then I think they will work well together.

2	I remember a little area in Copenhagen that had this sort of architecture.

2	I would hope the subsequent models are better deigned to create more complex alternatives, but these are both good starting points for original or enhanced models.

3	As a fan of Creator houses, I really want to like this set.

3	However, I think that Creator houses have long filled a niche that's neglected elsewhere: residential houses.

3	We haven't had a larger residential house since 2013; I'm not sure if these sets have anything to do with that, but it seems like they may be the replacement for larger houses.

3	And I'd much rather have a larger house set than a set like this.

3	I also agree with many others here; something about it just feels incomplete.

3	I think that the various City business buildings we've gotten in recent years (including those in this year's City Square--which is much more expensive than this, but also contains much more) make for better buildings at this scale.

3	Thanks andy_0306uk, your very clever strategic decision to serve us with blurry pictures allowed me to glance at this review without ruinating that whole wonderful Advent surprise too much.... :-P *y* But although I loved the last year?s one, I think they could do another theme (or perhaps even two calendars), because right now Castle?s pretty hot IMO.

2	Thank you Andy for your speed review!

2	*y* So there?s nothing left to open while advent?

2	;-) I like all the tiny sets, it needn?t be another police- and fireman |-/ , but well, what would an advent calendar be without them?

2	:-D One thing about the train traffic lights: TLC used to give us similar lights, but you could show either of the lights with the other one being covered: That one was waaay better!

2	:'-( Just a little piece more would have done the thing... ...and I won?t mention the radar-crap-dish :-X Let me quote Franz Beckenbauer: "Is' denn scho' Weihnacht?"

2	(legendary quote from an promotional job he did years ago - "is it X-mas already?")

2	Yeah, I guess this would need a little more "out of the box" thinking than TLC?s doing usually for their Castle line....

2	Things that are similar to the City theme, and more civil life based, like some blacksmith equipment, market place, bakery, farmer and so on, but a wizard workshop, a hidden treasure and some medieval furniture would also work fine.... And an evil Santa with spiders and coal pieces as gifts.... and a sledge pulled by a dragon of course.

2	:-D

1	no girls....AGAIN!

1	and no santa?

1	whats up with that?

1	sure there are many nice pieces to give life to every city layout.. i would love something more simple a girl taking her dog for a walk a boy on a bicycle simpler things...not all the workmen again!

3	Informative review, thanks!

3	*y* As usual, it makes a fairly good parts pack.

3	Wish I could pick up a few on deep discount, but at full price one is fine.

3	I do like the 'stewards' and some of the workmen.

3	Overall, I think I'm looking more forward to the Belville calendar, just for it's assortment of unusual parts.

3	Ugh.

3	Belville.

3	Still, parts are parts, and it's got some.

3	Phoinix summed up one of the most common complaints I hear about all of the lines in 3 simple words ... "no girls....AGAIN!"

3	Good job, now get LEGO to listen.

3	;-)

2	Whoa!

2	It's out already!

2	*places order* I guess I should thank you Andy, because I might have missed this one just like I missed last year's calendar.

2	Now all I have to do is wait two weeks and pick it up at the post office across the border.

2	Nice review.

1	Thanks Andy for the review!

1	I prefer the city advent calendar 2006 a lot!

1	Those mini sets are nor good for me!

1	The "road subtheme" sets are nice, but the others, not so good!

1	The 05 version waf ok, the 06 version was better, with bigger sets, and more building ones!

1	And the 07 is poor!

1	It's just 2-3 pieces to put together on 2x4 plates... Where are the gardening accessories?

1	Where are some nice small constructions that you can put in your layout like a mailbox or an orodator?

1	And the chrismas tree looks :-X IMO!

3	*yoda* Wow, interesting!

3	Lego is really expanding with this advent calendar thing!

3	Watch, next year they'll have ones for specific themes, Boy o boy, think about it, Star Wars Advent Calendar, Indy Advent claendar.

3	Of course, this is only speculation, but it would be cool!

3	X-D I'll probably buy both of these (even though I'm a boy ;-) ) so I get 2 surprises every day instead of one!

3	:-P ;-)

2	I'm a big fan of anime and have watched some mechas like Full Metal Panic, Neon Evangelion: Genesis (it is a mecha!)

2	and Chobits (Well... She is a robot...), so I was curious to see what this new Exo Force line was all about.

2	The colorful sets and manga-like characters didn't persuade me right away, but the urgent need for a couple of white 3x3 wing plates made me purchase this little thing.

2	It cost me 70 DKR as you can see on the box.

2	This is 9.30 euro, or about the same an American has to pay for the new Republic Cruiser.

2	Pretty expensive for so few pieces (90 + a spare technic pin) The box An action-packed box with one of the sides being oddly empty except from the LEGO-logo.

2	What's inside There is a small building instruction, two polybags (no bag building here) and a sticker sheet with alarmingly many stickers.

2	The build It takes so little time to build this set that I didn't get to take any pictures of the process.

2	Every step was accompanied by an element description although I doubt most of you will need that with so few pieces to keep track on.

2	Most of the dark green bricks have a sticker - even the slopes where the rough surface makes stickers fall off easily!

2	There should also have been a sticker on the windshield, but I wanted to keep that piece clean for better usage later.

2	(I'm one of those who keeps stickers on the bricks) The model You want to see this model from the front, as the back is pretty much neglected There isn't much for the pilot to grab a hold on either.

2	He is pretty much a sitting duck up there with the screen giving him only partial cover.

2	There is a huge wrench next to him which kind of symbolizes the crudeness of the mech.

2	The set isn't called "Cyclone Defender" for nothing.

2	The right arm might hold an ordinary light assault riffle, but the other has a spinning disc with samurai swords which you can turn with the yellow knob on the backside.

2	Those of you who have seen Robot Wars might remember the incredible power of this melee weapon from a robot named Hypnodisc.

2	It would have been nice had there been a pull-back motor to power the disc (I'm sure LEGO has a lot of these in stock), but the simple mechanism still works reasonably well.

2	The riffle comes off and a pin makes it easy to hold with the hand, but the disc is fixed to the arm.

2	It is also a problem that the swords get misaligned quickly during play.

2	The minifig I really like this minifig because of the neat idea with an expression on each side that LEGO has made a standard for Exo Force.

2	Posability Most mech-moc'ers show off their creations using Gundam-like poses.

2	With two joints per leg (one being the ankles) and one for an arm I thought of some less serious poses: Crawling (Silent like a ninja!

2	): Belly gliding: Kick off!

2	; Upside down: Final Rating I have to disappoint you here.

2	This is my first set in this line and I have absolutely no idea of how good it is.

2	The last robot I bought was the awesome 6889 Spyrius Recon Robot for the same price, but it is in a completely different genre.

2	The set had what I expected (two white wings) and is as such a no-nonsense set.

2	I guess it would be of more use if you have some more Exo Force, which I don't.

2	6/10 Ups: Has great minifig, weapons and is easy to build.

2	Downs: Crude design and a bit too expensive for what you get.

3	A funny review with cool pics, thanks Lasse D. A somehow mediocre mecha design, but a beautiful dark green color!

3	Upside down mecha yoga exercises on!

3	:-D

2	Nice review :) But... You paid HOW much?

2	This set is priced around 7 Euros here in Germany, which is a very fair price for what you get in my oppinion.

2	It?s a little disappointing though, that I couldn?t think of any alternate builds for this set, and there are no inspirations on the box or the EF website.

2	9.30 euro is MSRP here in Denmark.

2	7 euro would have resulted in a nicer reception from my part, but the strong marked position of LEGO in its homeland together with the general high prices (because some of us are supposedly rich...) makes the prices less bearable.

2	It is funny you should mention Germany.

2	I thought the prices for LEGO were even higher there!

2	I'm sure I paid more than MSRP last time I bought LEGO from from your country.

2	On the other hand.

2	The last thing I bought was the 5521 Model Team sea jet from 1993!

1	I was going to buy one of these but decided not to.

1	I am glad now seeing the rather annoying construction.

1	The minifig is good though, Thanks for the review!

2	DJ Force, on Sep 17 2007, 11:02 AM, said: I guess that?s what some people refer to as "sarcasm" ;) Oh... 8-| My bad... :-$

3	I couldn't find a review of this wonderful set in here, so here it goes!

3	I got the set for MSRP (180kr = 24 euro) which is a fair price here in Denmark.

3	As all other Creator sets there are instructions for several models (3 in this case).

3	The box The box is a little larger than City sets in the same price range.

3	The primary model is shown on the front while you see the secondary ones on the back.

3	What you get 312 pieces in 5 polybags and two building instructions: one for the primary model and the other for the rest.

3	The built It was impossible for me to speed build this model because of the nifty functional details from the retractable landing gear to the wings that can turn by means of the handle in the back of the model.

3	It took me a full hour to build it because I had to "test" how it all works together.

3	The finished model The landing gear isn't fully enclosed when retracted and the models are sub-minifig scale, but I still love the design of the models.

3	The doors for the rear wheels open as you pull the wheels down and the final piece of functionality comes from the wings that can either tilt (the horizontal stabilizers) or have elevators.

3	Wing in, wings out, wings in, wings out... Ratings As a whole I actually like this set even more than the Big Rig.

3	The models are just as diverse but the added functionality makes the plane more fun to play with than the rig.

3	Price: 7/10 - A good price, but not a bargain as the Big Rig Design: 9/10 - There could have been a sligtly higher level of details in the main model, but all models are really good looking and I especially like the design of the hovercraft.

3	Functionality: 10/10 - I guess you could ask for working rudders, opening cockpit and so on, but the plane is really filled with movable parts and the turning of the wings works really well.

3	Secondary models: 7/10 - A hovercraft!

3	How awesome is that!?

3	If only the last model was just as inventive instead of a standard helicopter... Modifiability: 8/10 - The bricks are in ordinary colours and there is a good variety of them giving you plenty of possibilities for MOC'ing.

3	You can easily make the main model into something that looks more like an F-14.

3	9/10 Probably as good as it gets for a Creator set in this price range.

3	It is entertaining to both build and play with, looks good and the secondary models are worth building as well!

3	(Brickshelf gallery)

3	Thanks!

3	I was planning on doing this review but I have been a bit swamped lately.

3	:-$ Great review of a great set.

3	It isn't too hard to convert the plane to Mini-fig size either.

3	(Sorry I forgot to take photos...) I might add some photos to your review....

3	Nice review and a nice set.

3	Thanks for taking the time.

3	I'll want to pick this guy up.

3	Hovercraft Alternate model.

3	Uses around 4/5th of the parts.

3	It is cool but a bit fragile.

3	Great review Lasse D. A definite two *y* up.

3	I bought this set for the swing-wing concept.

3	I was very curious what TLC's design was like.

3	I have been working on modifying it just a little to look more like the F-14.

3	So far I have completed the back section, but I need to finish the cockpit.

3	Overall this is a great set.

3	I *wub* TLC's swing-wing concept.

3	Model On!

3	!

3	this is a really great set!

3	when i first saw it i thought "oh a silly small plane who needs that" and then i got it and i am very happy that i did!

3	this is one of the best designed lego creator sets!

3	and it was designed by the designer of the Cafe-Corner!!!

3	!

3	A fine set, a great review and good additional pictures.

3	Thanks Lasse D and Sinner.

3	Teamwork on!

3	*y*

2	Thank you Sinner for bringing the pictures of the hovercraft.

2	I think it is a really cool model, but The steering wheel doen't work too well.

2	It doesn't turn easilly all the way around and when the craft turns, it doesn't stay stable on the three wheels because the front wheel turns quite alot into the opposite side.

2	Now to the third model!

2	This is quite a basic helicopter with the functionality of having the rotors turning.

2	It doesn't use that many of the bricks and doesn't even have a landing gear.

2	I have a question to all of you.

2	As you can see, I prefer to show one or two large pictures and have the rest as clickable thumbnails.

2	Most people use only the relatively big (typically 640x480) pictures so that you don't have to follow links.

2	What do you prefer?

2	It is no problem for me to do it the other way, but I would like to know if you have any preferences.

2	I agree.

2	Errr... sorry if I have annoyed you by posting the pictures.

2	Looking at your Brickshelf folder you had taken photos of the hovercraft as well and I seem to have stepped on your toes.

2	:-$ Feel free to beat me up, or I could do it myself if you prefer... 8-| (I prefer bigger pictures as I get tired of clicking, waiting, clicking, waiting.

2	If the pictures are all there all you have to do is click then wait!

2	:-P )

3	Thanks for this excellent review Lasse D!

3	:-) I was thinking about getting this the other day but decided not to.

3	I regret my actions!

3	Glad to see Creator making great sets, the theme has so much potential, I just wish that this set had more models... |-/ Oh well can't have it all, anyway, Thanks!

3	*sweet* Batbrick Away!

2	I can see the loading issue when you click a lot of pictures (I normally hold CTRL down so that they open in their own tabs... but they still have to load).

2	Any other opinions?

2	That's a relief!

2	:-) I didn't make the helicopter as it didn't impress me very much.

2	I was curious about the hovercraft though.

3	?34.99 is not too shabby.

3	The big guy itself is nice, but the gem of the set is the Mech.

3	Really nice Mech I must say!

3	Great for posing.

3	The Mini figs Suprisingly nice little build/vehicle.

3	Never seen this element before....its probably nothing new though, Lol.

3	No articulation of the legs?

3	Nooooooo!

3	Phew!

3	The front two legs do articulate.

3	Would of been bad if they didnt.

3	Overall, I give the set 7.8/10.

3	Not the best, but its actually quite nice, and the Yellow Mech is awesome.

3	If it was him on his own, then 9.4/10!

3	Cheers

1	Thanks for the review!

1	I really dislike this set but I thought much worse of it when we saw the first pic.

1	I think it was a good idea (mech transporter) pursued in a horribly wrong way!

1	:-X Thanks again!

1	:-) Batbrick Away!

1	>:-)

3	I so need to buy this!

3	Where did you get it from?

3	It says limited, so I guess it?s only available in certain stores, as the Bridge Walker was, or Supernova or Golden Guardian.

3	Nice!

3	*y* Doesn't look that bad at all, but what's with the first pic?

3	The one of Skeleton Tower?

3	*wacko* Is it so we can see the corner of the intructions?

2	:-P __________________ Thats what I was thinking!

2	*wacko* In the future when I buy all the exo-force sets off bricklink or ebay, I'll get this one for the decent yellow mecha, and cool function (carrying mecha), and just for completion sake.

2	Most people are getting to worked up over this, one bad set doesn't mean the end of exo-force, though I would like to see less two-legged mechas and more unconventional designs like the Shadow Crawler and Bridge Walker.

2	Batbrick Away!

2	>:-)

1	Consider the first pic a freeby pic, to whet your appetite.

1	:-$ 8-?

1	:'-)

3	It?s for sure an at least interesting set.

3	The idea of attaching that small mecha to the bugs body is very good, so it works like a counterpart to the Aero Booster.

3	Pretty nice.

3	Although.... only the two front legs?re articulated?

3	That?s a shame.... :'-( Thanks for the review, ReZourceman.

3	*y*

2	I like how the back is a prison, but aside from that it looks like spare parts to me!

2	Thanks for the review though.

2	*sweet*

3	Nice!

3	I really want this now.

3	The yellow mech was the thing I disliked on it, but now its my favourite part of it.

3	-ZotS

3	that yellow mech would make a killer $10 set!

3	I would buy it on its own... *wub*

2	Why are the best sets limited editions?

2	>:-(

2	Nightmare_Zero, on Oct 14 2007, 03:59 PM, said: Why are the best sets limited editions?

2	>:-( You can still get it quite easily at S@H or in Lego Stores.

2	I know of one in Oberhausen and in Cologne, and I think there?s one in Hamburg and Munich as well.

2	Depending on where you live you might get it in one of those shops fpr 49.99 Euros.

2	I just got set number 7721, the new special edition crawler thing in woolworths in croydon, england.

2	Apparently it is a woolworths exclusive over here and i didnt expect to see it on shelves for a while yet.

2	Pleased to get it, just about to start building it.

2	looks like a very good set.

2	I love the yellow mech.

3	i got a set of this but i planning to sell away to earn money to buy another set since im almost broke right now.

3	:-D i got a set of this but i planning to sell away to earn money to buy another set since im almost broke right now.

3	:-D

2	Does anyone have a box pic of this set?

2	DP8

3	It is no secret that Marvel is one of the most successful companies right now.

3	From the Avengers to the X-Men and down to even the most obscure characters like Ant-Man, every one of their movies has been a big hit until now.

3	The latest Marvel movie, Fant4stic, was released last month and while I have not seen it yet, I'm sure it's just as great as their other movies.

3	I mean, it has the word "Fantastic" in the title after all!

3	And being the smart business that they are, The Lego Company decided to get in on the hype early and capitalize on this movie's undoubtful success two years in advance by making a set featuring Fant4stic's main villain, Dr. Doom.

3	Now that's what I call forward thinking!

3	But did they do a good job with it or were they being overhasty?

3	Let's find out!

3	Set Number: 76005 Name: Spider-Man: Daily Bugle Showdown Theme: Marvel Super Heroes Subtheme: Ultimate Spider-Man Year of Release: 2013 Pieces: 476 Minifigs: 5 Price: $49.99 USD S@H description: Quote Swing into the Daily Bugle and stop Dr. Doom™!

3	Dr. Doom™ and his henchman Beetle™ are attacking the Daily Bugle in their speedy jet to steal Spider-Man's™ secret identity.

3	It's up to Spider-Man™ and Nova™ to swing in and stop them!

3	Trigger the Daily Bugle's explosion functions to cause destruction as the jet fires missiles!

3	Stop Dr. Doom™ from hitching the jet's anchor hook to the safe with Spider-Man's secret inside!

3	Knock Beetle™ off the building with the swinging web attack and drop Dr. Doom™ inside with the rooftop trapdoor!

3	Then fly Nova™ in through the broken window with the dumpster catapult function and send those villains back to where they came from.

3	Includes Spider-Man™, Nova™, Dr. Doom™, Beetle™ and J. Jonah Jameson™ with accessories and weapons.

3	The first thing that comes to mind after reading this description is: Wow, that's a lot of TMs!

3	Anyway, here are some resource links for this set: Brickset Bricklink Rebrickable The Box Since this set is based on the Ultimate Spider-Man cartoon, the box has the usual USM design with the red Marvel Super Heroes background, an illustration of Spidey in the upper right corner, and the USM logo in the lower right.

3	As usual, there is a minifig line up in the lower left, and since this was before the terrible redesign, you can see the full body of the minifigs.

3	I really miss this type of line up.

3	There is quite a lot going on here: Doctor Doom attacking the Daily Bugle in his jet while simultaneously reaching for J. Jonah Jameson below with his jet's claw, Spider-Man (reluctantly) swings in to save him, while Nova fights off the Beetle.

3	It's a pretty cool scene, even though it's not very accurate to the show.

3	In "Beetle Mania", the episode that this set is based on, the Beetle was indeed out to kill JJJ, but it was in order to stop him from exposing his identity, not Spider-Man's (although Spidey was next on JJJ's list).

3	And while he is a recurring villain on the show, Doctor doom had nothing to do with this plot and didn't even appear in the episode aside from a brief cameo.

3	It's awesome that they included him anyway, though, so I'm not gonna complain.

3	Note that the tower is so tall that it wraps around the top of the box.

3	There, you can also see a scale reference with the Spider-Man minifig.

3	On the back of the box, you can see the interior of the Bugle and all of its play features which there are quite a few of since this is a playset.

3	It's all illustrated pretty well, although Lego's choice of sound effects is still a mystery to me.

3	I don't get why they don't go for Spider-Man's signature "Fwip!"

3	instead of "Fazzing!"

3	and I didn't know that a breaking window made the sound "Btoom!"

3	but I digress.

3	Contents Inside the box you will find three instruction booklets (one smaller than the others), a comic book, a fairly large sticker sheet, five numbered bags, and two loose pieces: A white string piece and a gray 16x8 plate.

3	There aren't really any notable pieces and nobody cares about the comic bock (no offense to the artist), so lets get right to the instructions.

3	They are pretty straight forward and easy to follow.

3	Some of the pages have a ghostly image of Spidey, Nova, and Dr. Doom in the top right corner which is fitting since these are all minifigs that appear in this set (which is strangely not something that can be said for many other Super Heroes instructions with this type of artwork).

3	Minifigures As with most Super Heroes sets, most people will get this set mainly for the minifigs, so without further ado, let's talk about them.

3	Spider-Man is the same old bootless one you get in almost every USM set.

3	Not much to say about him.

3	Some might complain that we don't get Spidey's alter ego Peter Parker in this set, but in the USM cartoon, MJ is actually the one who works at the Daily Bugle, not Peter.

3	Curse the creators of this cartoon for ruining our chances of getting a new Peter Parker minifig by trying to mix things up.

3	Next we get J. Jonah Jameson.

3	He appeared in a Spider-Man 2 set before, but this is a complete redesign.

3	He now has a blue suit with a red tie, a unique face print, and that combed-back hair in dark gray.

3	This new hairpiece doesn't suit him at all and the old flat top hair was perfect for him in my opinion, so I don't know why they changed it.

3	The good thing about this change, however, is the fact that this piece is exclusive to this set in that color.

3	Nova on the other hand is spot-on.

3	He comes with a new helmet mold and some nice torso printing.

3	However, he, too, is missing his boots.

3	TLC should have started making dual-colored legs a long time ago.

3	Here are some reference images to compare them to.

3	Okay, so JJJ's hair may not be completely black in the show, but I still think they should have given his minifig a black hairpiece.

3	His suit is also not quite the right color.

3	He rarely appears in person in the show (including the episode this set is based on) and is usually seen on screens around New York, so this is the best picture of him I could find.

3	I guess I should be happy they included a minifig of him at all.

3	In the episode, it was actually Mary Jane who was at the Bugle during Beetle's attack, so it would have made more sense to include her, but we got her in the Spider-copter set one year later, so that's ok. All three of them have back printing.

3	In JJJ's case I'm using that term loosely since it is only comprised of two lines, but it's nice that they went through the trouble of adding them.

3	Both JJJ and Nova come with angry alternate faces.

3	It almost looks like they're trying to out-angry each other.

3	Who do you think looks angrier?

3	Let me know in the comments section below.

3	Now let's talk about the bad guys.

3	Even though he would be better off in a Fantastic Four set, it's great to finally get Victor Van Doom, one of the greatest Marvel villains ever and in comics in general.

3	He comes with a dark green hood which was new and exclusive in that color at the time, and he is the only minifig in this set that has leg printing.

3	Beetle is a regular minifig with wings.

3	The metallic printing on his face and torso is pretty nice, but I wish it would have continued onto his legs as well.

3	The Beetle looks quite accurate to his on-screen counterpart.

3	The only thing that could have improved him is a new helmet mold with pointy eyebrows/antennae.

3	Doctor Doom, however, looks nothing like he does in the movie.

3	I just don't understand how Lego could have messed him up so badly.

3	Maybe they were working off of early concept art or something.

3	Here is a back view of Doom and Beetle.

3	Beetle would be a pretty boring minifig if it wasn't for his wings which are awesome with their holographic texture.

3	They are so mesmerizing, I could look at those things all day.

3	This piece also appeared in trans.

3	light green in the Galaxy Squad sets which came out at the same time.

3	Here they are without their gear.

3	As you can see, they both have back printing as well.

3	And no, Doctor Doom does not come with an alternate facial expression, which is fine since you can't see much of his expressions due to his mask anyway.

3	Here's a look at Dr. Doom and Nova without their headgear.

3	Some say that Doom's face looks too cartoony, but I think it looks fine.

3	Nova is wearing stylish goggles as a way of explaining his white eyes.

3	It's a far better explanation than the Bat-sweatband.

3	They did the same thing with the masked Wolverine later.

3	Here are all the figs with their accessories.

3	JJJ comes with a camera so that he can take "more pictures of Spider-Man!"

3	Beetle comes with one of those overused ADU guns which is a very poor representation of his wrist-mounted blasters.

3	I hate to say it, but even those bulky new stud shooters would have been a better representation of his weapons.

3	Spidey comes with his usual string of webbing and Nova comes with some Iron Man style translucent studs.

3	The weird thing is that they are red while his powers have a blue glow in the show.

3	Doctor Doom sadly doesn't get any accessories, but who needs weapons when you have a jet with a claw and flick-fire missiles.

3	The Build The first bag contains Spider-Man, a brick separator, and the parts to build the ground floor of the DBC building.

3	After a quick and straight-forward build, you get this.

3	The dumpster and street lamp are separate from the building and since the lamp post is not built onto any baseplate and is quite top-heavy, it gets knocked over pretty easily.

3	Maybe it's meant to be that way, but I would have preferred it if you could stick it onto the baseplate of the building on which there is unfortunately not enough space to do so.

3	As you would expect, the second bag has the parts for the first floor of the building.

3	This is also the bag that contains Beetle.

3	After another fairly simple build, you'll find yourself with a two story building with a spiderweb one side and a fire escape on the other.

3	However, you have to apply three stickers during this section of the build which is never fun.

3	Can you guess what's in bag number 3?

3	Yup, the second floor of the building.

3	You don't need superpowers to predict that one.

3	Also, this bag contains Nova and Jameson.

3	The build of this section is a bit repetitive since the second floor is mostly the same as the first and it takes slightly longer to build since you have to build the rooftop as well.

3	Also, in addition to the two window stickers you have to apply ten 2x2 tile stickers!

3	Trying to do this without having any of them being crooked is a real pain in the megablocks.

3	The next bag contains Doctor Doom and the cockpit of his jet.

3	Doom's cape is in the usual square white box and the string for the claw is folded up in a piece of tape.

3	Here's what you get at the end of this section.

3	Looks more like an escape pod than a jet at this point.

3	The final bag is the smallest as it only includes the few parts needed to finish the Doom jet.

3	Once you build the wings and tail, you stick them onto the cockpit via Technic pins and you're done.

3	Spare Parts These are the parts that are left over after the build.

3	There is the brick separator of course, an extra antenna, and the usual little bits and bops.

3	What's really awesome, though, is that they give you an extra pair of Beetle's wings!

3	Considering what a neat piece this is and that this is the only set in which it comes in trans-black make this a very welcome spare that you can use in your customs.

3	The Finished Set Here is the complete set.

3	The DBC building looks quite tall, especially when you count the antenna.

3	Comparing it to a screenshot from the episode, the general look of the building is there, although there are some inaccuracies.

3	Aside from the fact that it is obviously way down-scaled, the screens that show JJJ ranting about Spider-Man should have been hexagonal, not square, and should have wrapped around the building.

3	However, considering how many stickers you would have had to apply if they would have made it accurate, I'm actually glad they kept the screen mercifully small.

3	Much like Doctor Doom himself, the Doom jet didn't actually appear in the Beetle Mania episode.

3	However, it did appear in a later episode titled "Not A Toy" in which Spider-Man plays around with Captain America's shield, accidentally drops it in Doctor Doom's Latvarian embassy and has to try to retrieve it.

3	And yes, that episode was as godawful as it sounds.

3	Here's a screenshot of the jet from that episode.

3	Like with the DBC, they managed to capture the general shape of the vehicle, although it doesn't look quite as good as in the show.

3	The color scheme is too dark and it looks kind of blockier.

3	Let's take a closer look at the jet.

3	There is no real way to reel the claw in unfortunately.

3	However, there is a stud on the back of the jet that you can stick it onto.

3	Needless to say, this is not the ideal way of storing it.

3	I would have much preferred it if they would have attached it onto winch instead.

3	The engines on the wings can be turned, even though they don't turn in the show, and there is a flick-fire missile on each side.

3	Even if it's not much to look at, at least it's a very swooshable vehicle.

3	On top of each wing there is a tile with the emblem of Latvaria.

3	There was no such emplems on the jet in the cartoon, but they are useful pieces that make it clear whose jet it is, so I'm glad they included them.

3	There is nothing inside the cockpit except for a seat and unless you want to ruin Dr. Doom's nice dark green cape, I wouldn't put him inside of it.

3	They could have at least printed a control panel onto that empty 2x2 tile.

3	Play Features Since this is a playset, let's look at all the play features it has to offer.

3	Like all playsets, the building is open in the back so you can play inside.

3	On the ground floor, there is a potted plant and... nothing else.

3	Seriously?

3	Is this all they could come up with for this floor?

3	They could have included a security desk, a lounge, a second plant, or anything else!

3	As it is, it's just a boring empty lobby.

3	The first floor is a bit more interesting.

3	There is a safe, a swiveling chair, and a pin board with various pictures of Spider-Man.

3	There is one tile that reads: "The true identity of Spider-Man" which is supposedly what the villains are after.

3	I wonder how Jameson got this information in the first place.

3	Speaking of Jameson, the second floor is devoted to his office where he can sit and yell at his non-present employees, demanding "more pictures of Spider-Man!"

3	It also has a swiveling chair as well as a desk with a lamp and a computer.

3	There is a Technic beam connecting his desk with the ceiling of the first floor which you can remove in order to take off the upper half of the building, but it's difficult to do, so I don't recommend it.

3	As you may have noticed in the picture above, there are a few red pegs sticking out of the building.

3	These are for triggering the play features.

3	Most of them are on the roof.

3	There is one on what looks like an air conditioning unit.

3	If you place Spider-Man holding is web-string on the jumper plate in front of it and push the peg, Spidey goes bungee-jumping off the building.

3	Wee!

3	There is also one that sticks out of the side of the building which when pulled triggers a trap door.

3	The third red peg on the roof can be used to pop off the DBC sign.

3	Why is it called the DBC, you ask?

3	It stands for Daily Bugle Communications since in this version of Spider-Man, the Daily Bugle is not only a newspaper, but a news TV station as well, one that promotes its own highly biased views.

3	So basically the Fox News of the Marvel universe.

3	I guess if you're an old school Spider-Man fan, you could just leave off the "C" and have it just stand for Daily Bugle.

3	The sign above the main entrance wont be so easily modified however.

3	There is also a peg between the first and second floor which when pushed pops out one of the windows on the first floor.

3	The safe is only attached to a couple of jumper plates and has some jumper plates on top of it as well, so you can easily attach the Doom jet's claw to it and rip it out of the building as seen on the back of the box.

3	There are also some SNOT bricks on the corners of the building that you can attach spiderwebs or Spidey himself onto for some wall-crawling and webslinging action.

3	This is not so much a play feature as it is just a feature, but as I mentioned earlier, there is a fire escape on the left side of the building.

3	This was a neat idea as it helps it feel like a building in New York City, but it is executed very poorly.

3	There is no hole big enough for the minifigs to climb down through, so they would have to climb down the ladders from the outside which makes no sense.

3	No wonder Spider-Man always needs to rescue people from burning buildings.

3	There is one more play feature in the form of the dumpster.

3	You can open the lid, put a minifig inside, and make them jump by hitting a tab in the back.

3	Remember, this is before the introduction of super jumpers, but nevertheless it's a pretty strange place to launch minifigs out of.

3	I guess even Super Heroes like to do some dumpster diving.

3	You don't think this was funny?

3	No?

3	Well, me neither, but that's the type of humor that this show loves to use.

3	Sigh.

3	Anyway, let's get on to the ratings.

3	Ratings Design: 2/5 - The set looks ok.

3	Despite many inaccuracies, the DBC building and the jet somewhat resemble their on-screen counterparts and don't look too bad, but they definitely could be better.

3	Build: 1/5 - A mostly unchallenging and repetitive build with an attrocious amount of stickers.

3	Minifigs: 4/5 - Definitely the strongest point of the set.

3	Some of the figs could be better, but four out of five of them are exclusive to this set.

3	Doctor Doom is easily the best and probably the most desirable one - unless the Fant4stic movie portraits him so badly that nobody will be interested in him, but that's impossible.

3	Playability: 4/5 - As you would expect from a playset, the playability is quite high, although I still feel like there could have been more.

3	Parts: 3/5 - Not many rare parts.

3	If you're looking for parts for building your own skyscraper with tan walls and lots of doors and windows though, this set is for you.

3	Price: 3/5 - At 476 parts for $50, this set is a bit pricey, but it is somewhat justified by all the large window and wall pieces.

3	Overall: 3/5 - This set is mediocre at best.

3	Playsets are always a good choice for Spider-Man sets since they give Spidey something to swing from, but unfortunately they are rarely pulled off well.

3	The jet is blocky, the building is bare-bones, and the price feels too high.

3	The only reason to get this set are the four exclusive minifigs.

3	This set was discontinued early this year, but if you still see it on clearance somewhere, go ahead and get one for the minifigs and parts, or buy multiples and use the parts to build a better DBC building.

3	I hope you enjoyed this review.

3	It is part of the Reviewers Academy's 7th Anniversary.

3	We're not doing a big celebration this year due to other commitments, but look out for more reviews with the 7th Anniversary banner soon.

3	Now, if you'll excuse me, I am off to see Fant4stic.

3	I hope it's as fantastic as it promises to be!

3	(2 hours later) I was wrong!

3	I was horribly, horribly wrong!

3	Hahah, entertaining and informative, a great read- thanks for the review!

3	On a side note I thought Fant-Four-Stic was....ok. On the poorer side of ok.

3	The exposition felt like it was from a 3 hour film because it was so long and towards the middle it started to drag.

3	The ending was terrible.

3	This is my favourite set!

3	Should be making more Spidey sets like this IMO.

3	*cough* Oscorp Tower *cough*

2	This set is from 2013, Doctor Doom is completely based off the Comic version/ TV Show version, not the movie in any way.

2	Anyways, nice review.

2	I personally own this set, and it's a nice set, but could have been better.

2	Edited by Aegis2000, 13 September 2015 - 02:33 AM.

3	Yeah.

3	I'm really hoping the concept art/Doom minifig joke is just that!

3	I picked this set up on whim, mostly because a needed a building to add to a MOC, as a parts pack it's not a bad set at all.

2	Thanks for the review, i've had that set for quite a while, and it's among my favorite Marvel Superheroes Sets actually.

2	Compared to the other stuff we usually get to accompany the minifigs... All those "Laboratorys", the most recent Construction Site, and the "Hydra Fortress" .. yeah... You're being a little harsh here Maybe you're still suffering from PTSD after watching Fant-Four-Stic!

2	He's just joking about Doom.

2	I actually am surprised at the poor points this set has gotten, as this is one of my favorite sets that Marvel has put out.

2	I actually would like to hear what your thoughts are on the USM - LEGO Dr. Doom comparison, Oky.

2	Thanks for the review.

2	Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad set, especially compared to some other sets we have gotten in this price range, but somehow I was still expecting more.

2	DarthBrickus, on 13 September 2015 - 02:53 PM, said: Maybe you're still suffering from PTSD after watching Fant-Four-Stic!

2	I still have not seen it actually (and I don't ever plan to).

2	So don't worry, no Okys were harmed in the making of this review.

2	Im a brickmaster., on 13 September 2015 - 03:55 AM, said: Yeah.

2	I'm really hoping the concept art/Doom minifig joke is just that!

2	Yes, the whole Doctor Doom/Fant4stic thing was obviously a joke.

2	Everybody knows what Doctor Doom is supposed to look like, except for the makers of Fant4stic apparently.

2	Zorglorfian, on 14 September 2015 - 06:44 AM, said: I actually would like to hear what your thoughts are on the USM - LEGO Dr. Doom comparison, Oky.

2	Thanks for the review.

2	http://marvelanimate...or_Doom_USM.png There's not much to say really.

2	Doom in USM looks just like he does in the comics, and Lego recreated that look perfectly.

2	Again, he's definitely the best part of this set.

2	I'm glad you were joking about Doom.

2	I'm not that big of a fanboy, but I had the need to correct you for some reason.

2	With that said, I bought this set for the minifigures a few years ago.

2	Looking back, I don't really care about the figures today like I did in 2013.

2	The building is decent for the size of the set though.

2	Thanks for the review.

2	For those of you who are old enough to remember System Shock: Next on Maury: Who's the Father?

2	Edited by DarthBrickus, 15 September 2015 - 05:28 PM.

2	Overall, I wish Marvel in particular would have more playsets in its theme (Batman has several great ones in the DC theme).

2	But then again, if this is the best playset to date for Marvel, maybe it's better just to leave well enough alone.

2	I would definitely like to see them attempt something in the $100+ (US) price range because I think it could be good; Marvel needs an equivalent to the Arkham Asylum set.

2	Regarding this set, I saved myself some money and bought the 4 minifigs I needed (all but Spidey) on Bricklink for less than half the set price.

2	Edited by dmarvin, 17 September 2015 - 06:25 PM.

2	Personally, I thought your review was spot on and I very much enjoyed your tone.

2	I'm not usually much of a mini-fig person, but I will admit I bought this set mostly for Dr. Doom (and considered Nova a bonus).

2	Growing up, I was a big fan of the Fantastic Four and an even bigger fan of Dr Doom.

2	I hope that someday the film rights will revert to Marvel and we'll finally get a FF film that respects the original source material and features a Dr Doom worthy of the name.

2	As for the set itself, I don't have much use for playsets (not that there's anything wrong with them, I think the Marvel Lego line could use more of them in fact) and I didn't even realize it was linked to a specific show as I've fallen a bit out of touch with the franchise of late.

2	I bought it; I built it; it sat a shelf for a while; I scrapped it for parts.

2	I think most of it wound up as a greenhouse for my winter village set-up.

2	It's not a _bad_ set, but I think you summed things up nicely when you called it mediocre.

2	Thanks for the entertaining review.

3	Thanks for the review.I'm not a big fan of Spider Man sets, but this set really impressed me.

3	This must because of the design of this set and the minifigures that included in this set.

1	I think I'm the only person in the world who likes Fant4stic... Was it the best superhero movie?

1	Not even close, but I didn't think it deserved the hate it got.

1	It was just incredibly and clumsily mishandled.

1	Anyways, great review.

1	I might pick this one up if only for the Beetle fig.

2	This set seems to appeal more to the non superhero crowd.

2	It is one of the only marvel sets I bought.

2	Mainly because I thought that the building was a nice return to the old style of city sets.

2	I would love to see this sort of backdrop for a more realistic agents theme...

2	I also liked that most of the figs in this set were easier to merge into other (non-super) uses...

2	Thanks for the review!

2	God Bless, Nathan

3	Another great review Oky.

3	I love this set.

3	Hi again!

3	They have arrived *wub*!

3	They come dismantled inside the package instead of one piece like the Blackhole Stormtrooper did.

3	They have the head and SW-sign made with magnets to clip on to the torso.

3	It actually works even if it feels a bit "cheapish".

3	Here?s some pictures - Mr Vader goes first *vader*: Package Pieces Stormie: Package Pieces My collection so far >:-) : Here?s the Blackhole Stormtrooper review.

3	:-D Shorter than I was expecting though.

3	Hello everyone!

3	By now many excited LEGO Star Wars fans have started receiving their UCS Falcon.

3	Some of us here enjoy writing reviews and sharing our thoughts.

3	I mentioned to Yoda that I was planning on doing a review of this set but it would likely take me a few weeks (of 1-2 hours per night) to finish building the set.

3	Yoda suggested that I do the review as I go so everyone could see the progress of the set.

3	What a great idea!

3	So, here is the first entry.

3	Feel free to comment along the way.

3	I will try to post photos and updates every night on the build then wrap up the review when I complete the set.

3	If you have any specific questions or photo requests, please be sure to ask.

3	UCS Millennium Falcon Reviewed by Dunamis Set 10179 5195 Pieces $499.95 from LEGO Shop at home The Box: Obviously, this is a box like no other.

3	First of all, it comes in its own shipping carton.

3	Inside of that, there is a standard LEGO carton.

3	Finally, inside the LEGO carton, we have the actual Millennium Falcon box and a nice little letter thanking you for buying the biggest LEGO set ever.

3	Shipping box (Naboo set provided for scale) LEGO Carton and letter LEGO Carton The Millennium Falcon box is really quite nice.

3	There are lots of photos and it does a good job of ?selling?

3	the set.

3	There are 8 individual pieces of tape that keep the lid on the box.

3	The limited first edition comes with a seal on the lower left corner.

3	Millennium Falcon Box (Naboo set provided for scale) Lifting the lid straight up reveals one compartment of several bags on the right.

3	On the left, we find a thin, square box (like a pizza box) that contains the official certificate of authenticity, two sticker sheets and one enormous manual!

3	Under the pizza box, we find two more compartments each filled with several typical LEGO bags.

3	The box weighs 24 pounds!

3	Stickers Pizza Box Pieces in compartments Not quite sure what the little 30th anniversary sticker is for yet.

3	The Certificate of Authenticity is on heavy paper and is suitable for framing.

3	More to come tomorrow.

3	It's late here.

3	Good idea to make this review while you build the set.

3	I'll be monitoring your progress and feedback.

3	The box so huge!

3	Impressive!

3	Nice review.

3	I'll be watching and waiting for the rest.

3	Will follow this impatiently ;-) Really like the start of the review *y* You always seems to pull it of nicely, in comparission with the exasperating *yoda* X-D :-P Build On!

3	Play On!

3	On On!

3	Many tks Dunamis for doing that, its really great and I can't wait monitoring your progress on the beast 8-?

3	Like it was mentionned in another thread, the box looks less gigantic than I thought - remember the ISD box !!

3	That was a huge box !!

3	Is the instruction book in the pizza box ?

3	How big is it ?

3	I'm sure its really big and I hope for our sake that the colours are clearly marked X-D If you know what I mean :-D !!

3	Tks againand I'm so looking forward to your next post !!

3	Excellent beginning.

3	Our numbers are very close, but I haven't the luxury of space to build it, so I'll be enjoying it by proxy through you.

3	Enjoy!

3	*y*

2	xwingyoda, on Sep 27 2007, 11:18 AM, said: what what what >:-( Have you stopped your medication once again X-D No actually I?m out of fly agaric.

2	But now it?s that seasson to go out in the forest and refill the stock of those babys.

2	Vikings On!

2	!

2	Wow that box is big but i somehow thought it would be even bigger, still it looks like for once lego are actully using all the space inside and not just a fraction like with other sets.

2	Cant wait to see more dunamis.....you lucky megablok ;-)

3	What a wonderful idea, and how nice from you.... *sweet* And.... Go, Killer, Go!

3	!

3	Thats awesome man!

3	Lucky that you got it!

3	I want it so badly... and it has a huge box too!

2	*yoda* Interesting question regarding the size of the box vs. the ISD.

2	Here ya go: Also, I'll be posting more on the size of the manual a little later.

2	I'm going to be building for the next few hours... *sweet*

1	Tks for that comparison pic Dunamis ;-) OK the box is big !!

1	I pictured it a tad smaller though !!

1	I know what I don't like, its the fact that it has the regular Lego Star Wars logo on top with Vader.

1	UCS sets should have a different iconography like they did in the past.

1	Sure its a trivial detail but it adds to the fact of owning something special !!

1	After all its the most expensive set ever as of now ;-) Happy building !!

1	And we'll wait patiently for some cool pics later on :-P *yoda*

3	The Manual: The gigantic manual measures 17?

3	x 12?

3	and is almost an inch thick.

3	It is spiral bound with a cardboard like front and back and it is 314 pages.

3	Interesting decision not to break it up into multiple manuals.

3	It is almost unwieldy at this size and thickness.

3	Unfortunately, the manual is not available electronically from the LEGO website.

3	Hopefully, it will be soon.

3	Missing were the little instructions at the beginning telling you to not build this beast on shag carpet and to sort out the 5,000+ pieces before you get started.

3	I guess they figure if you got $500 to spend on this thing, you can build it however you want.

3	As usual, we get the regular LEGO manual features: - Piece call outs for each step - Parts inventory at the end of the manual - Page numbers - Photos of all the other 2007 sets at the end of the manual Manual (paperback book provided for scale) Various manual photos (8x8 plate provided for scale) I'm about 2 hours into building and sorting.

3	I'm trying to stay a day ahead in my posting.

3	The build has been easier than I thought so far.

3	Despite the massive number of pieces, it has not been too hard to sort and find what you need.

3	Build photos will start appearing in tomorrow's entry.

2	Very expecting indeed.

2	Waiting for your kind photo ... :-)

1	My gawd that manuel is huge!!!!!

1	That's enough to put a sane man off of buying this set.......Thank gawd none of us are sane thats all i can say X-D Just how many technic pins does this monster need???

1	8-?

1	Judging by that one pic theres gotta be a lot in this set.

3	Wow I never thought I'd be impressed by a box but I certainly am now.

3	Any chance of seeing all 5000 bricks in a big pile?

3	Vader, on Sep 28 2007, 10:14 AM, said: My gawd that manuel is huge!!!!!

3	That's enough to put a sane man off of buying this set.......Thank gawd none of us are sane thats all i can say X-D Too true, never had I imagined thinking about buying a ?350 Lego set before....Christmas is soo close yet soo far.

3	Nice idea, reviewing the set while constructing it.

3	This is the top of the bill for any lego-collector (also financially speaking..) and I like the look of all those thousands of pieces.

3	The manual is incredible, I thought I had a really thick manual coming with set 8479, but this one exceeds it with ease... Review on!

2	xwingyoda, on Sep 28 2007, 07:34 AM, said: Tks for that comparison pic Dunamis ;-) OK the box is big !!

2	I pictured it a tad smaller though !!

2	*yoda* I don't have the UCS ISD but from the pic i can see that it is about the same thickness, slightly shorter but much wider than the MF.

2	So this leads me to believe that dimension-wise the UCS MF is more compact.

2	Also, notice how in the content, the parts fit in just nice without additional spare space for anything else.

2	Strange isn't it that when TLC is responsible for the shipping, we see optimum usage of box spaces.

2	X-D imagine if all boxes were this efficient.

2	$4.99 sets would be no bigger than a match box!

2	X-D X-D the MTT would be reduced to 1/4 its current size!

2	X-D X-D X-D

3	good review.

3	*y* Me, I can't build it before Saturday.

3	:'-(

3	Great review so far!

3	I am looking forward to additional posts!

3	As for the number of pins - from the Peeron inventory for the set, there are over 400 technic pins of various lengths!

3	(insert the "my fingers hurt from building" emoticon) Keep the pictures coming!

3	The Build: The build is going quicker than I thought.

3	I am sorting as I open the bags that I need.

3	Some bags are in multiples so it is easy to pick them out.

3	The build is a tad repetitive as the framework of the ship is somewhat symmetrical.

3	Here are some progress shots: Note that two plates (1x4 and 1x8) are stacked in between Technic beams.

3	Then the part below is assembled to hold the structure together.

3	This took about an hour of sorting and building: I'll post another update tomorrow.

2	The Minifigs: As you can see, the minifigs are really nice.

2	They even throw in an extra fleshie head!

2	No doubt these will fetch quite a bit on the Bricklink and Ebay markets.

2	I?m keeping mine.

2	Continuing the Build This photo shows how well this model is put together.

2	Notice that they use four of the three-hole beams per side to hold this together.

2	I remember reading that you can hang this model from the ceiling.

2	I don?t doubt it.

2	These right angle Technic pieces are used to reinforce the structure of the model.

2	You can see them used here: I was shocked at how many light gray plates are in this set.

2	I have TWO tubs full of these: The infrastructure is now complete: I got hung up for about an hour looking for one of these: Turns out, LEGO gave me an extra left wedge and shorted me a right wedge.

2	So frustrating!

2	I had to stead one off my 6211 Star Destroyer.

2	It is not a very common piece by the way?

3	Hey nice review, im up to about the same point as you (page 70 to be exact) , tho i didnt have that missing piece thankfully!

3	I think lego have done a much better job at packing the lego this time, i remember it taking me much longer to find pieces on the UCS ISD build

2	So I see they even do mistakes on these |-/ That beast looks really sturdy !!

2	That is great !!

2	Are these yellow parts new ?

2	I am not a Technic fan and never saw these before.

2	Another question for you: is the instruction book easy to follow, especially regarding the colours.

2	Does the black rally stands out comparing to the dark bley and so on ?

2	I sure hope so ;-) Can't wait to see moer hehe *yoda*

2	xwingyoda, on Sep 30 2007, 11:57 AM, said: Are these yellow parts new ?

2	I am not a Technic fan and never saw these before.

2	You don?t have the building crane 7905 either?

2	Same color, same shape there: piece no.

2	32555 (four of them included) I assume you?re not a town fan?

2	:-P ;-)

3	I have been taking photos for this review for a few months and I finally took the rest of the photos last night.

3	All the parts.

3	If you want tan, this is the set to get!

3	Main model.

3	The garage is a great addition... ...but the car only just fits!

3	The main house is very nice looking.

3	The windows extend to the sides... ...but not the back.

3	The chimney and drainage work very well, and I love the "basement".

3	I think the front works very well.

3	When I was making this I was multitasking doing weight training; do a set, do a step, do a set... and I ended up missing one of the row paths.

3	I discovered this after I finished the basement.

3	:-| The removable roof reveals BYO floors.

3	Probably why this is called a Model house!

3	The roof was quite interesting to build.

3	This is my first large house set so it all was very new to me.

3	I love the garage door.

3	More nice pipework.

3	This photo I mis-focused but there isn't much to see anyway!

3	The door is a nice touch.

3	The grill to the right on both sides is not just decoration as it hides the hinges for the door.

3	I also made one of the sub-models.

3	I was considering keeping this but I decided against it.

3	Once again the sides have windows... but the back doesn't.

3	The truck is there to make the photo more worthwhile!

3	The roof to this one doesn't come off easily as all the tiles are used for the front.

3	Just to clarify; these houses aren't attached so you can arrange them however you want.

3	The fronts are quite elaborate and it seems that Lego were trying to make this almost like a simpler market street.

3	The truck is too small for a minifig... ...but it probably was my favourite car.

3	Thoughts I highly recommend this set.

3	In most countries it is good value for money, including Australia.

3	The design is excellent and three instructions are included.

3	(The third is a school.

3	If anyone has made it and wants to post photos feel free!

3	At least one person at EB has made it.)

3	I love how each house has its own car.

3	Due to the way the primary model is made it is a bit weak at the corner, but that was a design choice.

3	My only real complaint about this set is how Lego is going though a mould transition and thus some roof slopes are rough, others are smooth.

3	I can accept either, and Lego has been moving to smooth slopes for years now, but to have a set with about 50/50 is annoying.

3	(The MTT was the same.)

3	But that is my only gripe with this excellent set.

3	*wub*

3	Thanks for the review, and tons of pics!

3	I've been wanting to pick this one up since I saw it.

3	I thought the 4956 Creator House was nice, but this Model Town House is in a completely different league!

3	I also like the alternate models that you can see in the catalogues.

2	Thank you for the review Sinner.

2	At first I wanted this set for the 4 blue 1x1 slope tiles, but I can see there is much more into it than that.

2	It sure is a great value compared to what you get in the Building Bonanzas (no cars and less detail).

2	It was funny to see the little side story in your pictures.

2	Would it be hard to modify the cars to fit minifigs better?

3	A beautiful and humorous review with very fine pics.

3	*y* A fantastic set, full of neat details and in a wonderful color scheme.

3	Great for every City builder for sure.

3	I guess we waited for sets like that.

3	We dreamed about them.

3	I?m glad we got them now.

3	:'-) EDIT: Congrats!

3	It seems you?ve got your bucket back.... :-P

2	I found the use of parts well done by the designers.

2	I made a car and then tried to make a house from a different instruction book.

2	I could not as several pieces were already used in the car.

2	Nice to see them using all the parts like that rather than having a lot of "extra" bits.

2	Moral of the story: one instruction book at a time.

2	*sweet*

2	I was all for the white house until I saw this set.

2	I still wouldn't mind it though.

2	:-D Lasse D, on Sep 28 2007, 08:03 AM, said: Would it be hard to modify the cars to fit minifigs better?

2	The problem with the blue truck is a lack of headroom.

2	However the truck is quite low and I can't see it being too hard to change and still have it looking good.

3	Luckily you have two cute little friends and one beautiful lady to help you out!

3	:-P I likewise love *wub* this set and your review does it credit!

3	I laughed outloud a lot as I read it.

3	I especially love you trying to look through the windowless back :-D :-D :-D Great job, now sort that out and start building for our competition!

3	X-D

3	Excellent review with great pics and cameo appearances by some of our EB favs *y* Definitely a set that was on my 'to get' list already, and this only confirms that.

3	Might make me want two, just because I love tan so much and I'd like to see if something could be done to bulk up that car.

3	Great job as always!

3	:-)

3	Thank you very much for the review Sinner.

3	I definitly *wub* this set.

3	This will make a great addition for us "Townies".

3	I thought the size was too small.

3	I plan to make my house fit practically the whole baseplate.

3	Plus I will definitly add floors, that looked :-D .

3	I can't believe TLC skimped on the floors.

3	Thanks for this review Sinner!

3	I love this house, with the nicely made tiled corners, the colorscheme and the garage.

3	The only thing I dislike about this set is the way the windows are attached in train windows (so they turn inwards a little) instead of the usual frames with shutter-attachment-ability.

3	But that is something that can be fixed in the blink of an eye.

3	I will certainly buy this house some day when I find it at reasonable price.

3	Thanks for the review Sinner!

3	*y* ... although we had a not very detailed one already... :-P I bought this set at TRU with 20% off resulting in 54?.

3	X-D Definitely a must buy for every townie.

3	You get tons of useful parts to build other buildings as well.

3	[shameless self-promotion /OFF] ;-) You have to love tan bricks though.

3	8-| MOC ON!

1	I too have bought this set and the only thing I notice which is a bit odd, with the exception of there being no floors in the house is the lack of a steering wheel in the car!

3	Thanks for the review Sinner!

3	I definitely want this set now.

3	The mixed rough and smooth roof bricks would annoy me on a model like the MTT, but here it looks as is if the roof is quite old with some parts being worn and pitted and some parts being replaced with new roof tiles.

3	I quite like the effect.

3	I agree on which is the best vehicle, and if it doesn't fit minifigs, just mod the heck out of it!

3	X-D

2	Thanks for the thanks guys!

2	X-D I started building today!

2	*sweet* MatthewUSA, on Sep 28 2007, 03:56 PM, said: I can't believe TLC skimped on the floors.

2	It didn't bother me as I downloaded the instructions prior to buying the set.

2	I think it was a deliberate choice to make the house flashy looking but not very functional.

2	Due to the cool looking corners it isn't very strong either; while breaking it I was reminded of a zip!

2	These were my first windows like that and it surprised me.

2	I wouldn't be surprised if Lego are trying to phase out the old windows.

2	*y* ... although we had a not very detailed one already... :-P I notice that, but since didn't show what the original set looked like I saw that more of a MOC.

2	8-| Holodoc, on Sep 28 2007, 07:58 PM, said: You get tons of useful parts to build other buildings as well.

2	[shameless self-promotion /OFF] ;-) I was actually considering adding a link to your MOC anyway.

2	Thanks!

2	What confuses me though is the (CG) cover has the rough ones shown... :-|

3	Sinner.

3	You have convinced me.

3	I bought this set yesterday when it was on sale at International LEGO weekend in Sk?rb?k.

3	Sweet!

3	Looks like an awesome set.

3	I might get it, I have to see.

3	Looks like it has a lot of good parts.

3	-ZotS

3	Thank you for the nice review.

3	I want this set too with al those tan bricks and black slopes and the cute blue car *wub* I like the old windows more, I hope they don't stop producing them

3	Sinner, thanks for this outstanding review!

3	I am glad that I had read this review in advance, before making my purchase on this set earlier with my girlfriend.

3	We built this set for a total of 3 hours, to complete this beauty, in about 2 hours ago.

3	There are stars circling around my head at this very moment, when I post this reply.

3	I must admit from the bottom of my heart, that this is an wonderful piece of house, that simply shows the beauty of it, with the European kind of houses, where there is a garage.

3	Furthermore, there is a lovely blue car.

3	I am seeing stars right now, in the middle of the night, and I must drop a thanks to you personally as well.

3	Although it is empty from its interior unlike the 4996 Beach House, but this set has the majestic look which simply place a "Wow" factor in front of it upon completion.

3	At the moment, we had plans for getting the second set next month, to build the other design as well.

3	Hopefully, I will be able to share with you guys, all of my different Creators sets, with its alternate designs as well in the near future.

3	Nice pictorial review, I always like this little set !

3	A little more text would have been nice but that is ok as it is .

3	PS: You should have mentioned in the title that this topic is picture heavy - I was wondering why it was loading so slow on my mobile

2	Hi, You've done well on the pictures!

2	But I agree with Freekysch; a little more text would be great.

2	Ever thought about joining the Reviewer's Academy?

2	Thanks for comments.

2	I know about text, I'm trying to write more, but haven't succes in this yet.

2	I thought about joining Reviewers Academy, but I'm not sure because I have only maimum 4(may be 5) hours each time when I can make review or something that needs some hours.

2	Writing a decent review will indeed take some time.

2	But you don't need to do it in a single session.

2	If "each time" is 4/5 hours, you can write a review in 2 x "each time"

3	i actually bought this set last Monday as it was reduced to 14.99.....it actually not a bad little set considering the size and part count, has a decent array of functions.

3	its a nice little set....the B model looks just as good so i might buy a second set, as you get the bucket left over and i need that bucket for another set.

3	Edited by Richard Dower, 19 October 2015 - 04:42 PM.

3	Remember when I said in my review of 7090 to expect a review after I went to ToysRus?

3	Well, somehow things didn?t work out, but fortunately I?m finally reviewing my latest purchases, starting with 7091 Catapault Defense, which happens to be one of the best sets in the Castle line.

3	The Box and Instructions: Lego box art is at it?s highest point ever these days, with lots of special effects and great action poses.

3	The castle theme is no exception, and 7091 isn?t either.

3	I?ll let the box speak for itself: I love the back of the castle boxes as well, since they give another action scene and other neat info like a layout of all the accessories.

3	The Contents: Only the bare essentials as usual: piece bags and instructions.

3	I seriously wish they still put mini catalogs inside sets like they did when I was young, but I guess they are too expensive to make or something.

3	Ah well, can?t have everything.

3	No picture of the instructions this time, but since that isn?t necessary I?ll just say that they are fine, and do not have a problem with distinguishing dark gray from black.

3	The Pieces: Here?s your basic shot of every piece included, minus a few extra pieces like an extra Viking horn and black skeleton leg.

3	Not too shabby for a 10 USD set.

3	There?s a lot of nice pieces in 7091, as you can see (and this doesn?t include the accessories or minifig parts!).

3	The brown plates, wheels, and spoked things are always useful, and the dark blue and gold slopes are really cool.

3	However, there?s also a fair amount of technic in here, so be warry.

3	As usual for the castle line, 7091 has a heaping helping of accessories.

3	Most of them are old pieces recolored, but the ball on chain (what?s the actual name, could someone tell me?)

3	and the shields are brand new.

3	I actually like the new skeleton weapon, since it?s fairly detailed and was really the only way TLC could make a part like that.

3	And yes, the shields ARE printed (quite nicely too, if I do say so myself).

3	Plus, you get Viking horns (always useful to have), a grey boulder, a basket, and 3 helmets.

3	Not a half bad deal, eh?

3	Oh, who am I kidding ?

3	it?s awesome!

3	Minifigures: Ah yes, one of the highlights of any castle set.

3	You get 2 soldiers and 2 skellies this time, all with different weapons.

3	The two soldiers are just regular Crown troops with different faces ?

3	nothing special, except that they are awesome anyway.

3	The skeletons on the other hand are much more interesting: an archer and a black skellie!

3	Archers cool, of course, but I know many don?t like the printing on the black skeletons.

3	Well, let me say that I don?t mind it so much.

3	The only real problem is that the eyes are dark red instead of just red, which makes the printing a bit less noticeable.

3	And I?ve been through it before that the new skeleton molds in general don?t bother me at all ?

3	go skeletons!

3	The Finished Set: Alright, there?s two builds in this set, and I?ll start with the smaller: the skeleton barricade.

3	Okay, so it?s nothing special, but it?s cool all the less.

3	The shield on the front and the slanted spears are nice touches.

3	Here?s just how the skeletons can tower over their own barricade: with a little step.

3	Ah, the catapault.

3	The lovely catapault.

3	Seriously, I love TLC?s design.

3	Very effective, and also very realistic, especially compared to KK.

3	Love the side details and the swiveling base, and you gotta love the clever use of that basket.

3	Playability: Yes, I?ve made it a tradition now to write stories for any castle set I buy (and this isn?t the last one, you can be sure of that!).

3	Here?s one featuring everything in 7901: Oh, and here?s a small ship I made out of all the pieces in this set plus a couple extra figures and weapons from my copy of 7901.

3	Not half bad, IMO, considering what I had to work with.

3	Overall Rating: Presentation: 9/10 Pieces: 8/10 Minifigures: 9/10 Finished model: 9/10 Playability: 8/10 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Final Score: 8.6/10 Once again, I highly recommend the reviewed set.

3	Castle is possibly the best theme this year, and this set is one of many that prove it.

3	As with all castle sets, it?s best if you buy several if you want to truly enjoy it, but this set alone is also impressive in both design and pieces and minifigures.

3	Get at least one if you have even a slight liking for Castle.

3	Very nice review!

3	Seems like I'll be getting my first Castle set soon.. *wub* Grevious, on Oct 10 2007, 09:33 PM, said: Most of them are old pieces recolored, but the ball on chain (what’s the actual name, could someone tell me?)

3	That would be a flail.

3	;-)

3	Wow thanks for the review!

3	8-?

3	I already have the other two set (theyre fantastic *wub* ) and i know ill be getting this one soon!

3	DP8

3	Very nice review!

3	I like the amount of pics and that alternate model.

3	I wouldn't have thought of making a ship from those parts, I once made a larger, Crownie-ized skellie barrier instead.

3	A very nice review with good, although perhaps a little too big, pictures.... *y* Now I realized that this catapult?s able to swivel, that?s neat, thank you!

3	X-D

3	The pictures really tell all, nice review Grevious!

3	I especially liked the story, great sense of humor!

3	Thanks for this nice review.

3	Nice comics presentation, too.

3	*sweet* Makes me want to get some new Castle sets even harder, now.

3	:-$

3	Thanks for the review Grevious!

3	I already have this set, but I loved your comic and that nice alternate model!

3	*y* TTFN!

3	>:-)

3	That was a fun review, I picked up a couple of these on holiday in France and it was one of the main reasons I went all-out and bought the rest of the Castle range!

3	Dr. S.

3	So far of this line i have 7009 and 7090 you have now convinced me to get this one also nice review btw i think the name for it is mace

3	Great review Grevious!!

3	*sweet* *y* Nice job, thanks for sharing.

3	Great comic and I especially love that you gave us an alternative model, something LEGO neglects to do anymore... |-/ Thanks again!

3	*wub*

3	That's a superb review if I ever saw one, and another great story!

3	*y* It's a good review even though I got the set 4 months ago.

3	:-P This just reinforces my like for it.

3	:-P

3	Thanks for the review, the comic was great!

3	:-D Your alternate model is great as well, I would never have thought of building a ship out of a catapult!

3	:-P

3	Great review, this is one of my favorite sets from the new castle line.

3	It's simple and yet so effective, oh and great comic you have there *y*

3	Excellent review!

3	Showed everything in detail then added a fun twist at the end.

3	Another set I pretty much knew I needed to buy is confirmed.

3	*y*

3	nice review *y* the comic is very funny :-D i don't have this set 8-| but i'm going to buy it soon.

3	Thanks everyone for all the comments!

3	;-) My next review is most likely going to be the Toa Mahri I bought a long time ago; I also typed up a review for her but haven't bothered posting it!

3	Ah well, I'll get it up eventually.... X-D Edit: Gah!

3	I just realized how many posts I had!

3	Better post something else on the boards quickly.... :-P Edited by Grevious, 11 October 2007 - 08:45 PM.

3	LOL what a review!!!

3	I love the story ^_^

3	Ah yes, the good ol' Catapult Attack.

3	Nice review, and what a great comic, I loved it.

3	*y* :-D You've inspired me, all I need now is a camera!

3	:-P Great job, keep up the good work, and I'm looking forward to more reviews!

3	*y* ~Peace Edited by iamded, 12 October 2007 - 10:30 AM.

3	nice review, I like this set alot.

3	*y* :-)

3	Great review!

3	*sweet* I wasn't aware that the catapult rotated either...

3	This set isn't on my buy list though as it is all more of the same for me.

3	Thanks for the cool MOC!

3	:-D I always plan to add a MOC to my reviews but I always run out of time.... :'-(

3	:-D I always plan to add a MOC to my reviews but I always run out of time.... :'-( True, there are too many catapults already, and in my opinion some with a better design as well.

3	But my lack of interest in this particular set doesn't reflect at all on my opinion of this review, which I enjoyed very much!

3	Please continue making great reviews like this one Grevious.

3	*y*

3	i just got this today.

3	It is amazing like my other two castle sets: the joust and the crossbow.

3	I am currently starting to save for 2008 but for Christmas i think i want the Skeleton Carridge and the Naboo N-1 Fighter.

3	It's that time of year again when the days get shorter, the nights get colder, and children all around the world stare longingly into warmly lit toy shops and prepare their wishlist to send to Santa.

3	This is also the time when The Lego Group releases their latest Winter Village set which has been an annual tradition for the past seven years.

3	These sets have been very popular, especially among AFOLs, and are always highly anticipated.

3	However, while some entries in this series have been more popular than others, none has been as controversial as this year's set, the Winter Toy Shop, which is a re-release of the first Winter Village set, 10199 Winter Toy Shop from 2009.

3	It seems that many think that this set didn't need to be remade and would have preferred a new set instead, or that it is not different enough from the original and will be redundant in a completionist's collection.

3	Does it deserve all the hate?

3	Let's find out.

3	Disclaimer: I don't own the 2009 version, so I can't compare them visually, but I will do my best to let you know what is different in this version.

3	If you do need a visual reference, you can refer to Svelte's excellent review of the original.

3	Set Number: 10249 Name: Winter Toy Shop Theme: Creator Year of Release: 2015 Pieces: 898 Minifigs: 8 Price: £59.99 / $79.99 / 69.99€ S@H description: Quote Welcome to the Winter Toy Shop!

3	The holiday season has arrived and the toymaker is busy finishing off his latest creations!

3	Outside, children ski and snowboard, and a freshly built snowman sparkles in the light that shines from the toyshop tower.

3	Help decorate the huge tree that stands at the center of the square, play with the curious kitten on the cozy wooden bench or join in with the carolers beneath the ornate streetlamp.

3	This charming set also features a ladder, trees in various sizes, jack-in-the-box, a toy biplane, helicopter, rocket, train, race car, truck, robot, tugboat, teddy bear and a wrapped gift.

3	Have fun building this enchanting winter wonderland!

3	Includes a snowman and 8 minifigures with assorted accessories: a male caroler, female caroler, a woman, 2 men, 2 boys and a girl.

3	S@H Bricklink Brickset The Box The box art of this set is similar to that of the original, but there are some notable differences.

3	The Christmas tree is on the right side of the image this time while the park bench is on the left and of course it features this year's design for Creator boxes with the dark blue stripe along the right side and the "Expert" logo in the top right corner.

3	There's also a small picture of the back of the toy shop and the background looks less cartoony than on the original.

3	The back is also very similar, showing a different angle of the toy shop along with some close-ups, although this time there is no minifig lineup.

3	Instead, the minifig lineup is on the right side of the box.

3	It also includes the accessories that each minifig comes with and some of the toys.

3	On the left side of the box there is a thumbnail of the box art and the set name in six different languages.

3	They also want to make sure that you know that there are batteries included by saying it in dozens of languages.

3	The top of the box features the inventory and a 1:1 scale reference with the female caroler.

3	On the bottom there is a picture that reminds you that there is a light brick included in this set, in case that wasn't clear from the front of the box, and it confirms that yes, it is a bad idea to put it in water, in case you were planning to go swimming with your Winter Toy Shop.

3	The Contents Inside the box there are two instruction booklets and two groups of bags, one for each instruction booklet.

3	While two groups of bags is not as many as there usually are in other sets of this size, it's still better than the first version of this set where the bags weren't numbered at all, so this makes the build a bit easier.

3	The large bag in Group 1 and the two large bags in Group 2 have a white stripe going down the middle of the bag and only have one group number printed on it along with some other number and some kind of scan code.

3	I have no idea why they made this distinction for these bags or what that code is for, so if any of you know the purpose of this, please let me know in the comments below.

3	Here is a random instructions page.

3	As you can see, the building steps can get quite challenging as they sometimes include many different pieces in one step, especially when it uses a lot of brown pieces which are very dark and hard to see in the instructions, living up to the set's status as an expert-level set.

3	Most of the time, though, the instructions are pretty clear and easy enough to follow.

3	There are some parts in new colors in this set that weren't in the first version or any other set until now, such as that large, flat Technic arch in dark green, the jester hat in orange and blue, one of those new 2z2 round jumper tiles in brown, a golden frog(!

3	), and a snowboard in dark blue.

3	There are also some rare Friends parts that make their Creator debut here such as the skis in azure and that new clear 1x1 round tile with a tiny tube coming out of it which is usually used as a stand for Friends accessories and is a very useful piece, especially for SNOT techniques (and no, I'm not talking about the type of snot that many people usually have stuck in their nose around this time of year).

3	There are some printed parts as well, such as the clock tile, the letter tile, and the register slope like in the first version of the set.

3	We also get a new face print for the white cat which is more in line with other modern cat designs.

3	But the best part is the shop sign which is printed this time around.

3	It features a lovely wood pattern, the words "toy shop", and a toy soldier on both sides of the sign.

3	Which is ironic since the shop doesn't seem to sell any toy soldiers like this, but it looks so good on the sign that I won't sue them for false advertising.

3	The Minifigs Let's start with the most unique figures in this set, the carolers.

3	These two were also the highlight in the first version of the set, but in the original they both had the same head (this one -> ) which featured a very questionable facial expression that could easily be taken out of context.

3	In this version, they have unique faces which look much better and help distinguish their gender.

3	The male caroler uses Lord Vampyre's torso which looks quite snazzy on him.

3	Maybe this is Lord Vampyre before he became a vampire?

3	The female caroler is easily the best minifig in the set, though, because in addition to her exclusive head, she also gets an exclusive torso and skirt print!

3	A huge improvement over the generic unprinted one in the original.

3	She also gets the queen hair in dark brown and Aragorn's lined cape instead of two combined regular capes.

3	This set truly is the Return of the Queen!

3	The snowman is technically not a minifig, but as you can see here, he is exactly as tall as one and he is the first thing you build after the minifigs, so I included him here.

3	He has mostly the same design as before, except this time he has robot claws for arms instead of levers.

3	Which is good since they allow him to hold accessories such as his broom.

3	His carrot nose is included separately again.

3	The carolers both have back printing while the snowman looks no different from the back than he does from the front.

3	Here you can see the black side of the female's cape.

3	This lined cape is so much nicer than the solution they used in the original.

3	Next up we have what I assume is a married couple who are likely the parents of at least one of the kids, as well as the toymaker who I will call Geppetto.

3	The man in the pinstripe suit was not included in the first version of the set, so he's a bonus minifig!

3	These guys are fairly generic, but they have some detailed torso prints, so they look pretty nice.

3	Geppetto seems to have gotten younger since the release of the original set since his gray hair has now turned dark tan and he doesn't seem to need glasses anymore.

3	The men both have back printing, but the woman is the only one in this set who doesn't get a back print.

3	Why you gotta be so discriminating against women, LEGO?!

3	Last but not least, there are the kids.

3	One of the boys wears dark blue pants, a green jacket, and a wool cap.

3	He looks a bit like a lumberjack, so let's call him lumberjack boy, or Jack for short.

3	The little girl wears an outfit that wouldn't look out of place in the Friends theme with a lavender scarf and pants.

3	I'll call her Lavender.

3	The second boy is wearing an Octan jacket and a sports helmet which makes it ironic that he is the one not doing any winter sports on the box art.

3	I'll call him President Business Junior, or PBJ for short.

3	All of the kids have fairly detailed back printing which makes up for the fact that much like the adults, they are made out of mostly common parts.

3	PBJ's helmet and scarf cover up the back of his head nicely which is important as you will see in the next picture.

3	What's also great about these figs is that half of them have a double-sided head.

3	Here you can see PBJ doing his best Macaulay Culkin impression.

3	I also removed his scarf so you can see the printing on his torso better.

3	But he's not the only one who seems to be easily scared.

3	The mother also has a very alarmed expression.

3	Maybe she got surprised by the Jack-in-the-box or maybe she just realized how expensive toys are nowadays.

3	You can see the female caroler's back printing here.

3	Her alternate expression is a non-singing face which is very nice to have and I wish the male caroler could have one too.

3	She looks quite cute with those rosy cheeks.

3	But the most adorable out of all of them has to be the little girl.

3	She comes with a pouting sad face that will melt your heart.

3	Please, don't cry!

3	I'll buy you any toy you want, just stop looking at me like that!

3	The Build The first half of the build is dedicated to the surroundings of the toy shop.

3	It includes the Christmas tree, the park bench, the snowman, the toys, the carolers, Jack and Lavender.

3	The large bag contains two smaller bags with small pieces, a white box that contains the caroler's cape, and the jester hat in its own little bag.

3	The first thing you build after the minifigs and the snowman is the toys.

3	This version of the set has a lot more toys than the original which is good because I always felt that the first Toy Shop was a bit light on toys.

3	Also, the ones that were in the original have been updated.

3	For example, instead of the two pairs of skis, you now get one pair of skis that use the new ski mold and a snowboard.

3	The Jack-in-the-box is mostly the same, except it now has an orange and blue color scheme instead of the red and blue from the original.

3	This change was probably not necessary, but hey, at least we get a new jester hat out of it.

3	And instead of the brick-built teddy bear you get the new teddy bear mold.

3	I have mixed feelings about this change because I actually kinda liked the brick-built teddy design and using a specialized mold seems to be going against the spirit of Creator sets, but on the other hand I can't deny that the molded teddy looks better than the blocky old one.

3	Meh.

3	The new toys include a tugboat which has some rounded Technic pieces as its hull, a biplane, a rocket, a helicopter, and a truck that cleverly uses roller skates for its wheels.

3	These are all quite brilliant designs that feel like micro versions of Lego City sets and make a great addition to the set.

3	Here is a back view of some of the more complex models.

3	As you can see, the Friends accessory stand has been cleverly used to hold the biplane's fin in place and to provide a stand for the helicopter.

3	The Jack-in-the-box has a hinged lid.

3	The only thing that bugs me a bit is the T-piece on top of the helicopter that holds the rotor in place, but I can't think of any better way they could have done it.

3	Next is the ladder that is used to decorate the tree which is exactly the same as the first version.

3	The supports are on a click-hinge, so they can be adjusted or folded away.

3	Then, you build the tree itself.

3	You begins, of course, with the stand which is mostly the same design as before, but this time the plates at the bottom are brown instead of white and have golden studs as feet.

3	Next, you build the first layer of branches.

3	The main difference in this version of the tree is that this one actually has a brown stem rather than just a Technic axle on which you stack the layers of branches one by one.

3	You wont be able to see the stem in the final result, but I like this change as it makes the tree more realistic.

3	Then you add the second layer of branches.

3	This one doesn't have lights/candles and attaches to the lower layer at an angle using the four trans-yellow studs close to the stem.

3	The third layer is added.

3	This one has lights again.

3	Each layer is similar in that they are all made out of green plates that are built around a 4x4 ring plate, but they get smaller each time and are constructed differently enough for the build not to feel repetitive.

3	With the addition of the fourth layer, we get close to finishing the tree.

3	Lastly, you add one more layer and the tip of the tree.

3	Now it's time to decorate the tree!

3	However, it's not as fun as it sounds since that requires you to add lights to the two chains/ropes first which can get a bit repetitive.

3	The clips holding the lights to the chain were white, but this time they're pearl gold which looks much nicer in my opinion.

3	The next part of the build is the park bench with the streetlamp and the little tree.

3	This is a fairly quick build with not much to it.

3	The fishbowl helmet parts are a useful piece that you don't see too often, so it's nice to get them again in this remake.

3	The design is pretty much the same as in the original set except for the wreaths on the streetlamp which use a green life preserver instead of a round 2x2 plate.

3	This is another instance where they use a specialized piece instead of a brick-built solution, but I'm okay with that because unlike with the teddy bear, this part was not originally intended to be a wreath, so it's still nice part usage.

3	The second half of the build is dedicated to the toy shop itself and includes the couple, Geppetto, and PBJ.

3	Please note that there is a fourth 6x10 plate burried under the parts.

3	You begin by tiling the floor, setting up the walls, and adding the interior items such as the fireplace, the cash register, and the toy displays.

3	Next, you add the walls, windows, and the door and the ground floor of the shop is finished.

3	So far, the build is the same as the old toy shop, except this time they decided to have the white stripes on the marquees be the longer ones instead of the dark red ones for some reason.

3	I don't know why they did this and kinda would have preverred to get dark red 1x1 plates instead of white, but it doesn't detract from the look of the shop, so I don't really care.

3	Now we begin with the upper floor.

3	This is where things start to look a little different.

3	Can you tell the difference?

3	The difference is that this time they attach the roof using clip-hinges instead of bulky Technic constructions which gives you more space on this floor and allows it to look more like an actual attic.

3	They even tile the floor next to the frog clock.

3	Aftter adding the roof, the build is finished.

3	The main roof feels a bit loose since it's only attached to the building by one side.

3	I'm not sure if this was an issue in the old toy shop, but it's not a big deal.

3	I just wouldn't pick the set up by the roof.

3	What I do like is that they used double cheese slopes on the awning on the outer wall of the tower instead of singles which makes it a bit easier to build.

3	I like how the supports under the tower roof now match those of the main roof.

3	The wreaths have also been updated like the ones on the streetlamp.

3	And those Technic arches under the roof look a lot more like garlands now.

3	On the original, they were dark gray, so I didn't even know they were supposed to be garlands and assumed they were part of the architecture.

3	The shop sign looks a lot better now that it is printed.

3	The old one just looked like a white flag.

3	I also like how the small plates under the marquee give it a wavy look and they included two trees in different sizes on the right side of the shop.

3	The back is nice and open and allows you to see the rest of the toys, the robot, train, and race car, all of which have just as much of a simple and clever design as the other toys.

3	The clock looks much nicer with the new golden frog.

3	Because golden frogs make everything better.

3	Spare Parts There are quite a few small parts left over, including a roller skate and one of those Friends accessory stands which will come in handy.

3	The Complete Set Here you can see the full set together.

3	It looks quite nice and festive with all the little details and there are many scenes that you can play out with it: You can have the minifigs decorate the tree, have the kids play in the snow, have the carolers sing by the bench, have the toymaker build some toys in his workshop, or have the parents buy presents for their kids.

3	It's a festive, toy-filled Winter Wonderland!

3	The fireplace looks cozy and I like the brick pattern going up the chimney.

3	The entrance of the shop looks a bit empty aside from the cash register.

3	I feel like they could have displayed some more toys here, but oh well.

3	Being a set targeted at teens and adults, there aren't really any play features aside from the light brick which is attached to a hinge, so you can either activate it by pressing the button with your finger or tilting the brick upward so that the button is pressed against the roof.

3	However, since the roof is not connected in the middle and only attached on the sides, it tends to split open a bit when you do that, so I'm not sure if attaching the roof this way here was such a good idea.

3	Nevertheless, it looks quite nice when the light is lit.

3	Ratings Design: 5/5 - This set is as gorgeous as it was back in 2009!

3	The small updates that they made are mostly good ones, although the absence of a brick-built teddy is a bit disappointing and the new way the roof is attached, while not as bulky as before, makes the roof slightly unstable, but those are just nitpicks.

3	Build: 5/5 - There are some interesting building techniques here, such as those on the tree, the roof, and the toys.

3	The fact that the parts are only split into two groups and the part callouts can get fairly complex makes it a challenging, enjoyable build.

3	Minifigs: 5/5 - They did a great job updating the figs in this set.

3	While only 3 of the torsos in the original had any printing, all of the torsos have printing front and back in this set, even the skirt and cape of the female caroler.

3	You get two exclusive heads and half of the heads are double-sided, plus you get 8 instead of 7 minifigs.

3	You really can't ask for more in a Creator set.

3	Playability: 4/5 - This set is more meant to be displayed than to be played with, but there are plenty of things to play with if you want.

3	All the different minifigs, accessories, and set pieces make for endless possibilities for play.

3	It's especially fun to swoosh the micro vehicles around.

3	Parts: 3/5 - There are lots of good parts here.

3	Most of them are fairly common, but there are some rare parts and some even in exclusive colors.

3	Price: 4/5 - This set costs $20 more than the original, but considering that this set has nearly 900 pieces, including some rare and exclusive ones, as well as more minifigs with much better printing, I think $80 is still a fair price.

3	Overall: 5/5 - So what's my opinion of this set?

3	For a remake, I think it's great.

3	They managed to make a good set even better.

3	Are the changes minor?

3	Yes.

3	Are they an improvement?

3	Mostly, yes.

3	Were they necessary?

3	Perhaps not, but it's good that they made them instead of just re-releasing the exact same set.

3	So if you didn't get the first Winter Toy Shop, I can highly recommend getting this one.

3	If you do already have the old version, this one might still be worth picking up for the hugely improved minifigs and rare parts alone.

3	As for the controversy over re-releasing the Winter Toy Shop, I can see where the haters are coming from, but I find their complaints to be quite petty.

3	I can understand if you're disappointed because you already have the first Winter Toy Shop and were looking forward to a new set this year, but there's always next year.

3	If you're a completist and feel like TLG is forcing you to buy a set you don't need, you're wrong.

3	Nobody is forcing you to buy anything but yourself.

3	If you decide to buy every set in a theme no matter what it is, that's your problem, not LEGO's.

3	So put down your torches and pitchforks and just be glad that they improved the set design and gave us another chance to buy this classic set.

3	There are far worse things that can happen in this world than Lego re-releasing one of their most popular sets.

3	Sorry for that little rant.

3	So what is your opinion on re-releases like this?

3	Please cast your vote in the poll above.

3	I hope you enjoyed this special Eurobricks Reviewers Academy review and would like to thank The Lego Group for the opportunity to review this set.

3	Happy Holidays everyone!

3	Bat-Toys by Okay Yaramanoglu, on Flickr

3	Thanks for a great review first of all.

3	I do like the upgrades and changes made from the original 2009 set, more colours and parts are offcourse available today than back in 2009.

3	It does look like a great set and i would really realy have loved to get it myself if i had the funds.

3	However their are so many other sets thats first priority for me this december and next year, so sadly i might have to pass on this if its not that i can get it redicioulusly cheap at some point.

3	And yeah, we should appreciate that LEGO does keep sets coming, even if its just upgrades from earlier releases.

3	Town is known for a new police and fire station every year, cant see why a new toyshop is so upsetting.

3	Once again thanks for a great review.

3	And happy holidays to you as well.

3	Nice to see they finally updated that generic screaming face from the 2007 Castle line.

3	Awesome review, Oky.

3	I have the old set so I won't be picking this up.

3	Great review.

3	You almost make me want to buy one.

3	I don't know what it is with these sets.

3	On the one hand they are so nicely designed and cute on the other side I never seriously consider buying one.

3	I can't explain what it is that holds me back.

2	Great review!

2	I just built the original, and this one has clear advantages over the original (though I wish Lego would stop putting torsos with defined breasts and curves on children).

2	I really like pretty much every change.

2	I won't be getting it, and I'd be lying if I said I'm not a little disappointed.

2	For the first four years, my mother-in-law got me the new winter village set for Christmas; after the last two, which didn't really fit thematically in my display, I had hoped for a new one--particularly since my daughter is getting to be around the age where she can play with them.

2	I mention her specifically because I've seen lots of people dismiss those who are a bit disappointed as rabid adults who don't care about kids getting cool sets, and I don't think that's fair.

2	I may have to see how much some of the parts go for on Bricklink.

2	The rerelease is better than the original, but not good enough that I'd want to spend $80 to get a set that's nearly identical to one I have.

2	A lack of money, maybe?

2	That's the thing that usually holds me back.

2	Anyway, I have the older version, so I am not interested in this set.

2	Great review, thanks Oky!

2	IMO, the only significant improvements over the 2009 version are the figures, toys, and printed shop sign.

2	As I already have the older one I'll have to give this one a pass.

3	Regarding the reason for the different designs on the inner bags, I think that the white stripe is the new version, with the non-stripe version being old.

3	I suspect the reason some sets have both versions is simply that they're still using up some of their supply of older bags.

3	Good review.

3	I didn't realise there were quite as many changes as you highlighted (tree, roof etc).

1	Thanks for the excellent review!

1	Unfortunately it only highlights how minimal the upgrades are (though they are nice).

1	Definitively a pass for me.

1	Let's hope LEGO does continue to make the more realistic winter village sets (versus Santa).

1	I'm not opposed to a rehash, the post office could use some improvements for example, but this one is just a wee bit minimal.

3	I missed out on the first one, but I love the improvements made in this version, like the tree having an actual brown trunk so it looks less like an artificial one, and the carolers as well.

3	I may pick this up, but I'm sorry to those of you who already have one.

3	I bought it and I'm very happy with it.

2	Cheers for putting up the review.

2	Some nice improvements, but not enough for me to pick it up.

2	The original set is good enough for me.

2	Pity the poll has no option "Yes, but only in addition to new sets, not in stead of new sets".

2	Edited by Withacee, 01 December 2015 - 09:38 AM.

3	Thanks for a nice review.

3	I am building it as we speak, and I like it so far.

3	Since I didn't have the old one, I can't complain.

2	Thanks for the review.

2	They definitely improved upon the original, but since I already own the original, I can't justify this set also, unfortunately.

2	It seems to be the trend.

2	But I'm sure there are a lot of first timers out there too that will snatch this up since it is a really lovely building.

2	And the updates make it better for sure.

2	Thanks Oky for this fine review.

2	I agreed with your sentiments on the unnecessary rants.

2	I also owned the 2009 version and even though there are minor improvements.

2	There must be a logical reason for its release again but is not entirely the same.

2	I felt is an excellent opportunity for others to acquire this design especially after six years ago.

2	As for myself, I will probably buy this if my spare funds allow me to own this set.

2	After mocking people for holding a particular opinion, you then turn around and ask people to express their opinion??

2	No thanks.

2	I guess I'll keep my opinions to myself.

2	I certainly don't want to be labeled a "hater."

2	Thanks for the kind comments everyone!

2	I like hearing your opinions on this set.

2	Withacee, on 01 December 2015 - 09:37 AM, said: Pity the poll has no option "Yes, but only in addition to new sets, not in stead of new sets".

2	I don't think that would be a realistic option as that would mean that they would have to spend twice the resources on this theme which I don't think they are ready to do, but if more people would like this option, I can add it to the poll.

2	I'm not mocking anyone.

2	I just think that some people need to calm down a bit and that TLG is getting more hate than they deserve for this set, but that's just my opinion and you're welcome to disagree with it.

2	Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, including you and me.

2	And yes, I would love to hear your thoughts on this matter because I would like to have a friendly discussion on this subject.

2	Oky, on 02 December 2015 - 12:49 AM, said: I don't think that would be a realistic option as that would mean that they would have to spend twice the resources on this theme which I don't think they are ready to do, but if more people would like this option, I can add it to the poll.

2	I know, but one can always hope, can't one!

2	I hope the WV theme will be continued in coming years with new sets, but given Santa's workshop and this re-release, I don't get my hopes up too much.

2	Time to get MOCing and reverse engineering!

3	I didn't own the original toy shop so I bought it this time around.

3	I just finished building it Saturday and I love it!

3	However, I wish they had both re-released this one AND came out with a new addition to the village.

3	:)

2	That's cool, and I appreciate that.

2	But, i would recommend avoiding the use of the word "hater" then.

2	That's a perjorative term that's loaded with negative connotation, as I'm sure you're well aware.

2	It's the flipside to me calling you a "mindless fanboy" or a "corporate shill."

2	Those aren't terms that invite friendly discussion.

2	They shut down discussion by belitting the other person's opinion, and implying that they lack the maturity or intelligence to think critically.

2	I don't actually care all that much about this set.

2	You just hit on a pet peeve of mine, is all.

2	And it's one that I see spreading throughout Eurobricks, which is a shame.

2	The use of terms like "hater," "whiner," or "fanboy" are becoming much too prevalent around here.

3	REVIEW - 42044 - DISPLAY TEAM JET INTRODUCTION The smallest of the 2016 sets, is the Display Team Jet.

3	It doesn't seem to have lots of functionality, but maybe the landing gear is retractable.

3	This set kind of reminds me to the 9394 - Jet Plane, although it's obviously a lot smaller.

3	As you can read in my review of the 42052 - Heavy Lift Helicopter basically anything flying is +1 for me, so let's find out if this set also fits the bill.

3	Note: All images can be clicked for hi-res versions.

3	SET INFORMATION Number: 42044 Title: Display Team Jet Theme: Technic Released: 2016 Part Count: 113 Box Weight: 193 gr Box Dimensions: 15,4 cm x 13,8 cm x 5,9 cm Set Price (MSRP): € 9,99 Price per Part: € 0,088 Links: Brickset, Bricklink THE BOX Being a small set, it obviously comes in a small box.

3	The Display Team Jet is an Aerobatics Jet, used in air shows.

3	On the box it's flying rather high, but at least it's at a safe distance from the crowd.

3	Front side shows the main model, together with a small section indicating you can use Digital Building instructions to build this model.

3	BACK SIDE The back side shows the B-model, a Stunt Plane.

3	And again a reference to the apps for Digital Building instructions.

3	More on the Stunt Plane later.

3	CONTENT OF THE BOX The box contains: 2 Instructions Booklets (A- and B-model) 1 Sticker Sheet 3 Technic Liftarms 2 Bags INSTRUCTION BOOKLETS Both the instructions for the A- and B-model are included in the box.

3	STICKER SHEET A lot of stickers for such a small set.

3	Apparently no panel is left untouched.

3	LIFTARMS Three liftarms unsealed, nothing out of the ordinary for a small set.

3	BAGS Two bags containing the rest of the parts.

3	HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This section describes the new and/or otherwise interesting parts.

3	YELLOW 5L AXLES The 5L Axle in Yellow has never been released before, so it's one of the new parts for this year.

3	BLACK 7L FLEX AXLES For the layman this seems a common part, but the 7L Soft Axle actually has never been released in black before.

3	Combined with the re-release of the 19L Soft Axle in black, this will open up lots of possibilities.

3	For those of you thinking you've read this text before; you are right, the new Drag Racer contains these new 7L Flex Axles too.

3	WHITE PANELS This small set comes with a whopping 10 panels.

3	Great for the ones who like panels.

3	Not so great if you think TLG is using too much panels lately.

3	RUDDER This part, the Small Bionicle Wing, is the same as the one used in last year's 42033 - Record Breaker.

3	PART LIST This set contains 113 parts, all listed below.

3	THE BUILD This is the collection of parts, used to build the Jet.

3	It sure looks like we are getting a landing gear.

3	The build is fun, but pretty straightforward.

3	There aren't any special or cool techniques used in this set.

3	It almost took me more time to apply all the stickers than to build the actual model.

3	FINISHED MODEL The finished Jet does look cool though.

3	The white and yellow color scheme, combined with the stickers, work really well.

3	I have seen people refer to the plane as being orange, but it's definitely yellow.

3	Technic (or LEGO in general) tends to have some color variation when it comes to yellow.

3	I do concur this is the warmer variant of yellow, but it's not orange.

3	The back of the plane looks nice too, although I am not a big fan of the rudder part.

3	It looks too detailed, compared to the other panels.

3	It's not a big deal though, and maybe it's just me.

3	PARTS LEFT Only three common parts left.

3	FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS This set has a single feature and that is a retractable landing gear.

3	It's operated by the black 12T Double Bevel Gear near the cockpit.

3	In the following picture you can see the landing gear retracted.

3	This image shows the landing gear when the plane is ready for landing.

3	Hopefully the pilot will roll the plane before landing, but you probably know what I mean VIDEO Here's s short video demonstrating the Display Team Jet.

3	B-MODEL This set also includes the building instructions for the B-model, a Stunt Plane.

3	The building experience for the Stunt Plane is more or less the same as for the Jet.

3	Well, what do you expect when both models are planes with a limited number of parts.

3	For an alternative model the Stunt Plane looks fine.

3	There's not a lot of functionality in this plane, but it's worth mentioning that the tail wheel allows the plane to roll on a flat surface.

3	The plane also has working propellors.

3	Both functions are demonstrated in the video.

3	Unfortunately, the landing gear of the Stunt Plane is not retractable.

3	PARTS LEFT A couple of extra leftover parts, but it's nice to see that most of the parts have been used in the B-model as well.

3	Actually, there's probably an extra yellow Technic Smooth 1/2 Bush left.

3	I just found it on my desk, but it could belong to one of the other sets.

3	VIDEO Here's a video demonstrating the Stunt Plane.

3	SUMMARY Two nice planes for 13 bucks, that's basically what you get.

3	Both models look good and the set has some interesting new parts.

3	Especially the 7L Flex Axle will be very popular.

3	It comes with a decent collection of white panel, although they are very common nowadays.

3	Both models have limited functionality, but each of them has at least one function to give the model some playability for kids, other than the swooshability that is.

3	Okay, it might lack some proper functions, but I still think kids will love this set.

3	I can see kids running around with one of the planes in their hands.

3	All in all I think this set delivers what you'd expect.

3	SCORE Let's see how this set flies!

3	Remember that the grades are based on it being a small set.

3	Obviously a set like this, cannot be compared with a Mercedes flagship.

3	8 DESIGN For a small set, the model looks very authentic.

3	7 BUILDING EXPERIENCE No surprises.

3	7 FEATURES Just the retractable landing gear.

3	8 PLAYABILITY It has swooshability, so I see kids running around with this model.

3	7 PARTS Lots of panels, if you are into that.

3	8 VALUE FOR MONEY Can't go wrong with these small sets.

3	7,5 FUN FOR KIDS More image can be found on my Flickr page.

3	Thank you for reading.

3	I hope you enjoyed it.

1	While I can see kids enjoying this, I'm not sure I would buy.

1	The flex axles are nice, and it is a decent number of white panels but I think I would get better return out of a larger parts set.

1	Fantastic review though, and your pictures show off this tiny model better than the box art does.

3	Very nice little set, and a lot of those new white small panels.

3	It's a need!

3	Thanks for the nice review!

3	The landing mechanism looks quite cute.

3	Aren't the yellow axles 5L, not 4L?

3	(Very strange that they would release such a part).

2	It says 5l in the parts list.

3	Love this model, awesome swooshability, interesting parts, and a nice little model to put on my desk at work :)

3	For 10 Euros very usefull parts.

3	I like it as well as other 2016 sets.

3	I like the gear retracting mechanism a lot.

3	Very good set for good price.

3	Thanx for good review.

3	:) Max

3	Hi there, nice model, great review!

3	I almost reverse engineered this model, but used wrong parts for landing wheels, didn't know how to fix the nose proper, and so on.

3	So i was very interested in this model and i like playing with it.

3	I love the reviews, but i think i have to mention, that the yellow axle must be a 5L!

3	The picture shows a 5L, and a 5L would fit the size of the model.

3	The cart has also a 5L in yellow.

3	What sitze is the yellow axle in this seit.

3	Really 4L as written in the text?

3	Greetings, Robert

2	I almost reverse engineered this model, but used wrong parts for landing wheels, didn't know how to fix the nose proper, and so on.

2	So i was very interested in this model and i like playing with it.

2	I love the reviews, but i think i have to mention, that the yellow axle must be a 5L!

2	The picture shows a 5L, and a 5L would fit the size of the model.

2	The cart has also a 5L in yellow.

2	What sitze is the yellow axle in this seit.

2	Really 4L as written in the text?

2	Greetings, Robert The picture of the manual says 4x 5L yellow axle, and that seems to line up with what im seeing in the pics as well So i assume the 4L is a typo

2	I seem to have been messing up Axle Lengths in various reviews It's indeed 5L.

2	My bad.

2	Thanks for pointing it out.

3	Very nice review for a nice little set!

3	I especially like the smoothness of operation for the retractable landing gear.

3	I don't like the lack of symmetry for the propeller of the B model though, but understand the alternative would be to add one extra small panel to the set, or skip two of them in the B model.

3	Good review, as always Jim When I first saw this set I thought that it would make a great parts pack for me, as that I have about 20 white pieces in my Technic collection (all from 42043) and this set has some really useful ones, all for a cheap price.

3	Those 7L flex axles will be extremely useful in my current build I'm doing

3	Nice review, even with the missing demonstration video of the A-model!

3	Looks like this is an excellent panel pack for the price, and those soft axles will go down a treat.

3	Will this set be the dark horse of 1H 2016...?

3	I am definitely getting set for the panels!

2	Jay Psi, on 02 December 2015 - 12:10 AM, said: Nice review, even with the missing demonstration video of the A-model!

2	Hmmm strange.

2	Let me fix that.

2	Fixed the video and fixed the stars in the voting.

2	Thanks for paying attention guys

2	Set is only interesting for the panels, that's all it is to me

3	I just built the A model, and I rather like it.

3	It is much bigger than it looks from the box - about 30 studs long.

3	There is only one function - the landing gear - but it works very nicely.

3	Apart from that, it's a very solid build, and achieves an elegant shape with an absolute minimum of parts.

3	I don't usually get excited about small sets, but this one appeals to me.

3	I like the feeling that every single piece has a purpose.

3	My favourite of the 2016 sets I've built so far.

3	I'd go so far as to say this is the best "budget" set in years.

3	I would have loved this when I was a kid ... great "swoosh ability" ?

3	?

3	Good to hear that, im gonna check the toy shops in my lunch break tomorrow, see if they got their shipment in yet, if they have, ill definitely buy one of these little sets

2	I got this little set for Xmas and I noticed all the gaps and decided to fix them, so here it is.

2	IMG_5344 by JJ2Sam, on Flickr First I added some beams to the wings and top to make it less hollow, second I put some navigation lights on it, I made the nose a bit wider and added a control panel, and lastly I changed out the landing gear wheels to more appropriate ones.

2	IMG_5349 by JJ2Sam, on Flickr More pictures are HERE

3	Thats a cool little mod, two small nigles though, 1, your navigation lights are flipped on the main wings, 2, the panels on the tail i *think* were supposed to be the intakes for the jet engine, by using them to close up the tail you've turned it into a glider Cant wait untill i find one of these on shelves!

3	So this set showed up in stores yesterday, and i immediately picked two up.

3	All in all it is a nice set, but it is slightly different from what i was expecting, the plane feels a bit "flat", pointy nose, wide bottom etc.. And while the panels work very well as wings, it feels a bit simplistic to just have single-part wings.

3	The stickers really work for it though.

3	Its a cracking set though, nice parts pack, and a nice model as well

3	Got this at the weekend, mainly for the parts, but built it first.

3	Agreed with other comments - awesome swooshability.

3	REVIEW - 42046 - GETAWAY RACER INTRODUCTION Starting with the 42010 - Off-road Racer and 42011 - Race Car in 2013, TLG released two sets in the first half of each year, using a pullback motor.

3	The pullback motor allows the model to be pulled back, followed by forward motion.

3	Usually there's no apparent relation between the two set, other than the ability to combine them into an alternate build.

3	This year there seems to some sort of Cops and Robbers scene going on.

3	A Getaway Racer and a Police Interceptor.

3	That can't be a coincidence.

3	Makes you wonder who will be victorious, the good guys or the bad guys.

3	Let's find out!

3	Note: All images can be clicked for hi-res versions.

3	SET INFORMATION Number: 42046 Title: Getaway Racer Theme: Technic Released: 2016 Part Count: 170 Box Weight: 302 gr Box Dimensions: 26,0 cm x 13,8 cm x 5,9 cm Set Price (MSRP): € 19,99 Price per Part: € 0,118 Links: Brickset, Bricklink THE BOX The box has the same dimensions as previous year's pullback motor sets.

3	In the lower right corner there's a visual explanation of the pullback mechanism.

3	The dark model with it's decals sure looks like a cool hot rod.

3	CONTENT OF THE BOX The box contains: 1 Instructions Booklet 1 Sticker Sheet 2 Technic Liftarms 1 Pullback Motor 3 Bags INSTRUCTION BOOKLET Just a single booklet.

3	Unfortunately no booklet for the alternate model.

3	STICKER SHEET The sticker sheet contains a lot of cool stickers with flames and skulls etc.

3	PULLBACK MOTOR AND LIFTARMS The pullback motor and two liftarms are found unbagged.

3	BAGS A total of three bags containing the majority of the parts.

3	HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This section describes the new and/or otherwise interesting parts.

3	Actually, this set is the only set of 1H 2016 which doesn't use any new parts, not even parts in a new color.

3	TIRES The Getaway Racer uses four low profile tires (Tire 37 x 22 ZR).

3	RIMS The rims are Wheel 30.4mm D. x 20mm in Pearl Gold, found in 12 other sets.

3	PANELS This set contains three #3 Panelsand three #4 Panels in black.

3	PART LIST This set contains 171 parts, all listed below.

3	THE BUILD This being a small model, I won't show any building steps.

3	Let's skip right to the finished model.

3	Below you can see the end result.

3	In my opinion the model looks great.

3	It's got that hot rod vibe going on and the stickers add darkness to the vibe.

3	Slight problem with this set is that it really needs the stickers to finish the look.

3	Otherwise it's quite dull, with black and dark grey liftarms and panels.

3	The rear view shows the pullback motor connected directly to the rear axle.

3	In this image you can also clearly see the exhaust pipes on the side, which are very well executed.

3	The 3x3 Technic Discs with stickers, used in the rim, result in only seeing a part of the rim.

3	This works very well with the golden rims.

3	The bottom view shows the chassis of the car.

3	Nothing really noteworthy, as you would expect from a pullback set.

3	VIDEO The following video gives you an overview of the finished model.

3	PARTS LEFT These six parts are left after building the model.

3	Seems about right.

3	FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS This being a pullback motor set, it only has a single feature.

3	The video below demonstrates the acceleration of the vehicle.

3	My girlfriend was kind enough to catch the model before it fell to the ground.

3	Or did it hit something before it fell to the ground?!

3	VIDEO This video shows the pullback functionality.

3	B-MODEL The alternate model is a combined build with the Police Interceptor, which you can see on the back of the box.

3	Unfortunately the instructions for the combined B-model are not included, so I didn't get a chance to build it.

3	This would make for a fun challenge, building the B-model without the instructions.

3	SUMMARY Pullback sets are not the most technically advanced models, so you can't expect any other functionality than hitting the walls in your house.

3	However, I think they are very appealing to kids.

3	The fact that this year's pullback sets form a duo adds to the fun.

3	In my opinion TLG hit the nail on the head with the Getaway Racer and Police Interceptor.

3	The Getaway Racer looks very badass, which is something you don't see every day in a Technic set.

3	SCORE How do I grade the bad guy in this year's duo.

3	8 DESIGN It looks so cool, but it does need the stickers.

3	7 BUILDING EXPERIENCE Nothing out of the ordinary.

3	7 FEATURES Limited to the pullback-and-drive functionality.

3	7 PLAYABILITY Combined with the Police Interceptor, kids will love it.

3	It does need it's Nemesys though.

3	7 PARTS Collection of common parts.

3	Gold rims could be interesting.

3	8 VALUE FOR MONEY Pullback sets always deliver a certain value.

3	7,3 HIT IT!

3	More image can be found on my Flickr page.

3	Thank you for reading.

3	I hope you enjoyed it.

3	I almost purchased this today because I like the wheel / disc combo so much.

3	Another great review Jim!

3	And again i love the model, those pearl gold wheels This one definitely goes on the "buy on sight" list

2	One hero will now have just enough of that pullback motor to create one ultimate machine, thanks to this.

2	Jim great reviews but can I suggest you one thing?

2	Take some pics before you apply the stickers....and some with the stickers on!

2	It helps to have a comparison!

2	You are right.

2	I came to the same conclusion when writing the review.

2	I tell you it doesn't look that good without stickers, but I don't have a picture to prove it.

2	To be honest; I compared it to the model posted in the 2016 topic a few days ago.

2	I applied the stickers before building the model, so I wasn't able to make a proper comparison.

2	I will keep it in mind for future reviews.

2	Thanks for the suggestion.

2	You're welcome!

2	I'm not a huge fan of stickers, for 2 reasons: I do re-use all the parts normally...and also I believe a model should look great even without stickers, then obviously they can be a plus, but only afterwords!

2	Anyway I'm enjoying the reviews as usual, and those pics Thanks for making them Jim!

2	!

2	Cool!

2	Glad you like 'em.

2	And thanks for the kind words.

1	Not sure what people like about this set, I think it's the worst of all 1H2016 sets.

1	Odd shape, bland colors, no new parts, and the windscreen isn't even closed.

1	But the reviews are great, indeed.

1	:)

2	are parts #62462 in Flat or Metallic Silver?

2	First thing I thought: HOT WHEELS??

2	WHUT.

2	The set looks like the Hot Wheels 'Bone Shaker'.

3	What a nice, tight an clean design!

3	Usually not too keen on the pull-back models, but this one is great.

2	the instructions for the Extreme Police Interceptor combo model is now online....will someone do a review of this B model?

2	You put a positive light on it whilst still being completely honest.

2	Thanks again for the review.

2	I am not sold on this one yet, but I confess it took about 2 years for me to finally appreciate 9396.

2	Maybe I need to see this in person.

3	Thanks for the review.

3	I wonder if the design inspiration came from the Russian Ka-32 helicopter.

2	I wonder if the design inspiration came from the Russian Ka-32 helicopter.

2	It sure seems that way.

3	Lego 42049 Mine Loader Thanks to Lego and EuroBricks for making this review possible!

3	This was supposed to be a preview-review, before the Dec 1 release date for the set, but it got stuck in customs or something and didn't arrive in time.

3	Well, I'd rather do a good, late review than a rushed review, so here it is.

3	Name: Mine Loader Set Number: 42049 Pieces: 476 (I think) Price: $39.99 (I think) Minifigs: 0 Theme: Technic Year of Release: 2016 Links: Bricklink Brickset The Box Another standard Technic box, not that there's anything wrong with that.

3	It is a littler weird that the mine loader is shown OUTSIDE the mine, but whatever.

3	The Back of the Box Again, very standard.

3	It's oddly technical, showing the exact angle of the machine when turning, but that's the sort of nerdy detail that Technic people like.

3	The alternate Mine Cutting Machine model looks interesting and unusual as well.

3	The 1:1 Part The 1:1 part on the top of the box is especially helpful with this set.

3	These mining machines are very oddly proportioned, since they need to fit in mine tunnels, so it's hard to judge the model size based on the wheels or seat like you can an ordinary set.

3	The Contents You get manuals for both models (a single book for the B and two books for the main), a medium size sticker sheet, 4 bags, and 4 loose tires.

3	The Special Parts This set has 4 of the new mudguard panels in yellow, two cylinder halves in red (a new color), some of the new color red and yellow axles, a couple of the new-ish Technic spacers, some of the axle-pin combination pieces, and a couple swords!

3	I'm pretty sure that's "an antenna" and a spare.

3	The Start of the B-Model Since I like the main model better, I'm building the alternate first, so that's how I'll write the review.

3	There's "power" for something (probably the engine) being taken off the one axle here.

3	Overall, a pretty standard Technic frame beginning with some structural beams, a frame, and using liftarms to support axles out to the sides.

3	More of the Frame The far end of the model has some obvious steering mechanism being formed, as well as a pivoting arm right in the center that's probably the connection from the Hand of God knob.

3	The Steering Yup.

3	Called it.

3	Oddly, there is a different turning radius between right and left right now.

3	I wonder if that'll get fixed... More Mechanisms That's looking more Technic now.

3	Sad to see a u-joint being used just as a fixed straight connection like that, but it is the alternate model...

3	The Engine Block Because all engines should be enclosed in a red cylindrical housing, am I right?

3	The Chassis It's definitely coming together now.

3	And yes, the B-model instructions tell you to put the stickers on.

3	It doesn't matter whether you build the main or alternate first, you'll get the stickers on (almost - there were a couple leftover that didn't get used in the B-model).

3	Almost Done With the rest of the body done and the wheels on, you really get the scale of this machine.

3	That blue seat is tiny compared to the rest of it!

3	And yes, the uneven steering lock got fixed.

3	After putting the wheels on, you add a couple of "pin with ball" pieces to the underside to restrict the steering.

3	They didn't do that at first so that you could turn the axles sharper while putting the wheels on, which made it easier to do.

3	The Grinder Keeping in mind the scale of the machine, this thing looks terrifying!

3	The tan gear at the back drives the spinning blade up front.

3	The red bushes near the turntable let you adjust the angle.

3	All Done The arm quickly attaches to the body and it's done.

3	Sadly, that tan gear doesn't connect to anything - it's just a knob so you can spin the blade by hand.

3	Raise Your Hand, If You're Sure... (I think I'm dating myself with that title...) This thing has massive reach.

3	I'm imagining this inside a mine, grinding away the rock overhead.

3	Pretty viciously effective machine!

3	The crank on this side of the model is used to raise and lower the arm.

3	Works well, and the grey spacer makes it nice to use since it spins freely.

3	The Leftovers Not much left for a B-model.

3	Nice usage!

3	Starting the Main Model The main model starts similarly to the alternate, with a frame, some axles, and a drive connection from one axle to something later.

3	Getting Complicated Already We're only a few pieces in and we already have three separate gear trains going on.

3	There's the axle driving the tan beveled gears inside the frame at the bottom.

3	There's more tan gears in the middle, and there's also a black gear sticking up as a knob that turns the grey connector in the center.

3	The Body is Done I skipped ahead quite a bit, but it was a bunch of standard Technic building.

3	You've got a fake engine with fan at the back, driven by one of the rear wheels, a knob sticking up for steering, and an axle coming forward to open and close the claw.

3	The Claw!

3	I like that they used a link system to open and close the claw instead of just gearing it.

3	The axle comes forward from the chassis (it's the red axle) with a couple u-joints for flexibility and drives a worm gear.

3	That rotates a gear below with a 2 stud liftarm on each side.

3	Those arms have pin with towball in them and then a link going from that short liftarm to the claw.

3	It's a small rotation of the liftarm, but makes the claw open widely and works very well.

3	Raising the Claw A few black liftarms join the claw to the body of the loader and allow it to move up and down.

3	It's a simple mechanism there - one yellow beam goes back and connects to a lever that lets you raise and lower the claw.

3	When raised (as shown), the lever locks in place by going just slightly past the centerline.

3	And It's Done Add some wheels, a cab, and some wheel arches and we're done.

3	It's a great looking machine, pretty unique, and looks like the real thing.

3	The main difference from reality is these usually have a scoop for moving loose rock.

3	Since we've had so many scooping vehicles in the past (tracked loaders, the Volvo L350F, excavators, etc) the claw here is a fun change and adds to the playability for kids.

3	Like the real thing, the body stays very low so the cab only has to stick up a little bit for the driver to see all around, because mines are cramped and busy areas.

3	From the Rear This angle is great.

3	I love the use of the new mudguard panels to make a nice curve to the back of the loader.

3	The antenna is a little weird, but perhaps they had a big pile of flat silver fencing swords to use up.

3	The black gear just to the left of the antenna is the claw control.

3	Rotating that gear opens and closes it.

3	The back end is a little lighter than a real machine would be, but Lego wanted to leave the engine exposed so you can see the cylinders moving.

3	The Conclusion So, what's my conclusion on this model?

3	I like it a lot.

3	It's simpler than a big set would be, but it's got lots of design and playability crammed in a mid-sized set.

3	It's a unique vehicle.

3	However, it does have a few flaws.

3	The steering on the main model needs some drag added.

3	As is, you basically have to drive by holding the steering knob since it'll bend if you push it from behind.

3	I don't like the use of pin with pin hole as mounting points for the orange and red trans plates for lights, since they can turn slightly and be at weird angles.

3	The antenna is unnecessary and in the way.

3	But none of these flaws are dealbreakers or even big deals.

3	They're minor.

3	The Ratings Value: 10/10 - Less than 10 cents a piece, lots of useful liftarms and such, nothing too weird or single-use.

3	Design: 9/10 - Looks very realistic for the size of the set, good functionality, not too dependent on stickers Minifigs: n/a - n/a Playability: 9/10 - Controls aren't perfect (loose steering, small knob for claw control) but very functional and cleverly done.

3	Parts: 9/10 - Nice selection, although heavy on the standard yellow and black.

3	Almost zero studded parts.

3	Overall: 9.5/10 - It's a great intro to Technic set - a unique vehicle, good functionality, nice part selection, and decently priced.

3	I like it a lot and plan to keep it around as a finished set.

3	Great review with high quality pictures, well done!!

3	I'm glad you took the time to do it properly.

3	Cool that you have built both models.

3	I agree with the mudguards.

3	They sure look good on this model.

1	I was waiting especially for review of this set.

1	Let me add few things about this... thing.

1	It all will be complainging of person who works with these type of machines, so if you just want a unusual machine in your collection, ignore my complaining :) I see underground loaders almost every day, and believe me, this model would now work in the underground mine.

1	First of all, its cab should stick out more from the frame.

1	Each loader has cab placed out of the chassis, to provide better view for the driver.

1	In this class of machine it would help a bit, but in low loader ones it is extremely important: This is the view from the cab of a low profile loader (looking at front - and yes, front of the machine is where engine is placed, because at least at KGHM all machines drive engine forward): Another thing about that cab is that seat and steering wheel/joysticks are placed perpendicularly to the machine chassis, to provide same view for driving forward and backwards.

1	So another weak spot of the set.

1	The model lacks of trans clear lights on the engine part, because all machines that work underground have same lamps on front and back.

1	Another thing that comes to my mind is that warning light and antena would not live too long in the mine, becuase it could be torn apart by ramming into tunnels roofs.

1	It does resemble shape of underground machine, but not a loader.

1	Only machine that comes to my mind is something that are used for moving/placing hydraulic support jacks in tunnels.

1	Sorry for poor quality, I didn't find better picture of it: It does have claw, four wheels and articulated chassis, but have much greater range of movement of the arm.

1	Anyway, I'd give it at least 3/5 for overall look.

1	Model itself, as a set, looks unfinished (or cut down on pieces after visit of an accountant...) For me it looks like engine part was built differently, with knobs for steering/claw operating sticking out from back.

1	Claw needs almost seven full turns of the worm gear to close from opened position, and is rather annoing to use it in way it is built in this model.

1	Bracket that holds bevel gears responsible for steering is rather loose, being hold in place by single 3/4 pin.

1	On the other hand, the steering works very well.

1	It seems that lack of differential will be more common in LEGO sets, becuase it is another model that have fake engine driven by single wheel (like in old russian RC cars...).

1	I am OK with that, but it is a pitty that this model has only R2 engine.

1	Thing that I do not like the most in this model is how the claw arm works.

1	First of all, it barelly lifts the claw of the ground, the movement could be much better.

1	And it has major design flaw - universal joints are not placed in line with articulation points, and this is main reason of 5L axle not being suported on both sides under the turntable.

1	While rainsing the arm, it bends a little!

1	I really would like to see this model built differently, with normal bucket and better range of movement.

1	Edited by M_longer, 05 December 2015 - 11:08 PM.

2	Thanks for the thorough comments!

2	I agree that the set has some limitations, both in construction and realism, but I think they're acceptable given the pricepoint and size.

2	The antenna is definitely ludicrous - I really do suspect they had a surplus of the swords to use up!

2	And yes, the way the steering knob is mounted is loose.

2	I also noticed that the u-joints to the claw are not in the right spot like you mentioned, but didn't include it since it still works fine.

2	That axle coming forward to the claw has a very long unsupported section that does bend a bit when you raise and lower the claw.

2	It works, but is a bit of a cheat that I'm kinda surprised they let through.

2	I just checked and the bucket from 8043 is a couple studs too wide for this set.

2	I'm betting that was seriously considered, but it'd have meant scaling the whole thing up and that would have put it into a higher price point.

2	Or they could have pulled the mold for the 8x14 bucket back out and remade it for this set...

2	I really like the model you built!

2	And that's interesting about the cabs being basically flush with the top but sticking out the side.

2	In image searching as part of my research, I found both that style and ones like this, with the cab sticking up more (like the photo of the Caterpillar one in my review).

2	I wonder if that's a US/European difference, or different types of mining, or what, because both styles definitely exist in the real world.

3	Excellent review!

3	Worth waiting for.

3	The set itself is very interesting.

3	looks like it may have one interesting build techniques.

3	Thanks for the review, Andy Ad

2	Great review, thank you.

2	The set to me is kinda blah, interested more in the new panels than the rest of it.

3	Think this is the only 1H set I'll be getting.

3	Guess I'm waiting for 2H for the rest of the construction stuff!

3	This set looks okay to me; it includes the instructions for both models, which is cool, and includes some great parts.

3	I like that it's not just another bucket loader and that it actually tries something different, too.

1	Great review and great pictures !

1	Many thanks for talking the time to review this set .

1	I am a fan of LEGO Technic construction stuff, but this set is not so appealing to me.

1	But, then again I am sure some people will love it.

1	Indeed very good review!

1	and also good points pointed out by m_longer ;) this set doesnt appealing to me neither, but before i knew what it was i was thinking it was interesting but now... its so simple, a set close to 500 pieces with only 1 real function, and the entire rear section looks unfinished.

1	Great review!

1	One thing reaaaaaally bothers me about this set, both models have the engine connected to one wheel, the other wheel on the "powered" axle is just left to rotate freely, and that really bothers me, as it did in 42022 (on 42022 even more TBH, since its main feature is being a frigging car).

1	Looking at the pics it isnt even a space issue (as it was in the hot rod, where they "needed" to route the steering through), so they just cheaped out and didnt bother fitting a diff in there (or even a live axle link) Im not very interested in this set (not into construction stuff), but i think this is a worrying trend :(

3	Thanks for review, mostlytechnic.

3	Not a must have for me, but this set have nice assortment of parts... new turntable, new panels (i like yellow).

3	And if i'll buy two of this sets - i'll get enough wheels for proper 18-wheeler.

3	And rubber connectors, that i almost don't using at all, but want to have more and more) Edited by Victor Imaginator, 06 December 2015 - 02:19 PM.

2	Definately a quirky set, I think I'd have prefered a bucket on the front with a complex lift and tip mechanism, but a grab is different.

2	As for the B model, I may prefer it's functions to the A model, certainly something different we have not seen before.

2	Great review indeed!

2	looks like its using the z60 turntable that's on the Mercedes and the crawler crane 42042

2	some mods "all wheel drive" V6 instead straight 2 cylinder Bucket instead Gripper Back lights and oldschool worngear mechanics instead of linear actuators Edited by efferman, 26 December 2015 - 05:52 PM.

3	Nice mod there, Effe, might inspire me when I get one and start modding it

1	Cool mod by effe.

1	But the original model out of the box is one of the poorest models TLG ever released.

1	Looks from front to rear as a cheaped out set with really lazy design effort.

1	A shame for the responsible Lego designer Parts assortment seems to be ok but this should Not be the most important Criteria Sry Jim, i really appreciate your always very well done reviews and offen i agree with the Overall judgements/verdicts and of course tastes are different but especially that review sounds like gushing praise in my ears.... Just my 2 ct Edit: ooops just saw the review isn't done by Jim...<blush>...

1	So sry Jim... Now my final comment belongs to mostlytechnic Edited by Kumbbl, 27 December 2015 - 07:33 AM.

3	I have made a ldd file of a improved version

2	^^efferman : would there be an instruction list for this mod ?

2	a forum member on doktor brick has said he will make an instruction

2	the instruction is done.

2	many thanks to martinsch https://www.dropbox....Loader.pdf?dl=0

3	Lego 42045 Technic Hydroplane Racer Thanks to Lego and EuroBricks for making this review possible!

3	This was supposed to be a preview-review, before the Dec 1 release date for the set, but it got stuck in customs or something and didn't arrive in time.

3	Well, I'd rather do a good, late review than a rushed review, so here it is.

3	Name: Hydroplane Racer Set Number: 42045 Pieces: 180 Price: $19.99 Minifigs: 0 Theme: Technic Year of Release: 2016 Links: Bricklink Brickset The Box Standard Technic box.

3	Action photo, 2-in-1 logo, inset of functions.

3	And the new "try our app" logo in the corner.

3	The Box Back More standard stuff with the B-model and a larger app ad.

3	The Contents 3 bags, two manuals (yes, despite all the ads for their instructions app, they included printed manuals for both the main and B models!

3	), a BIG sticker sheet, and two loose black beams.

3	The Interesting Parts There's a lot of panels in this set.

3	Some are new colors (the blue curved panel) and the L-shaped blue panels are a new mold.

3	I see them being used as mudguards on future sets (or maybe even this year; I haven't looked at the other 2016 Technic sets in detail yet).

3	The hose, soft axle 7 long in black is new as well.

3	The normal 7 axle in yellow is a new color too, and I have no idea why it's in this set.

3	Both models use it in invisible places, so there's no reason other than making it easier to grab the right length axle to have it.

3	I assume other sets this year are using it, but I'm not sure.

3	The Manual And the dumbing-down continues.

3	Now they have to show people to compare axle lengths to the 1:1 prints on the page that have always been there.

3	But how does the 1:1 work on the app?

3	Might have to look into that... (for the record...

3	I pulled out my phone and tried to find the app in the Google store.

3	Couldn't find it.

3	So then I went to the Lego website shown on the page and it had a link to it.

3	Turns out it wasn't showing up because it's tablet only, so Google wasn't showing it to me on my phone.

3	I'll try again later with a tablet...) Starting the Build Two Technic standards.

3	A bunch of pieces linked together to make a specific pattern of holes, and an engine block.

3	Some Weirdness This felt very weird to me - making the crankshaft for the engine, they have you build it right to left.

3	I don't know if it's because I'm a lefty or what, but it felt awkward.

3	I need to look in some old manuals and see if it's always been this way... (nope!

3	I randomly looked at 2013's set 42000 Racer, and it builds it left to right.)

3	Assembling the Core Here's the core of the racer, upside down.

3	The engine block, some gears at each end, and a couple boat studs for smooth gliding.

3	And yes, they cheated and those are only attached on two studs instead of all 4.

3	I'm always amazed at how Lego geometry keeps finding interesting ways that it works.

3	Like here, with those boat studs.

3	They fit perfectly into the bottom of the brick and against the beam.

3	The Front End Up front we get a standard blue seat with a couple "hidden" wheels behind it.

3	A boat doesn't typically have wheels, but these will drive the mechanisms of this model, so we'll let it slide.

3	An odd part choice here though - in the very front there are two tan "axle pin without friction" parts holding that 3 long liftarm on.

3	Why?

3	There's no need in either model for the non-friction pin, and there's lots of the normal blue axle pins in the set.

3	So why include these two different pins?

3	And All Done!

3	It looks like a huge jump here, but it's really not.

3	The front and rear connect to each other, and then a bunch of big panels are added that make the model look WAY bigger.

3	The stickers on this set really make it work.

3	Without them it's pretty bland and boring, so I recommend using them.

3	From the Rear At the back we have a fan to propel the boat.

3	That's not so accurate.

3	All the images I can find of real-life boats use props in the water.

3	But since this is a non-floating model, we have to make some tweaks I guess.

3	There also should be fins going down into the water for stability and hydroplaning, but again, had to drop that.

3	Here's an example of a real boat: You can see they nailed the overall look quite well.

3	The Underside For those that want to see the mechanicals, here's the underside of the model.

3	Minifig Scale Technic?

3	Nope, not quite.

3	A fig will fit the seat, but sticks out of the cockpit and can't fit a helmet at all.

3	So close...

3	Starting the B Model Again with the engine block, but this time an opposing 4 instead of inline.

3	An Odd Part It's rare for Lego to include parts specific to the B-model, so I was curious when I found this 2-axle with pin, a fairly new part.

3	In the main model, it's used in a place that a normal 3 pin would have been fine, and it's the only one of these in the whole set, so it obviously must be needed in the B-model.

3	Sure enough, there's an assembly here that needs it: The Front of the Boat More upside-down building.

3	And that silver piston is basically only there as a spacer.

3	It has no real function.

3	(Yet.... it turns out later an axle goes into it, so it's a support for one end of the axle.)

3	Adding the Wheels We keep building around the engine.

3	This model uses the same wheel setup as the main model.

3	Taking Shape The B-model instructions tell you to put the stickers on in case you haven't - they actually did a good job making the sticker work on either model.

3	But the silver piston used as a cross-brace is a bit weird.

3	It can spin, so that axle hole on the side ends up facing whatever way it wants.

3	The Back End The flex axles are used here under the panels just for appearance and to support the exhausts at the right angle.

3	Same fan propulsion as the main model, and just as wrong here :) Worse, the gearing is switched.

3	In the main model, the pistons and fan spin pretty quickly as you push the boat across the floor.

3	In this one, they turn very slowly.

3	More Instruction Weirdness I'm always curious at how Lego decides to do instructions.

3	Here's how the panels on one side of the boat are assembled.

3	For the mirror image on the other side, they tell you to put all 3 pins into the short panel as step 1 (2 black and a blue), add the white piece as step 2, and then add teh second panel and stickers as step 3.

3	Why two different ways?

3	All Done Here's a similar angle as most of the official images.

3	Looks ok.

3	I noticed though how obvious the wheels are.

3	The back of the box image is a lower angle that hides them more.

3	And I like the mudguard panels as seats.

3	Pretty clever.

3	From the Side I'm not fond of the profile.

3	It doesn't sit level like I think it should.

3	The wheels are a stud too low sticking out of the bottom.

3	The Underside Like most B-models, there are compromises.

3	There's pins and axles sticking out, but that's what you do when faced with a limited piece selection.

3	Minifig Scale Yet?

3	Nope, not quite.

3	A bit too big this time.

3	I think the driver is supposed to sit in the seat with knees over the front of the guard (where the grey pin is).

3	So the minifig is way too small.

3	Spare Pieces Very few leftovers in this B-model.

3	The Conclusion So, what's my conclusion on this model?

3	The B-model is fairly meh, and too similar to the main model.

3	However, I LOVE the hydroplane racer itself.

3	It looks great and is very swooshable.

3	For the price, it's surprisingly large thanks to the big panels on the sides, Yes, this is one set that really needs the stickers to look good, but they look great and are well worth putting on.

3	The Ratings Value: 9/10 - Close to 10 cents a piece, and a fairly large model for the price.

3	Design: 9/10 - Looks great other than the tiny fan on the back.

3	Minifigs: n/a - I was tempted to give a score since a minifig almost fits, but that'd be cheating.

3	Playability: 8/10 - Not much functionality other than the engine and fan spinning, but very swooshable and sturdy enough to be played with.

3	Parts: 9/10 - A bunch of panels (including some new ones), just about every kind of Technic pin, and quite a few thin liftarms .

3	Overall: 9/10 - The set is a solid winner, as long as your satisfied with the main model.

3	Again, great review with superb pictures.

3	The white and blue certainly works very well with your dark backdrop.

3	Thorough review for such a small model.

3	Small in size but great as a set.

3	Tell me, why did I let you review this one?

3	!

2	Quote And the dumbing-down continues.

2	Now they have to show people to compare axle lengths to the 1:1 prints on the page that have always been there.

2	But how does the 1:1 work on the app?

2	Might have to look into that... (for the record...

2	I pulled out my phone and tried to find the app in the Google store.

2	Couldn't find it.

2	So then I went to the Lego website shown on the page and it had a link to it.

2	Turns out it wasn't showing up because it's tablet only, so Google wasn't showing it to me on my phone.

2	I'll try again later with a tablet...) Funny thing is that they changed colour of 7L axle to yellow, and on that picture it still is in LBG.

1	Thanks for a great review!

1	Too bad there is only one blue curved panel in this set.

1	My opinion on the frictionless axlepins is that the flex axle might be easier to stick in them than in regular/blue axlepins...

1	Didn't actually try it though :-) Edited by MajklSpajkl, 05 December 2015 - 11:46 PM.

3	Excellent review!

3	I am glad that you did not rush this or the Mine Loader review.

3	Could it be that the fan in the back is like a turbo prop propulsion.... Just reaching here.

3	Andy D

1	Thank you for the review.

1	I have this one in my pile to build.

1	I wish there was more of the curved blue panels though.

3	here is a video review via JANG to add to the review: i like both A and B so will buy both.

2	MajklSpajkl, on 05 December 2015 - 11:45 PM, said: My opinion on the frictionless axlepins is that the flex axle might be easier to stick in them than in regular/blue axlepins...

2	Didn't actually try it though :-) Frictionless pins have accurate round hole, while blue friction pins have something squarish.

2	Flex axle will fit in both, but using tan pins doesn't require strength.

2	Conncetion with tan pins is weaker too.

2	Great review!

2	Im a bit undecided on the set though, it has some nice parts (4 cil engine in such a small set!)

2	and it looks good, but also a bit small and simple, not sure if it stands up to the standards of the small tracked loader or similar for sets of this size, and as a parts pack (for panels/flaxles) the display team jet is infinitely better.

2	Ill probably pick one up, but right now i really want another tracked loader... (last one was sacrificed to the MOD gods)

3	Nice review, thanks Nice little set, I might buy me one

3	REVIEW - 42038 - ARCTIC TRUCK INTRODUCTION Arctic vehicles aren't new to LEGO.

3	Back in 2000 the Town theme already had several small orange arctic vehicles.

3	In 2014 TLG again released a number of Arctic sets in the City theme (formerly known as Town).

3	Some of these sets are actually pretty big, containing over 700 parts.

3	Looking back in history it seems that Arctic sets may have found their origin in the Technic theme.

3	Although these sets were white instead of orange, they are unmistakenly Arctic.

3	The 1986 Technic Arctic Sets contained the infamous Technic Figures.

3	Unfortunately the 2015 Arctic Truck doesn't contain any Technic Figures, but nonetheless it's great to see a new Arctic vehicle in the Technic line, not counting several snow scooters.

3	Let's see if the new Arctic Truck lives up to the expectations.

3	Note: All images can be clicked for hi-res versions.

3	SET INFORMATION Number: 42038 Title: Arctic Truck Theme: Technic Released: 2015 Part Count: 1219 Box Weight: 2110 gr Box Dimensions: 47,8 cm x 28,0 cm x 7,2 cm Set Price (MSRP): € 79,99 / US$ 84.99 / £ 59.99 Price per Part: € 0,088 / US$ 0.093 / £ 0.066 Links: Brickset, Bricklink THE BOX The box measures 47,8 cm x 28,0 cm x 7,2 cm and weighs around 1385 grams.

3	The box actually feels pretty heavy which means it's filled properly.

3	This seems to be a trend in the Technic theme.

3	Slightly smaller boxes can save shelf space for retailers.

3	THE FRONT The front of the box shows the main model and in the lower right corner there's a image with the dimension of the model.

3	It's 40cm long and 18cm wide.

3	THE BACK The upper part of the back of the box shows the functions of the main model.

3	The lower left section shows the B-model, which looks very promising (more on that later).

3	The lower right section shows the motorization options for the main model.

3	The crane (partially) and the bed can be motorized.

3	Besides motorization some LEDs can be added as headlights.

3	THE SIDE On of the sides shows one of the newer smaller style panels.

3	This is the first time it appears in orange.

3	When you take a look at the sticker you can see that it's not symmetrical.

3	Not sure why TLG "cut of" one of the sides of the stickers, since the position of the panel is very suitable for a continuous sticker.

3	CONTENT OF THE BOX The box is pretty densely packed, which is better than semi-filled boxes.

3	It feels like you actually bought something which matches the box size.

3	The box contains: 2 Booklets 1 Sticker Sheet 8 Bags BOOKLETS & STICKER SHEET Unfortunately the instructions and sticker sheet haven't been packed with cardboard protection, which results in a curved sticker sheet and slightly bent instructions.

3	In my case this wasn't so bad.

3	At least no real damage.

3	HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This set proves to be a great parts pack, especially when you might have missed some of the 2014 sets.

3	BLACK LINK TREADS Usually the Link Treads come in Dark Blue Grey, but this sets includes 96 Black treads, which is great if you'd like to replace the DBG ones in your MOCs, or other official sets.

3	UNDERCARRIAGE AND SUSPENSION Several parts are included to build the undercarriage driving the treads.

3	Four Large Tread Sprockets and eight Small Tread Sprockets, which are used as return sprockets.

3	Also included are four Steering Portal Hubs and four Steering Portal Axles for driving and steering the vehicle.

3	Several frames, including two C-shaped Pivot Frames and two Steering Ball Joints to create an undercarriage much like the 4x4 Crawler.

3	The set even includes two H-shaped Frames (a.k.a.

3	Dog Bone Frames).

3	NEW CHANGEOVER CATCH PARTS This year (2015) three new parts have been introduced to improve the changeover catch.

3	More on these parts later.

3	NEW PIN CONNECTOR Another new part for this year (2015) is the "1L Round Pin Connector", which looks like a pin connector, but acts more like a bush.

3	NEW PINS Furthermore this sets includes quite a large number of three (relatively) new parts.

3	17 x Pin with Pin Hole, 14 x 3L Pin with 1L Axle and 11 x 3L Pin with 2L Axle, which have been introduced this year (2015).

3	When the new 3L Pin with 1L Axle was introduced in 2014 it was only a matter of time before the new 3L Pin with 2L Axle would appear.

3	Both new Pins are a great addition to the parts portfolio.

3	PANELS Last but not least this sets contains a fair number of orange panels, including the 3x11 Panel in Orange, which is the first time we've seen this part.

3	PART LIST Below is the entire part list for the 913 parts.

3	As usual this part list can be found at the end of the second booklet.

3	THE BUILD The build immediately starts with some of the new parts, used to build the compact gearbox in the center of the model.

3	Notice the two 20 Tooth Bevel Gears.

3	One would have been enough to drive the 12 Tooth Bevel Gear, so the second seems to be useless.

3	TLG probably used it in the A-model, because they needed it in the B-model, which you can see later.

3	The front and rear suspension are almost identical.

3	The front side also has the 13L Gear Rack, used for steering.

3	The picture below shows the steering rack on the front suspension in more detail.

3	At this point you have more or less finished the chassis.

3	The gearbox is in place and the majority of the functions has internally been connected to the right gears.

3	The small turntable shows where the crane will be attached later on.

3	At the end of the first booklet, some of the bodywork has been attached to the chassis.

3	The orange-black color scheme never fails to please me.

3	Throw in some cool stickers for the extra effect and we have a winner.

3	If you decide to motorize the model, using PF, the top of the cabin can be lifted to accomodate the battery box.

3	The chassis uses lots of orange (and some black) panels to give the model it's distinctive look.

3	The protective black bumber/railing is a nice addition which adds something to the exterior.

3	The dumping bed at the rear can tilt to empty it's load.

3	It's operated by a Mini LA.

3	The Treads, which look very cool in Black, are driven by a Large Tread Sprocket and returned by two Small Tread Sprockets.

3	The front and rear sections are identical.

3	Building the undercarriages feels a bit repetitive, which is a problem for most tracked vehicles.

3	FINISHED MODEL Adding the crane to the model finishes the build.

3	Your model should look something like this.

3	When you take a close look at the finished model, you realize this is something else.

3	It's trully a unique vehicle.

3	The color scheme is brilliant and the fact that it's an Arctic Truck is really neat.

3	It's a welcome change for the Technic line to see a vehicle like this.

3	This picture emphasizes that's it's a very cool vehicle.

3	Imagine this beast plowing through the snow!

3	As far as I know it's not based on a real life vehicle.

3	If's probably a combination of several vehicles and some imagination.

3	I can be totally wrong though.

3	The rear of the vehicle shows the crane and drum, placed on the tipper bed.

3	From this angle you can see some of the internals of the model, the gearbox behind the cabin for example.

3	The crane can be partially motorized (rotation and base), while the boom is operated manually.

3	What I like a lot is the protective railing around the vehicle.

3	LEFT OVER PARTS Some leftover parts, nothing noteworthy.

3	FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS This set has several functions/features: Steering Driving Suspension Crane Tipping bed STEERING As you can see in the image below the steering mechanism has quite a bit of negative caster (please correct me if I'm wrong), which causes the treads to rotate a bit upward/downward instead of only to the left and right.

3	DRIVING You mention driving as a feature?!

3	Yes I do and let me explain why.

3	Normally I would ommit this as a feature and take driving for granted.

3	However, driving this vehicle (on a flat surface) causes it to simply slide over the surface.

3	For other arctic vehicles this would be a plus, but with a tracked vehicle it limits playability.

3	This is one of the main drawbacks of these tread, they simple don't work properly on smooth surfaces.

3	SUSPENSION The suspension is working properly.

3	You do need to apply some pressure, but all things considered it's not too bad.

3	CRANE The crane has four degrees of freedom: Base rotation Lower boom Upper boom Hook It does what it's supposed to do.

3	Base rotation and lower boom can be motorized and switched using the gearbox, while the upper boom and hook are operated manually.

3	TIPPING BED The tipping is operated via a Mini LA.

3	CONCLUSION While the set does offer various functions and features, driving and steering is a serious issue.

3	Therefor this set is more likely to be showcased than to be played with.

3	B-MODEL Instructions for the B-model are of high quality.

3	Looking at the image below, you will see what I mean.

3	Here's the finished B-model, a tracked Jeep with a communcations device.

3	This alternate model looks so good, it could easily have made it as a main model.

3	One thing that does pop in mind; how would this look with tires?!

3	More on that later.

3	When you are in the artcic region it's imperative to have proper communication channels.

3	Since there's no internet backbone, you will need a big antenna of some sort.

3	This B-model actually features a small trailer wagon with a transmitter/receiver.

3	Here's more detailed image of the B-model, without trailer wagon.

3	I would buy this model in a heartbeat if it were a main model.

3	Simply gorgeous.

3	The side view doesn't give away that this in alternate model.

3	The stickers also work really well in this model.

3	And again, nothing to complain here.

3	The model even has a small crane at the rear, operated by the Mini LA.

3	Here you can see the arctic fleet, comprised of both the A-model and B-model.

3	I bet these two can get some work done!!

3	A bit of a messy picture, but this should give you an impression of the size of both models.

3	LEFTOVER PARTS Not too many parts left, which is obviously a good thing.

3	ALTERNATE MODEL WITH TUMBLER TIRES Just like me, you probably have been wondering how this model would look like with (Tumbler) tires.

3	Well, here it is.

3	As I imagined it does look great.

3	Admittedly, these are not the type of tires we ought to use, but to be honest; I don't really care.

3	Again, the negative caster results in quirky steering.

3	The tires are a bit too big, so they hit the chassis when you compress the suspension.

3	While this has absolutely nothing to do with an arctic vehicle, I really love this picture.

3	SUMMARY We're almost at the end of my review, so what do I think of this set.

3	Let's start with getting the Elephant out of the room; this set lacks proper driving and steering.

3	Does that make it a bad set?!

3	Definitely not!

3	It's a great set, but it lacks some playability when it comes to moving the vehicle.

3	The crane and tipper bed do work properly, so there's still some playability left.

3	Does this set look cool?

3	Definitely!

3	I think it's one of the coolest (no pun intended) and most original models of recent years.

3	The orange and black color scheme works great and the stickers are well designed.

3	The B-model is of very high quality and some might even prefer it over the A-model.

3	And if you are not interested in either of these models, this set provides you with a variety of great parts!

3	All in all I think this is a great set!

3	Maybe not to play with, but it scores high on all other criteria.

3	PROS Original model Great color scheme Lots of interesting parts Great B-model CONS Steering and driving don't work too well Repetitive build of undercarriages (minor con) SCORE Below are my scores based on different categories.

3	8 DESIGN Original and good looking model.

3	7 BUILDING EXPERIENCE Fun to build, albeit a bit repetitive.

3	8 FEATURES Packs quite a few features.

3	7 PLAYABILITY Some features work, some don't.

3	9 PARTS Comes with interesting parts.

3	9 VALUE FOR MONEY Two great model in a single set.

3	8 COOL!

3	As a bonus, here's picture of the main model with Tumbler Tires.

3	Why?

3	Because we can!

3	Very timely review Jim.

3	My wife has just surprised me by giving me this set a few days ago and I have just built the A model two days ago and B model yesterday.

3	I agree with all that you wrote above.

3	I don't have Tumbler tires but I have 9398 tires.

3	Driving is smooth but steering + suspension will be bad as you said due to negative caster and tires hitting the chassis.

3	Anyway, tonight I will destroy the B model and rebuilt this http://www.busterhau...8-c-model.html.

3	I was supposed to publish it together with the 42039 - 24 Hours Racer, but it somehow got backlogged.

3	After completing the reviews for the 2016 sets, I felt I needed to finish it (was already 90% done).

3	That C-model looks cool!

1	The set is a looker, you've got to admit it, but what it gives in looks does not make up for what it lacks in functions.

1	I really wanted this set, badly even, when I restarted my adventure with Technic about a month ago.

1	Than I learned more and more about what a good model can do, mostly thanks to this forum and YT.

1	Right now I'm a bit disappointed with the Arctic Truck - smaller sets offer more functions and teach you much more.

1	Jim it was a great review nevertheless Edited by pgplay, 14 December 2015 - 11:22 AM.

3	Great review.

3	I bought this model several weeks ago and the box has sat on my shelf, so I think after this I will be digging it out for Christmas and I expect my son will have a lot of fun with it when it's built.

3	PS.

3	these Tumbler tyres look amazing on this model, and indeed amazing in their own right!

2	I think this model is more or less supposed to be a version of this thing.

2	A pretty obscure topic, but also very interesting.

2	How about this one: PS I somehow didn't find this picture when I wrote my review.

2	I could be wrong but I am 100% sure that I've seen this review before.

2	You switched the sides for the panel with the unsymmetrical sticker.

2	Otherwise you would see that the cut off part is where there's a beam in front of the panel.

2	That's probably done because the beam could possibly damage the sticker, either while building or while placed against it for a long time.

2	Or it's simply omitted because it wouldn't be (completely) visible

3	Great review and pictures as always.

3	Its an odd combo, but I agree that the B model looks good with tumbler tires THERIZE, on 14 December 2015 - 09:32 PM, said: I could be wrong but I am 100% sure that I've seen this review before.

3	I believe Jim posted the same one in the reviewers academy

3	Another great review I like this set very much, both models look good to me and it's a great part pack for me, the long list in the "high light parts" session tells everything.

3	As for the real world counter part of the A model, how about this: Try googling Sno-Cat and there a lots of such things.

3	Until I saw photos of this set I wasn't convinced I wanted it.

3	Now after seeing all the combinations (A+B and tumbler tires!)

3	I am definitely buying two copies.

3	I need orange parts and black treads anyway.

3	The only problem I have with this is that it's going to encourage me to buy many copies of the drag racer just to get enough wheels to play with.

2	The review was posted there, but only for a week or so.

2	And I have posted links on Facebook, but that was after I posted it here.

3	They prove hard to lose in the snow

2	Richard Dower, on 15 December 2015 - 02:07 PM, said: so....paint them pink..........?

2	Some ski goggles also have yellow/orange-ish glasses, so I reckon orange and white form a contrasting combination.

3	Jim, on 14 December 2015 - 09:15 AM, said: While this has absolutely nothing to do with an arctic vehicle, I really love this picture.

2	Or it's simply omitted because it wouldn't be (completely) visible This is probably the only reason (for TLG choosing to provide an asymmetrical sticker), but looking at the sticker sheet, I also believe they simply didn't have the space on the sheet for a symmetrical solution.

2	A symmetrically stickered panel could have more (re)uses for the MOC'ers.

2	On Lego's own B-model, they handily camouflage it with the exhausts

1	Jim/anyone....i built this set a few days ago, i dont like the way the crane arm section has no knob to turn the mini turntable.

1	you see the 20 tooth gear?....there is a pinhole located next to this....i would like to add something here to make it easier to turn the winch section.

1	I have the 42038, nice set but I found the tipping of the bed clumsy.

1	It was a pleasure to build and I do like the build with the tumble wheels

3	Thank you Jim, nice Review It´s a great set: A lot unique parts and not just pins, axles and beams.

3	I bough it to bring me back to Lego from my DA (10 years)... PS.

3	Soon I will post an alternative model

3	You wrote a very accurate review of this set, Jim.

3	It's a pretty good model (with some obvious problems) but it's an even better parts pack.

3	Your pictures with the Tumbler tires are great.

3	What is the material of the gray background?

3	REVIEW - 42001 - MINI OFF-ROADER INTRODUCTION Technic Mini models are sometimes regarded as models not worth buying.

3	I don't agree with this opinion.

3	Whether it's a special part or innovative building technique, almost every Mini model has something that makes the set worthwhile.

3	This time I will be reviewing the 42001 Mini Off-Roader.

3	This model is not a smaller version of an existing model, so there's no real comparison with a bigger brother, or sister if you will.

3	Nor does the model resemble a real life brand or vehicle, so it is what it is, a Mini Off-Roader.

3	Note: All images can be clicked for hi-res versions.

3	SET INFORMATION Number: 42001 Title: Mini Off-Roader Theme: Technic Released: 2013 Part Count: 100 Box Weight: 165 gr Box Dimensions: 15,5 x 14,0 x 4,2 cm Set Price (MSRP): 9.99 EUR DE / 7.99 GBP / 12.99 USD Price per Part: DE 0.100 EUR / UK 0.080 GBP / USA 0.130 USD Links: Brickset, Bricklink THE BOX The box measures 15,5 x 14,0 x 4,2 cm which is obviously not very big.

3	The weight of the box is approximately 165 grams.

3	FRONTSIDE The front of the box shows a though four wheel drive off-roader challenging a fierce rocky mountain trail...now does it?!

3	What the box actually shows is Mini Off-Roader challenging a small foam rock formation, much like rocks used in Star Trek The Original Series, yet smaller The box also states that this model is for the age of 7 till 14.

3	More importantly, the 2-models in-1 logo is clearly visible, which means this set can be used to build two different models.

3	BACKSIDE The backside shows a picture of the alternate model and a smaller version of the original model.

3	The conversion arrow and the 2-in-1 are printed to clarify that the main model can be converted into a secondary model.

3	SIDES One of the sides shows the 2-in-1 logo and a picture of the main model.

3	Another side shows a picture of one of the wheels in actual size and again, a picture of the main model.

3	CONTENTS OF THE BOX The box contains: 2 Booklets 2 Bags 4 Tires BOOKLETS This set contains two booklets which is not very common for a set this size.

3	Both models share the same chassis, which is why the build has been divided over two booklets, one for the chassis (8 pages with 10 steps) and one for the bodywork (34 pages with 23 steps for the main model and 20 steps for the alternate model).

3	BAGS The box contains only 2 bags which is to be expected from a set consisting of 100 parts.

3	One of the bags is filled with liftarms, panels, rims and two elastic bands.

3	The other bags contains all the other parts, like pins, axles, connectors, etc.

3	Opening the bags results in the following collection of parts, with the exception of the tires.

3	No abundant number parts that will add real value to your collection.

3	Nevertheless, there are some interesting orange parts and elastic bands.

3	TIRES The tires are provided seperately (i.e.

3	not contained in the bags).

3	From the picture you can see that these tires have a front and a back side, so you should pay attention when fitting them to the rims, which have two different sides as well.

3	HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This section describes the unique and/or highlighted parts.

3	VERY SMALL SMOOTH TECHNIC PANEL (#21 AND #22) These two small Technic were new at the time of release and this set was only one of two sets containing them in orange.

3	The other set is the 42007 - Moto Cross Bike.

3	At the moment of writing there's a third set containing these parts, the Black Champion Racer.

3	Side A Side B SMALL RUBBER BAND I was under the impression that these White Rubber Bands weren't that common, but it seems that these bands are as common as dirt.

3	But hey, you can't have enough rubber bands!

3	THIN LIFTARM 1x5 WITH AXLE HOLES Like the panels, these Liftarms were also new at the time of release.

3	Looking at the the frequent usage in other sets, this part has proven to be a most useful mammal.

3	THIN LIFTARM 1x3 Not a very rare piece per se, but if you are not into Bionicle, this liftarm part can be hard to find.

3	Your other option would be to buy the 9390 - Mini Tow Truck, or the 8305 - Dual Bikes from a while ago (2000).

3	LONG PIN WITH CENTER PIN HOLE This relatively new kid on the block is currently used in many Technic and non-Technic sets and has well proven it's worth.

3	AXLE PIN CONNECTOR HUB WITH 2 AXLES Like the previous part this newish part is also quite helpful in certain situations.

3	PART LIST Here's the complete list for all 100 parts.

3	BUILDING EXPERIENCE The build starts with the chassis of the Off-Roader.

3	After connecting some liftarms two elastic bands, one on each side, are attached to the towball pins.

3	This is all there is to the suspension, plain and simple.

3	The two elastic bands contract the L-shaped liftarms, which results in the long ends swiveling downwards.

3	The video below demonstrates the suspension.

3	The simplicity doesn't do it justice, because it works like a charm.

3	The suspension is very smooth with the right amount of stretch and resistance.

3	This great working suspension adds a lot of value to this set.

3	To quote John Hurt in the movie Contact: "Why build one when you can have two at twice the price?".

3	I have purchased two sets so we can simultaneously see both models and make a proper comparison.

3	Below you can see two identical chassis which will be used for both versions of the build.

3	At this stage we have arrived at the end of the first booklet, which only took about ten minutes.

3	Not surprising, since the first booklet only has 10 building steps.

3	Progressing to the second booklet, you need to choose between building the main and alternative model.

3	That's a choice I don't need to make for this review, so let's start with the main model.

3	MAIN MODEL When building the bodywork there's a rather peculiar building technique, which you wouldn't expect in an official LEGO set.

3	The Axle and Pin Connector Hub with 2 Axles only protrudes halfway into the Double Bent Liftarm.

3	The Thin 1x4 Liftarm which is added in one of the following steps makes sure the hubs stay perfectly in place, but I was still surprised to see this technique.

3	The finished bodywork for the main model looks like....uhh...well.....I don't know exactly.

3	It doesn't bear any resemblance to a real life model, which makes it hard to judge.

3	One thing's for sure; it's not the best looking Technic Mini Model.

3	The bodywork can be attached to the chassis by using a 7L axle and two bushes, one on each side of the chassis.

3	ALTERNATE MODEL Unfortunately the alternate model doesn't look much better than the main model.

3	It's even a stud less wide, while you would like to see slightly more body, matching the size of the tires and chassis.

3	Attached to the chassis the body is even more out of proportion.

3	It's not really ugly and the color scheme is great (obviously this goes for the main model as well), but the body simply doesn't match the chassis.

3	I can only imagine that this model is supposed to have a chibi look, much like the Microfighter Star Wars models.

3	COMPARISON The following section shows a selection of images from different angles to compare the main and secondary model.

3	The main model has a bit more volume, while the alternate model has a more sporty look.

3	FRONT VIEW The main model has headlights which are attached at a higher point, while the alternate model has headlights which are placed more closely next to each other.

3	REAR VIEW A slightly different setup in both models, where the main model again has higher placed rear lights.

3	SIDE VIEW The side view shows that the panels are used differently in both models.

3	The main models uses them as doors, while the alternate model uses them as engine cover (bonnet).

3	TOP VIEW The top view reveals that the main model might have room for a minifig PARTS LEFT The left image shows the parts which are left after building the main model, while the second image shows the parts left after building the alternate model.

3	As you can see, the main model uses slightly more parts than the alternate model.

3	FEATURES Besides the awesome suspension, which we already have discussed, there aren't a lot of features in this set.

3	There's actually a single feature, which is only present in the main model....opening doors!

3	Wow, impressive!

3	Well, maybe we can't expect too much functionality in such a small model.

3	SUMMARY The Off-Roader is a fun model which is fairly easy to build.

3	The suspension is simple, yet very effective.

3	The model could do better in the design department, but the suspension offers great playability and that is what this set is all about.

3	The orange parts are not very common so they are an added bonus.

3	All things considered this set is definitely worth the few bucks you need to spend on it.

3	PROS Great suspension Fun to play with Some (semi) rare orange parts Great color scheme CONS No resemblence to an actual off-roader Not the best looking model SCORE Below are my scores based on different categories.

3	6 DESIGN Not the best looking Technic model.

3	7 BUILDING EXPERIENCE The suspension makes it fun to build.

3	7 FEATURES The suspension makes up for the lack of functionality.

3	8 PLAYABILITY The model has Car-Swooshability.

3	7 PARTS Some interesting orange parts.

3	8 VALUE FOR MONEY Great present for the younger builders.

3	7,1 ELASTIC Hope you enjoyed it!

3	Thanks for reading and please rate this set at the top of this topic!

3	Once again, excellent review Jim!

3	Than you for not skipping this small but pretty great set.

3	I also got two of this and I have to say, I really admire the nifty suspension.

3	Building a third bodywork for the same suspension system is still on my backlog.

3	The suspension is indeed awesome.

3	For it's size, this is a great set!

3	Looking at the grades, I seem to have lowballed the score.

2	Sad, i miss this set.

3	Looks like you are late 2 years) Nice set that you can play on your working place while small pauses This set is very cool, especially when you can: 42001 chassis + imagination = http://www.bricksafe...es/rm8/TLC_FJ40 Edited by rm8, 14 December 2015 - 11:17 AM.

1	I don't like appearance of this off-roader at all but I've got it as gift so it's in my Technic collection now.

1	When I built it I was very surprised how cool suspension it has and how much playability it features.

1	I've also tried to build some alternative model out of it but without success.

1	Anyway thank you Jim for great review!

3	Here is the review...for Broadside's Brig 6259!

3	A set from 1991, with a handsome count of 64 pieces, 3 figures, and a sale price of $8.75!

3	The building(and parrot): We'll start off with the front.

3	It looks like a good solid building to hold those scurvy dogs!

3	We yonder over to the left side: And see a nice open back: And yonder to the plain right side: Back to the left, we find the corner, with a nice area to rest your tired soldiers!

3	We see the platform in the corner, a lovely place for soldiers to stand on!

3	It's a bit...skimpy, so watch your step!

3	The middle is blocked by some stones, assuring security!

3	But still open enough to stand in!

3	The jail is cramped, and fits only TWO people, but we only need one prisoner in this set :-) !

3	Moving up is the watch tower, a place for your soldier stand and stand watch or for silly parots to sit on!

3	Here's the front middle part, again those stones blocking the way!

3	Figures and Accesories: We have a delightful number of a soldier, a sailor, and a scurvy pirate!

3	A lovely parot!

3	And a generous assortment of weapons!

3	That concludes our review.

3	Overall: It's a fantastic little set, and great for army and supplies and bricks gathering!

3	I can't find any faults with this set, it's just the neatest little thing you've seen in a port *wub* Highly recomended *y* .

3	And to end our review: A comic!

2	You've done a good job of this review Mr ImperialScouts!

2	But two things.

2	1) Background far too bright and the set is far too dark, easily rectified with Brightness & Contrast adjustment.

2	2) No poll to rate the set out of 5.

2	Nonetheless this should be frontpaged on Classic-Pirates.com!

3	A fine little set with 64 pieces and 3 figures for under $10.

3	May have seemed a bit steep in 1991, but I wouldn't know, I'd passed into my dark ages already, so alas, I haven't a copy of this set.

3	Looking at the parts list, I could build one out of my current inventory though.

3	Issued today for $10, I'd buy no less than 14 of them, even though it does lack the obligatory rowboat for the pirate to make his escape in.

3	Very nice review and comic, thanks for doing them!

2	I'm not generous but I'll do it anyway X-D Now I need to write an artistic statement and then I can write my own review for Broadside's Brig!

2	Huzzah!

2	...and title change as well...the best Conquistador out there!

2	:-$

2	The Poll doesn't allow you to select 2 from 1-5.

2	It instead says 1, 3, 3, 4, 5.

2	But besides that, your review I give it a 5 because 1) shows the set in all angles 2) shows the characters 3) comment on the little creature comforts of the set 4) added a comic (playability) 5) showed true enthusiasm *y* *wub*

2	The poll is for the set, not the review :-D .

2	But thank you anyway!

2	And it appears Mister Phes made the mistake :-P !

1	i'd give a 2, but you put 3 two times.

1	Is a nice set but is not really cool.

1	Is a worse version of Lagoon lock up

3	It's not too expansive and you get some nice pieces like that jail, the damaged yellow corner and a shako of course *wub* For this i''l give it a 4!

3	Very nive review imperial scouts, keep it up!

3	*y* Edited by Captain green hair, 20 October 2007 - 12:39 PM.

3	Great review, cool comic.

3	*wub* I give the set a four, and I will go and buy it now as I am missing many of those parts.... oh it's not for sale?

3	Off to Bricklink then!

3	:-D

3	How much was it again?

3	for the price it looks really solid.

3	if u add the prison to the back it looks REAL good.

3	Hello, Well as this is my first review I hope you like it.

3	The 7744 police station is simply fanstastic.

3	The many minifigs and the vehicles makes it really nice.

3	The great playabillaty and and great space makes it great for children I think.

3	: Well and as last: The interrogation room: Well this was the review.

3	I hope you liked it!

3	Bye

3	Thank you very much for the review, THE-FORCE!

3	The new police station looks great!

3	Hooray assuming from the picture on the box we will also be getting the old police car and bike in blue aswell!

3	Thanks for this great insight the-force!

3	It's mine *wub*!

3	Just got my Luke today from TRU in in Merrilville, IN... ;-)!

3	So here's some pictures and thoughts: Still in the packing with the box Pieces out in the fresh air Put together, ready for some serious Vader vacking >:-)!

3	If you this close you're so dead!!

3	It's yet another lovely maquette *wub*!

3	The only downside is that the LEGO SW sign doesn't even resemble (ok, I've exagurating a bit :'-)) the ones from the other maquettes!

3	Check out this one from the Blackhole Trooper compared with the Luke one: The Luke one is has a massproduced look over it with just a printing |-/ , the other has depth & a painting on it.

3	Now I'm waiting for the long overdue Boba one!

3	Here's the other maquettes reviewed: Darth Vader & Stormie Blackhole Stormie Maquettes On copmike

2	Excellent review copmike!

2	I feel as if I've actually seen the maquette up close in real life.

3	Very nice, thanks for these cool pictures!

1	The luke is 6" high!

1	What is that?!?!

1	Great review!

1	Edited by ~VBBN~, 22 November 2007 - 11:19 PM.

1	Wow i went to my local toysrus and apparently they had some there dont really like them but there neat:)

1	Not my thing, but a very nice review, thanks for sharing it!

1	I was seriously considering this one when it was originally announced as a 6212 copack item at a particularly good price and then everything changed.

1	I do, however, seriously ache to get my hands on one of the more traditionally LEGO looking 2ft+ Vaders they use in the official stores (at least they had one here in Orlando).

1	*wub*

2	Nice review.

2	How's the head made attached to the body?

2	Is there also a boba Fett maquette??

2	If y please a pic??!!?

2	Thanks!

2	While it isn't my style, it looks pretty cool.

2	Thanks for sharing!

2	*sweet*

2	Can you swap head?

2	and coler on the saber?

2	if you have other heads and other lightsaber blades, yes :)

3	During the annual Thanksgiving Road Trip to the relatives, I stopped by the TRU in Portland, OR.

3	Lo and behold, the new Mars Mission sets!

3	Obviously, I bought them.

3	;-) The box: Not much to say.

3	Standard box art for MM sets, nothing new.

3	The parts: Some good parts here.

3	Even if you don't like the set (Which I highly doubt after I've had my say :-P ), it's a decent parts pack.

3	I noticed that some old parts have been renewed.

3	I know the wheel has been used in the '07 sets, but the cockpit and hitch I haven't seen in a while.

3	The VLDSS (Very large DSS).

3	Grr.

3	New part.

3	At least, I think it is.

3	Someone slap me if it isn't.

3	*wacko* The figs.

3	I know I've seen that head before, but I have no idea where.

3	Does anyone know?

3	I was hoping that the aliens would have new arms, at least.

3	I was sadly mistaken... On the upside, I finally discovered that they glow in the dark.

3	:-$ The alien has a jetpack.

3	If that's not the silliest thing I've ever seen, I don't know what is.

3	The build.

3	Simple build.

3	A block.

3	So easy a caveman cou- oh, never mind.

3	Geico's used that one enough.

3	Then, we have this jobber right here.

3	Not sure what it is, but it looks like some crystal scanning device.

3	It's starting to look pretty nice.

3	It almost looks practical.

3	The cockpit is suffering from a bad dose of over-stickering.

3	On the upside, we have a new piece there to hold the cockpit on.

3	Part 1 complete.

3	It has a nice little radio antenna, which is ruined by the use of a random missile that looks like it's going to shoot the antenna before it shoots the alien.

3	Still, I never say no to a good missile I can use for something else.

3	The trailer: Fairly simple, but it works.

3	It features stabilizing arms, a handheld saw, and an extremely random mini-bot who's purpose escapes me.

3	The Whole Meal Deal- Erm, general pics.

3	Overall, I thought this was a good set.

3	In fact, it reminds me of this:

3	Finally we have seen the light!!!

3	I've been waiting for a while deciding if I was gonna get this....well I've decided after that wonderful review I am!

3	Good job reviewin!!

3	*wub*

3	Cool review, thanks!!

3	:-D I personally think the minirobot is awesome, and (dare I say) cute!

3	This was described on Amazon to be a mobile lab, I'm not seeing that.

3	I do however see a crystal hauling vehicle.

3	*sweet* Pretty cool, not as bad as previous sets.

3	~Peace

3	very cool.

3	i'm getting this one as soon as its in america!

3	well maybe.

3	depends on how much money I have.

3	i got most of the sets from '07, they're pretty cool.

3	Thanks for the review, it's a neat little set.

3	I hope it comes to Australia sooner rather than later.

3	That minifig head was also used in 7699 MT-101 so that may be why it seems familiar.

2	bjboyle, on Nov 25 2007, 09:29 PM, said: =That minifig head was also used in 7699 MT-101 so that may be why it seems familiar.

2	Ah.

2	But I think where I did see it is the lego Magazine, in the article on Biff Barker.

3	Thanks for the review!

3	*sweet* Aside from the fact that I like the model, this set has a few new and useful pieces so I will have to get it!

3	*wub*

2	thanks for the review.

2	I still will not get this set.

2	Speechless about it

3	A wonderful set and, perhaps, as close to Classic Space as possible.

3	*y* Also there?s a great amount of very useful and interesting parts too like these round 'stabilizer' parts with clip.... :'-) There?s a complete different feeling with this new sets compared to the first MM ones.... 8-| Beside the a little more realistic aspects of it with the more enclosed cockpit (nearly with some controls.... ;-) ) it?s the overall more solid feeling I guess....

3	The other sets look pretty neat and fashionable at the surface, but their internal structure is much more hollow and useless with some studless technic beams and such stuff.... very shining, but hard and boring to MOD, just aimed for maximal cool looking box art and the rest went down for saving costs.... (beside that already pretty good 7692 Dropship that is).

3	The only thing I don?t get with that is why the minirobot?s a one-armed one.... ach, Pirates on Mars I suppose.... X-D

3	that head might have been from rock raiders.

3	lovely set, and a good review.

3	jifel

2	Hmm, not actually a bad set.

2	Not high on my 'to buy' list, there're other things up there first, but definitely a possibility somewhere down the line.

2	Thanks for the review.

1	Great review, but am I the only one who thinks this is a pretty homely looking vehicle?

1	The small exploration robot is cool, but the large windscreen on the main vehicle reminds me about Jack Stone!

1	I also think the bases of the vehicle parts are very basic and look almost unfinished with the holes and such.

1	I think I will pass this one, even though the alien has a jet pack and there is the nice mini vehicle.

1	Tks for the great review MM ;-) Its always appreciated to have reviews of new set.

1	Having said that I really don't see the point of that set and its such money and time wasted IMO.

1	I don't like that theme apart the dropship and 6wheeler and that tiny vehicle doesn't do the trick for me.

1	I see it as a really cheap excuse to try and please Classic Space fan with that horrendous MM graphics and what amazes me is that you guys loke that :-D Money saved On !!

1	*yoda*

1	Ah, thanks so much again, Mr. M!

1	This set looks great!

1	I probably won't get this though.

1	I hat MM as far as it goes.

1	I agree with xwingyoda on this one.

1	Does the minibots wheels move?

3	X-D :-D Hilarious Actually.......However its imapled to it, so I guess its a suicide mission :-D Piranha

3	Thanks for posting the picture of this new MM set.

3	When I first saw the Mars Mission sets I was a little apprehensive about the design and the aliens (They could have at least make movable arms :(), but anyways when I bought the small fighter I was totally hook.

3	My fave set from the line is the mech.

3	During the annual Thanksgiving Road Trip to the relatives, I stopped by the TRU in Portland, OR.

3	Lo and behold, the new Mars Mission sets!

3	Predictably, I bought them.

3	I present to you: the MX-41 Switch Fighter!

3	Man, what a long name.

3	The box: Standard MM.

3	On the front, it shows the Fighter in flight mode, and a yellow note telling you that it transforms.

3	The back shows three pictures showing it happen.

3	The parts: Once I open the box, the first thing that comes out is a bent and rolled up instruction booklet, and I was forced to put it under a stack of beer books for an hour.

3	Then, there's the DSS.

3	Yes, two of the stickers do feature a cobra.

3	I wonder why, because this set's decal should be a beatle.

3	X-D Decent parts, nothing too special.

3	Then, I noticed this little part.

3	It's used for the flick-missiles, but I have no idea what else it would be used for.

3	:-/ The Build: The alien ship: When I looked at the box art for this set, I was releived to see that the aliens don't have another curved-forward wing ship.

3	Instead, they have this little beauty, which appears to be the Alien Mini Cooper- small and hot.

3	*wub* Anyway, partially completed.

3	Even if you don't like the set, it has some nice green flame peices, which work nicely for space laser swords.

3	Fully completed.

3	The only annoying bit about it is that the crystal-holding thing in front wobbles all over the place.

3	The alien fits into it by way of impalement.

3	It must hurt getting in and out.

3	Switch fighter (cockpit): The set makes good use of the Alpha Team cockpit.

3	For controls, it has a meagre handlebar that the astronaught can't even reach.

3	The rear "shell" of the fighter starts out around the alien containment chamber.

3	It's a bit odd that the containment chamber has an alien sticker, because the instruction booklet lists it as holding crystals.

3	The crystal canister is held back by a technic pin.

3	This is, without a doubt, the ugliest color arrangment EVER.

3	Warning: Mass stickers.

3	:-X The cockpit fits into grooves in the "shell".

3	Then it clicks into place in a 1x1 brick with a horizontal clip.

3	The wing "mechanism": The wing.

3	For some reason, the body of the "mechanism" has a blue brick.

3	*wacko* The wing and "mechanism" connect to prevent the fighter doing a nosedive while in tank mode.

3	The wing "mechanism" completed: The underside: The body and wing connect by way of a miscolored red brick.

3	I have no idea why it's red- black would bave been much, much better.

3	Completed.

3	Tank mode: All in all, this looks pretty neat.

3	The wheel base is pretty short, but it's not bad.

3	Transform!

3	The set transforms neatly, if ungainly.

3	Without "Anti-grav" support, it would fall forward on it's nose each time it transformed.

3	Jet mode.

3	It's all right, but it could be a bit better.

3	The "shell" keeps slipping back forward to the "tank mode" because there's nothing to stop it sliding.

3	Spare parts: Overall: I thought this set was great.

3	It could do with some fixing, such as the mismatched colors, but it should be a definate buy for MM fans.

3	Brickshelf Gallery (When available)

3	cool review.

3	I'm actually liking that new missile part as it seems to combine a bar with a pin.

3	But it's a real eyesore if you ask me.

2	*wub* Thanks for another great review.

2	*sweet* I am also glad that it is a very different alien fighter design as I already have three varients of the old type!

2	The fighter transforms better than I thought it would; I was expecting just the wings.

2	I should be buying this set as well... Mr. Mandalorian, on Nov 26 2007, 03:45 PM, said: Without "Anti-grav" support, it would fall forward on it's nose each time it transformed.

2	Well, since anti-grav doesn't exist, and will never exist, there has to be another option!

2	Looking at it in tank mode it does have a vague aerofoil shape so I think it should be able to work as a lifting body.

2	All it needs to do then is move fast enough to start taking off and then it can extend the wings... 8-|

2	Great review!

2	"How can it support itself without anti-grav while transforming?"

2	The answer?

2	It can't *sweet* :-P

1	Hmm, Its actually a nice bit better than I expected, and great review, thanks!

1	But think ill pass on this one.

1	I quite like the alien fighter though, heh.

1	And loved the way you described how he sat in the cockpit.

3	Very cool review, Mr. Mandalorian!

3	This isn't a bad set, the alien craft is very sleek (if only they'd gone with the old alien body in trans-green...) and the transforming is alright.

3	The tank mode looks sweet.

3	*sweet* ~Peace

2	after seeing this set review it change my mind about this set.

2	By the way thanks for the great review.

3	Thanks for that very good review, Mr. Mandalorian!

3	*y* I think that this is a plain beautiful set, oh how I wish that TLC would?ve taken that direction from the beginning.... :'-) The design is much more practicable, with fewer non-system parts and technic beams with(!)

3	studs.... this makes everything much more easier to MOD and a lot more useful, at least IMO.

3	*y* So it?s for sure not very hard to make the (wonderful enclosed) cockpit one brick higher, and even that little Alien Ship looks decent and nice.... X-O And the fighter looks sleek and elegant too, in both modes!

3	That?s just very cool, compliments, TLC.

3	Now all we need?re aliens with moving arms and here we go, Classic Space on forever!

3	X-D

3	Thanks for a very thorough review.

3	I might think about getting this.

3	I really like the mini alien fighter, and the transformation idea is always a welcome one.

3	Both modes look pretty good, despite the some of the odd coloured bricks (which I'd MOD out).

3	You know what it reminds me of?

3	Some of the futuristic designs in the Gerry Anderson series.

3	Wow.

3	This is actually quite a neat set!

3	It is definitively my favorite in the line after the big drilling unit!

3	\begin{geek} I'm not sure it would nose dive when transforming from tank mode.

3	I guess it would pick up speed and transform quickly since it doesn't seem to have any downwards pointing thrusters.

3	\end{geek}

3	friggin sweet, Thank you mr mandy for the reveiw of this sweet ship!

3	*y* *wub*

1	hmmm, I doubt I'll be getting this set.

1	Good review though.

3	I really like the transforming aspect of this!

3	The one thing I wish MM sets would include would be baseplates.

3	I liked that about the classic space stuff because it really helped create the environment.

3	Some "Red Rock Orange" Mars Baseplates would be great!

3	Hmmm, great review for a great set.

3	*y*

3	Thanks, guys!

2	I guess it would pick up speed and transform quickly since it doesn't seem to have any downwards pointing thrusters.

2	The one thing you'd have to make sure of, though, is that it was fairly light and the wheel base had a fairly large surface area (actually, that's two things), so as to make sure it didn't dig into the soil.

2	If that happened, transformation would be harder as the wheels would dig into the ground and drag through the soil.

2	Then it'd nose dive.

1	Great review Mr Mandalorian!

1	*y* I'm not a fan of MM and don't like this set much, but it has some neat features.

1	But the only way I can see it transforming is by racing off a cliff and swinging its wings out *wacko* To the Brickmobile!

1	>:-)

1	and another tks and congrats MM on that review !!

1	Like the o?her post I think that this set is a wastre of time and money and shelfspace.

1	Its such a ripp off from that ugly Alfa Team crapjet.

1	I do not like the design of the jet itself: the small flags as front is so lame !!

1	And I don't like those orange wheels as engines !!

1	Furthermore I don't like the "rover" mode either !!

1	The only cool thing about it is the special martian jet which they should ahve sold separatly :-P At least some interesting parts but that far from saving that set IMO |-/ Money Saved On once again :-P *yoda*

3	A needed solution to those blasted flick missles from falling out while swooshing.

3	*sweet* Wonder if the range might have an issue seeing it's held in there but who knows, maybe they now "pop" out with a greater velocity than a mere finger flick?

3	I had resorted to technic 1/2 bushings (smooth) to lock in the missile's technic axle (with stud).

3	Great review, Mr. M!

3	*y* I *wub* those green flames, and the design of the ship is pretty good.

3	8115 Dark Panther review Check out my review of this great new Exo-Force set.

3	Comic and rating will be up shortly!

3	And hopefully more reviews too... :-)

3	Yes, finally!!!!

3	Hinckley youre the best!!

3	Is there a chance I can ever be in one of your ever so loved comics?

3	I just read it and so far so good in the 08 EF line.

3	Looking forward to the rest of the review!

3	Edited by Exo-builder59, 27 November 2007 - 04:04 AM.

2	So Hinckley, can you give us a hint on what our walrus friend will do with the Dark Panther?

2	I can't wait to see.

2	8-|

3	awesome.

3	i can't wait to get my hands on this one.

3	Great review Hinckley!

3	I know you've been busy, so thank you so much for getting this up!

3	:-D The spine construction is clever, the minirobot's cool, this is a fantastic set!

3	~Peace

3	Sweeeet.

3	*wub* It's nice to finally see a set that's not bipedal or (?)

3	Tripedal.

3	Quote Exo-Force is an anomaly in my LEGO interests.

3	I don't know why I like it so much or why I keep buying it but I do.

3	That would be a problem, wouldn't it?

3	:-P Quote The cockpit itself is constructed very well but the canopy seems like an afterthought, closing on to the robot's head and leaving his back and sides completely exposed.

3	I dunno.

3	At least it has a canopy, unlike past sets..

3	Thanks Hinckley!

3	It's always nice to see your reviews, and I can't wait to see the story mode (from the pic, I guess it will include Sinner and Hinckley, instead of Bianca and Gavin, right?

3	8-| ) LuxorV

3	Thanks for this fantastic review Hinckley, I can't wait to see the comic!

3	:'-) I REALLY love this mech as I am a fan of non-bipedal mechs (though I am terrible at making them), the purple is great and I can't wait to see what MOCers will use those awesome new spike peices for!

3	3 robots in one mech is a really good deal too, and that spider droid just adds so much more to the set.

3	And thanks for taking the time to do this!

3	*sweet* Not to sound like a smartypants though, but the grill peice in purple is not the first time this has happened, two were included in the 06 Joker Helicopter ;-) Thanks again!

3	To the Brickmobile!

3	>:-)

3	Awesome Reveiw thanks for the pics!!

3	Did the instructions come with a comic?

3	Thanks for that very neat review, Hinckley!

3	*y* This set looks indeed very interesting, with a very cool antlike look and a simple but essential overall design.

3	The cockpit seems better protected than many other EF ones, that spine?s lovely and the way these Iron Drones?re attached is simple but effective.

3	:-) And hey, did I miss something or?re there really no crappy shooting devices...?

3	:-P Thanks to the minirobots and their inventor I guess.... :'-)

2	Great Review!

2	*y* I am sure to get this set for parts now.

2	His legs dont look very poseable... :-/ Thanks Hinck!

2	~VBBN~

3	Great review as always, Hinckley.

3	Frankly I'm in love with this thing.

3	So much so, in fact, that I've been calling it 'Shadow Panther' for weeks, but never mind...

3	Anyway, why do I like it?

3	Well, purple is such a fantastic Lego colour- it's sparingly used, which makes it interesting, and it simply looks great.

3	Those jetpack/backpack things the robots are wearing, and if they are jetpacks, as the back of the box suggests, then the use of chaisaws is quite nifty and innovative.

3	The minibot is cool, and certainly an interesting gimmick.

3	Sure, they don't look quite as good in some of the other sets, but here it looks great.

3	The overall structure and design are cool too.

3	It's always nice to see an 'irregular' mech, and this is no exception.

3	It's especially cool whee the spines are concerned.

3	Plus, on top of all that, it's got a nice selection of parts, including some lovely new ones, and the inlaid box is interesting.

3	Well worth getting, I think.

3	Another fantastic review, Hinckley.

3	I really like this set, I wasn't to keen on it when I first saw the pictures bit having seen the review, I am starting to like it.

3	It seems quite sturdy, and it makes a change from the usual 2 legged mechs.

3	As well as that purple is welcome anywhere, I have such a shortage of that colour!

3	I like the rusty orange colour of the robots, and their back/jet packs are quite cool, and the mini robot looks sweet.

2	Thanks everyone!

2	I'm glad you are enjoying the review.

2	I'm working on the 8118 right now and will have comics up for both starting tonight.

2	X-D ;-)

2	Don't forget Bianca and Gavin, o' Lordship of Pies!

2	:-D Truly another excellent review!

2	The pictures are absolutely splendid, as usual!

2	I'm really glad those air-vent pieces were done so well.

2	While I remain skeptical about the new giant spikes, you've sold me on this set!

2	I can't wait to see the Fabuland comic and your final verdict, Hink!

2	Whenever I click on any of the thumbnails, I get an error.

3	That's a very interesting set... and with all that purple a must buy.

3	I decided recently that I am going to resist buying Lego unless it's on sale next year, but I have so little purple.... 8-| I love the little robot!

3	:-P Thanks for the photos Hinckley and I look forward to the comic!

3	*sweet* (As Sir Dillon said, some of the links appear dead but I suspect it is a server error... :-/ )

2	I too got an error message when clicking on the images, but the text links work correctly 8-| I wonder which way Gavin will meet his death this time :-D LuxorV

2	Thanks for pointing that out guys.

2	It should work now... :-$

2	8118 Hybrid Rescue Tank Review Enjoy guys!

2	I am working on more.

2	Maybe we'll have the 8112 Battle Arachnoid next.

2	The comics will be around eventually.

2	Sorry for all the delays and the teasing.

2	I appreciate your patience!

2	!

2	Hah screw patience!

2	You're the best Hink!

2	I can't wait for the comics.

2	Great Almost finished review *y* Thanks for doing these, since you are probably busy However my favorite part is missing, The comic!!

2	:-D Interesting set, however I never liked exoforce but I like the parts Wait On!

2	From the LEGO Store in Chicago, if I recall his post properly!

2	My goodness Hink, you're going to pull an all-nighter for reviews at this rate!

2	Oh well, it's kinda worth it, right?

2	:-P

3	Another great review, Hink!

3	Looks like a great set.

3	Quote The cockpit isn't sealed and is actually aggravatingly unrealistic as it leaves the drivers chest vulnerable to enemy fire.

3	Actually the cockpit lacks any controls as seen here where it looks like Keiken is simply pounding a counter demanding food.

3	:-D "Gimme food!

3	Or else my friend up there willl shoot your punk- @$$ into mars!"

3	Well, I guess that explains why there are no robot snipers in EF.

3	If there were, well.... Wouldn't be much of a story, would there?

3	X-D

2	Darnit, Hinckley!

2	>:-( You always make us wait for the comic, which is almost everyones favorite part!

2	>:-( |-/ X-D I just noticed Ryos uniform had a camo pattern.

2	With all the orange he has, it's kinda pointless.

2	Edited by Lt. Veers, 28 November 2007 - 04:48 AM.

2	this designers were on a roll with this one until it came to the flying unit.

2	It looks like a shambles, epecially the guns looking rather simplistic.

2	Although they used something similar to the light and sound globe peice, which is kind of neat.

2	I dont think I'll be buying this but your review almost talked me into it.

2	Cool!

2	But my reviews are not meant to sway anyone.

2	They should just inform people further as if they want to buy it or not.

2	I am not necessarily for encouraging anyone to buy every set I review.

2	:-D But I'm glad you liked it.

2	Thank you.

2	And actually I did feel the same way you did about the flying module, until I put Sinner in it and started to play.

2	Here's a sneak peek of the comic and a cool feature of Ryo's ship-it can be configured in a lot of different ways:

3	This one is much better than I thought; I didn't expect the gun and the "turret" to be geared!

3	I agree that a lot of the details sux (hollow inside, lame cockpits...) but as an overall package it looks quite good.

3	The best part is.... no shooter!

3	Is the nightmare finally over?

3	:'-) The bonus robot is a much better idea.

3	The large amount of blue pieces make this a must buy for me as Impartial needs more raw materials!

3	:-P How well do the tracks work?

3	The last tank was too light and it didn't roll well at all.

3	:-/ Thanks for these photos as well Hinckley.

3	*wub* So far the 08 Exo-Force sets are looking good!

3	*sweet* Hinckley, on Nov 28 2007, 04:48 PM, said: And actually I did feel the same way you did about the flying module, until I put Sinner in it and started to play.

3	It's big enough for my big walrus head!

2	Sinner, on Nov 28 2007, 12:53 AM, said: How well do the tracks work?

2	The last tank was too light and it didn't roll well at all.

2	:-/ It's similar in weight but I didn't have to press down so hard to get the treads to move, barely at all, really.

2	I think the Mobile Defense Tank, although a better overall design, suffered from the odd angle of the treads and that was mostly why the treads didn't turn well.

2	Plus, what was with those weird exhaust pipes??

2	Anyway, they are both cool tanks although I like the Mobile Defense Tank better... :-)

3	Thank you for the glimps at the new set Hinckley *y* .

3	I saw this set today at my local TRU store.

3	The new slope 1x2 pieces look very *sweet* .

3	I definitly see great potential for these pieces on locomotives.

3	I hope these are going to be bountiful in the 2008 lines.

3	Model On!

3	!

1	Fantastic!

1	Great review, thanks a bunch for all the pics, they've shown me how (in my opinion) bad this set is.

1	:-P I just expected it to be more bricky rather than technicy.

1	Oh well, I wasn't planning on buying it anyway.

1	X-D I noticed you spelt mini-figs mini-fgis in the first paragraph, in case you wanted to know.

1	X-D So again, thanks, and I'm looking forward to seeing the rest of them, and the comics!

3	Thanks for this great review Hinckley!

3	:'-) I know you're loving this attention!

3	X-D :-P I actually like this set, and like it a lot more now that I've seen this review.

3	I'll most likely get, mostly for the figs and parts.

3	I reckon it would look a lot better alongside the rest of the 2008 EF mechs.

3	Anyway, thanks for the review!

3	To the Brickmobile!

3	>:-)

2	Thanks for this other great review, Hinckley *y* !

2	You sure you don't work as one of TLC's PRs?

2	X-D ;-) Everytime I see one of your reviews I want to buy the set, and that is sweet to me, but bad for my money 8-| LuxorV

3	Thanks for that good review, Hinckley.

3	*y* A really interesting set and a turning point for LEGO.

3	Minirobots instead of shooting crap, pretty cool.

3	I hope the kids?ll like it too.

3	For the design, I love that asymmetrical look of the front part and the sleek guns of the flyer.

3	It?s smart that the gatling gun moves along with the tank, too.

3	The set idea with two vehicles in one?s not new, but very play- able and the treads/big wheel design?s cool.

3	I don?t like the use of studless technic beams, but well, they do their job I guess.

3	And Keiken?s cockpit should be easy to improve....

2	Asuka, on Nov 28 2007, 02:41 PM, said: For the design, I love that asymmetrical look of the front part and the sleek guns of the flyer.

2	The asymmetry reminds me of the Wookie vehicles in StarWars Battlegrounds... *y* And I see they changed back to the first color schemes for minifig suits, which I think where better than the dark suits of 2007 (except for Hikaru's *wub* ) LuxorV

2	Can't wait for the extended review!!

2	;-)

2	Thank you for the review Hinckley :-) Already waiting for the comic X-D

3	Some of you might know that I'm not a big fan of exo-force, but this set is an exception.

3	This looks like a futurist tank.

3	My kids would love this.... if I should have any :-D As always, very professional review Hinckley!

2	I think this is probably my least favourite set of next years selection, but I still might get it, partly because of this review (thanks, btw).

2	I quite like the mini-robot, and while there are a few problems (the front cockpit, the exposed axles) I relish the idea of MODing them out, and correcting them.

2	And the change back to the original figs is welcome.

2	I didn't really get any of this years sets, only last years.

2	Makes it easier from a MOCing potential, anyway.

3	crap!

3	>:-( now i have to spend all my money on this!

3	*wub* *wub* and whats the code?

3	oh well, awesome set, and judt curios, didnt the reviewers used to be bianca and gavin?

2	*sweet* I like using me and Sinner better, though.

2	I have put Fabuland Housewives on the back burner for a while, but plan to revive it for the first season conclusion in January.

2	It's nice to see that there are people who really follow it out there.

2	Thanks!

2	:-$

2	8112 Battle Arachnoid Review I've opted to do another set review instead of getting the comics up.

2	I don't want anyone to beat me to the reviews.

2	So, thanks for your patience and enjoy the review.

2	The comics will be up in due time.

2	Thanks!

2	:-$

3	Thanks for this new review, Hinckley *wub* For me, it was love at fistr sight with this little set :-P It's simple but nice, and way better than Shadow Crawler for a spider-like mech *y* You sure will be very busy these days, and your characters will get breakdown before they finish filming all the comics X-D LuxorV

3	Thanks for that neat review of a very nice set.

3	The color scheme?s great and that minirobot looks very comical and funny indeed, sweet!

3	*sweet*

3	Awesome!

3	Thanks Hinckley!

3	I was not planning to get this set but now it look as if I will have too.

3	(I still cannot afford it anyway) :'-(

3	i would agree.

3	the spider looks really cool.

3	too bad we can't see how the combo mech looks like.

3	instructions are not online yet.

3	:-/ there should be another combo mech but you'll need the storm lasher set.

3	:-P

3	Hinkley, you are the MAN!

3	Your reviews just keep on getting better and better!

3	Although all of the sets this year are great and I love them all to bits, I can't say there was one that I absolutely felt like something I'd buy except for the Storm Lasher.

3	But with this review, I think this will be the first purchase of 2008 for me!

3	I totally agree with you on how the Spider looks better without Mini-robot.

3	But from looking at where the cockpit is placed and how the skull on the cockpit is lodged underneath the walker, maybe the mini-robot would look better mounted underneath the head?

3	That way it looks more even and even gives the thing a nasty set of teeth!

3	I gotta try it out once I get it.

3	Can't wait for the Fabuland comics!

3	Keep it up, Hink!

2	Hinckley, on Dec 6 2007, 04:56 AM, said: honckly?

2	wow, dude.

2	:-/ Well, at least you got the c and the k. Of course, the e is missing.

2	It's all right though.

2	Eight letter words can be challenging :-P That's always the case for me.

2	Although, I have the Assault Tiger and will start on it next.

2	On the box it looks like it is wearing huge bell bottoms.

2	:-D I want to get the Chameleon Hunter, I really like the look of it and forgot to pick it up.

2	Guess I'll have to go back to TRU!

2	:-$ Cross your fingers that I find more Indy sets!

2	X-D i'll just stick to calling you hink *y* (less letters :-D )

2	zero1312, on Dec 5 2007, 05:27 PM, said: Wow, nice review.

2	*y* But I have a question: Where can I find these "ork sets" everyone is refering to because of these swords in the rotors.

2	:-/ Are you talking about the Dwarves Mine?

2	*sweet*

3	cool!

3	another *y* *y* *y* *y* *y* *y* out of *y* *y* *y* *y* *y* and could you post a pic of all the minirobots and planes

1	thanks for the review, although I still have no intentions of buying this, it's neat to know what's inside, the build etc... (the etc being the comic ;-) X-D ) It's wierd because I dont know what it is I dont like about this set.

1	Exo-builder59, on Dec 6 2007, 01:30 AM, said: Are you talking about the Dwarves Mine?

1	*sweet* Yes, when in 2008 do these sets come to Germany?

1	:-/

3	Oh, I just *wub* theat mini-bot.

3	Creepy, but strangely cute... Nice piece selection, and the idea of something with rotors that double up as cutters storming (no pun intended) through the jungle ripping it apart is just fantastic (to me, anyway).

3	I'm liking the new swords as rotors blades, that's pretty innovative, and the exhaust pipe pieces are intriguing.

3	Thanks for the review, Hinckley!

3	I like the set it looks good, and all those ork swords..... *wub*

2	zero1312, on Dec 6 2007, 09:48 AM, said: Yes, when in 2008 do these sets come to Germany?

3	Here is my review of the set 6265 Sabre Island!

3	Overview: Sabre Island was release in 1990 an it contained 92 pieces and its retail price was $15.50.

3	It comes with 3 Imperial Blue coats, and a nice outpost for them.

3	The pictures + full review: Anyway, you can see here a picture of the box, the model shown on the box differs from the actual model slightly.

3	...And the back of the box, which shows some nice alternative models from the pieces provided.

3	A close up of two or three of the alternative models.

3	And now for the minifigs.

3	I prefer the Red coats over the Blue coats but these minifigs are nice, and for the number of pieces one gets a fair amount of them.

3	The set itself makes a nice small outpost, it comes complete with a palm tree, a cannon (with ammo) on a turntable, a small tower a nice large Imperial flag and a little red row boat!

3	Here is a shot from ground level showing the cannon and Blue coat (patrolling the out post!)

3	The rowing boat was a nice touch, and it comes with a small flag too.

3	"No Pirates will avoid the wrath of myself and my mighty Island!"

3	The top of the tower is rather plain and simple which in some ways is good, as it keeps the whole set detailed yet not crowded, but I feel a little something should of been added to the top though.

3	The back is lacking any type of walls, so one can play with the minifigs inside, yet their are also no stairs or any other ways for the Blue Coats to climb up their tower either!

3	The rag tag pirates attack Sabre Island!

3	But never fear, The Lord Of Pies is here!

3	Me throwing a pie at Captain Ironhook from another angle.

3	Overall I think this is a very good, if somewhat simple set, and makes a great cheap Imperial set!

3	Comments, thoughts and Opinions are welcome!

3	(And sorry about the darkness in some photos, I have not had time to take photographs when it is till light recently, for when I return home it is dark |-/ ) Edit: Fixed, Thank you!

3	Edited by Phred, 12 April 2015 - 05:14 AM.

3	Fantastic review!

3	I'll post my views on the set later when I have more time.

3	But I've already fixed the poll.

3	Nice review!

3	Hmm...I gave it a 4...Why?

3	Very good bits: -3 epaulettes for 3 gurads!

3	-Patterned wall parts -Cannon Bad bits: -No pirates to fight -Title is rather grand for an outpost -Top needs battlements, not very low lattices -Needs a more substantial base - the wall goes right into the sea!

3	- Surely the whole thing would sink... -Palm tree is too short ...and the rest is good!

3	:-P You might want to fix the vote option for 5 - it appears to be the title; you can't vote for it... Pirate King Skelly Killer Edit: OK, Boney, but I gave it a 4!

3	(more figs would be appreciated though, a sneaky pirate perhaps) 4 out of 5!

3	Thanks for that nice review, it?s a 5 for me.... just a great little Blue coats set, perfect for army and fortress building.

3	*sweet*

3	I remember buying this set and thinking what an amazing job LEGO had done.

3	It was my first Pirate set and I still have it built.

3	Thanks for this review, and the pictures are great!

3	*sweet*

3	Thank you for the comments!

3	*sweet* I wonder who voted "1", surely such a nice set doesn't deserve such a low score!?

3	*wacko*

3	It's not a bad thing to vote Sabre Island 1 if someone feels that it's genuinely worth 1 but t'would be interesting to know why.

3	I do see your point Mr Phes, but 1?

3	I would like to know why he/she thinks Sabre Island is worth so little!

3	I gave this one a 5.

3	It's one of the little pirate sets I had during my youth and I loved it for several reasons.

3	First of all, it contains 2 of my favorite minifigs!

3	It can be used as a small independent base or in combination with one of the bigger sets (Eldorado or Trading posts) as a lookup or outer defense.

3	Besides all that, this set just looks beautiful.

3	I love the colors (blue baseplate and the white/yellow tower).

3	One of the best little/medium sized sets ever made by Lego!

3	I give it a 4, only because there are no pirates.

3	I aways loved this set, nice little fortifaction.

3	Lots of details.

3	I only wish I could have worked it in Aberbrick.

2	Remind us what Aberbrick is Mr Radar... Or better still give us a link and give your MOC plug X-D

2	I will post pics of the results one day if all goes to plan.

2	Steve Hmm, maybe, although a catapult doesn't really fit in to that time period all that well.

2	Did I hear right?

2	A catapult in the 16th/17th/18th and 19th centuries?

2	*wacko* Perhaps it's an appeal for Lord of Pies to have his own personal catapult to pelt the pirates with whipped cream pastries should they try to sail past.

2	But this begs the question... why waste perfectly good pie on those scurvy, mangy, mutt-faced villians!

2	Lord Of Pies, on Jan 3 2008, 08:51 PM, said: What a wonderful idea.... :-P A pie catapult!

2	Although it is a waste of a pie....we have ourselves a dilemma!

2	There's plenty of stale, moldy old, maggot infested grog around Eldorado Fortress, perhaps that's worth wasting on the scurvy sea-dogs afterall my men have taken to eating only coconuts brought by Islander girls in their skimpy undies!

2	X-D

3	its a fantastic set, cant think of anything wrong with it to be honest, even if the island is a bit small, the plate itself is still useful, and the rest of it is also very useful, walls can go toward a bigger fort, cannon can extend your ship, soldiers extend your army, boat extends err your boats, and the island prin is just cool

3	Its a nice set.

3	I would not mind owning one, just for the minifigs and cannon.

3	The base plate is pretty cool as well.

3	Nice review, I gave it a 4 out of 5.

3	INDEXED I'm going to have to start dodging cannon balls soon if i don't start making some pirate mocs.

3	*pirate* Anywayz, I've had my Shell Service Station set # 6378 built exactly by "the book" and sitting around for the longest time.

3	With the recent twinning of my "town" with Dr. Sinister, I needed a gas station that could handle a lot more traffic (especially military traffic and these new 6-wide vehicles X-D ).

3	Here be a thumblink to the original station at BL: I love this station so much, but it really needed some modernization.

3	The reopening of this station received a lot of attention, even the local police stopped right over.

3	One big upgrade to this station is the selling of propane tanks, which is generally a rare commodity from the lego towns i've seen.

3	X-D Also at this service station is a propane tank refilling station.

3	The milkman is our first propane customer.

3	The interior has also had an addition and many upgrades.

3	For instance, this building now has florescent lighting, a big frig in the back, and more shelf space.

3	*y* Oh look!

3	there's the officer purchasing a mountain dew.

3	Now that there's more shelf space, we can sell more than just 1x1 round yellow bricks and levers.

3	We now have available 1x1 round plates and 1x1 round cones available in multiple colors!

3	:-D With this upgraded gas station, hopefully this town will bring in more business and customers into my small town.

3	X-D P

3	:'-) I really love everything you did with this gas station.

3	It looks very cozy!!!

3	Amazing how you said you built it by the book, does that mean you didn't have the set but you used your own pieces to rebuild the thing?

3	The flourescent lighting is genius!

3	And the interior space looks just like what you'd see at those little shops.

3	I really dig the moc ;-) it gives me good ideas and now I want a gas station of my own :-P And the history behind how it was "rebuilt" and how it will improve business etc is so cool *wub*

3	... Thanx legobear.

3	It means that i have the complete set and have kept it complete until yesterday X-D Since i like the set so much, i wanted to keep the general look of it :-) P Edited by phred, 09 December 2007 - 06:27 AM.

3	Great Moc!

3	It seems you did the math when doing this one and hit the nail on the head (Which pierced a megablock causing it to self destruct) !

3	Stauder

3	That?s a be-au-ti-ful station!

3	It looks perfect from head to toe ;) You managed to keep the original feeling, yet enhanced it to match the spirit of todays city sets.

3	Congratulations!

3	And I love your Milkman Truck!

3	:D

3	That's a beautiful upgrade of a classic set!

3	The new interior is great.

3	*wub* Do you still have the tow truck?

3	A wonderful work and a neat idea with that propane tank refilling station.

3	*y* Very detailed and very charming indeed!

3	:'-)

3	NIce station Phred, love those fluorescent lights!

3	*wub* But...start dodging cannonballs now, boom, harr!

3	:-P

2	Thanx for the compliments :-$ Stauder, on Dec 9 2007, 01:47 AM, said: ... (Which pierced a megablock causing it to self destruct) !

2	Stauder YES!

2	Any destruction of a megablock is a good thing.

2	Thanx Stauder.

2	I definitely still have the truck *wub* I don't have the heart to destroy it :'-) Captain green hair, on Dec 9 2007, 11:54 AM, said: ...

3	Thank you Big Pete *wub* This set looks very good, it looks well built and the statues are nice.

3	The ark looks great and the Star Wars hieroglyphic is classic :-D Just a two things: Is Marion's face double sided?

3	It looks like a calm face on the back of the box.

3	Where do the snakes come out?

3	And about the stickers, have you tried putting them on the long bricks above the breakable walls?

3	Once again, thanks very much *wub* *y*

2	:-$ Will post a pic of the alternate face when my camera battery is charged :) Quote Where do the snakes come out?

2	They sit on a pivoting plate behind the Star Wars heiroglyphics.

2	You press down on a brick at the back and the plate drops and they fall out from underneath.

2	Quote And about the stickers, have you tried putting them on the long bricks above the breakable walls?

3	Great review!!

3	I love this set *wub* (Not only because of Marion though :-D ) It has the ark that is very cool , SW humor and lots of snakes A very cool set and perhaps my favorite so far *sweet* Damn, 3 out 4 Indy sets reviewed and isn't even 08 yet X-D P

3	Thanks for the review!

3	It looks awesome, and 10 snakes!

3	Is that box the Ark though?

3	Thanks again!

2	This is great, thanks for the review...but they're using a new skellie?

2	I thought those were just for the reanimated dead...not just skeletons.

2	Unless that skeleton is supposed to be reanimated?

2	Either way it makes me sad :'-( That marion is beautiful *wub* Worth it for the set alone!

2	And that SW reference is great X-D

3	Thanks for that cool review, Big Pete!

2	thanks oh and the inside too pleese *sweet* The ark doesn't have an inside.

2	It's just one brick built box.

3	LOL!

3	Those Star Wars heiroglyphics are awesome!

3	Were those in the movie?

3	Or is this just a joke by the Lego designers?

3	That would be the first time TLC showed any kind of reference humor!

3	The rest of the set is great too, even the skeleton and the stickers.

3	YES, that's right, I actually like those things.

3	I like the new skellies because of their posability (I'm a big supporter & user of stop-motion) and I think there's nothing wrong with stickers.

3	I mean seriously, why does everybody hate stickers so much???

3	:-| Sure, they are a pain in the megablocks to put on and, sure, they come off after a while and are never usable again, but hey, you don't have to put them on, even better, you can save them (like I do) and use them for your mocs!

3	Could somebody tell me, please?

3	I'm just curious.

3	However, as I said, nice set!

3	I might even get one.

3	Gotta love that marion with the carot torch X-D and that arc is neat too!

3	By the way, are all parts on it golden?

3	Some more pics on it would be nice as soon as your camera is recharged!

2	Peace Out!

2	As far as I know, those insignias on the arc are in the movie, too.

2	But I don?t remember if they actually were on the arc or somewhere else.

2	There are a lot of Star Wars references in all the Indiana Jones movies.

2	Looking at your name, you might find it funny to know that the Asian club of Lao Che in Temple of Doom is called "Club Obi-Wan" The plane in the first Indy has the callsign CPO, which I just found out the other day :)

3	This and Motorcycle Chase were the two sets I've wanted from the start.

3	I like how you get lots of snakes, and I'll add my snakes in too, for a Brickfilm.

3	Sometimes I like the stickers, but all my world city ones got hard and fell off :'-( I like the R2-D2.

3	Could you take a pic of any hieroglyphics in this set(Not the ones on the sticker sheet.)

3	Thanks.

3	I want to decode them.

3	My 2nd review (what a veteran) ... again, found this set via a shop assistant, in my local TRU (Portsmouth, UK) this evening.

3	Comes in at ?44.99, which, is pretty steep, but, you get quite a bit for your money.

3	Front of the Box : Back of the Box : Back of the Box Closeup : Contents : It was a nice surprise to get numbered bags ... not had a large set with numbered bags for quite a while, at least in none of the sets I've bought recently!

3	Didn't take a close up of the stickers, but I was quite disappointed that the curved pieces had stickers ... if they could print the ATT curved pieces, why not these?

3	Minifigs : Oh ... and there's a nice backprint on the Pilot figure : Now, the build was pretty good ... you build the plane first (after the minifigures).

3	Quite an interesting build in a way, becayse for a while you think the back is the front ... and then you realise, heh!

3	Now ...

3	I've not seen the film in a while, but I don't recall a guy flying a plane with a fishing rod ... don't flame me if this is what happens, see earlier point regards not seeing the film in ages!!

3	:-P After that, you build the temple in stages, starting with the entrance first, and then the holey floor section with the spears.

3	These spears are just loosely placed into technic holed bricks.

3	Quite easy to make em flick out but they can go anywhere!

3	hehe Entrance : Holey Floor & Spears : These two parts are hinged and on an angle to each other and the gap makes for a handy bottomless pit, complete with pole for Indy to swing over with his whip.

3	After that, you create the door and the ratchet mechanism to keep it raised.

3	After that, you add the runners for the ball and the swinging knives trap.

3	Swords Trap - Before : After : Finally, you build the statue that holds the efigy.

3	Nice bit of construction here, especially the way that everything falls over once the efigy is removed.

3	Do be careful when putting the curved bits on though ... it appears one of the edges on mine has slightly bent when putting it on ... nowt noticable though.

3	Temple : Preparing to steal : Run!!

3	You can see that the temple has toppled and debris has fallen all around ... And then, as he goes through the door, the door falls (he gets his hat) and then the rock ball starts a rolling!

3	Ruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun!!

3	The stickers were a pain though ... there's no room for a border around the sticker here!

3	Beware!!

3	After all that is done, you join all the pieces together and it makes more a really good playset.

3	Plenty of opportunity for recreating scenes here!

3	Idol Closeup : Total Set : Spares : Yet more spare stickers??!

3	(sorry, i've already put the spares in my box of bits!)

3	Overall, 8 out of 10 ... lots of play value and a pretty nice build.

3	Too many stickers though ... and defo poor arms for the skeletons!

3	Thanks for that fine review, Big Pete!

3	*y* A really adventurous set with a good playability and neat traps!

3	That mayaesque sticker?s also very decent.

3	I think that the box art of these Indy sets is pretty cool too with all these 'action scene' pics, nicely done, TLC.

3	Overall, a very lovely set indeed.... tomb raiding on!

3	:'-)

3	Thank you for another excellent review Big Pete!

3	*y* *y*

3	Thank you very much for another great review, Big Pete *wub* This is a good set, but I probably won't be able to afford it with all of the rest of the lego coming out in 2008 |-/ Oh, I watched this scene a few weeks ago, and the pilot is fishing while waiting for Indy to escape.

3	Thanks again you lucky lucky man :-P

2	Thanks for the great review!

2	It's cheap too ... under ?20 for all three at the moment.

1	No hovitos?

1	NO!

1	Ah well, if I get more pirate sets next year i'd use the Islanders as hovitos.

1	In the video game they have the same torsos.

1	I'd really like to get this, maybe in June I'll have luck.

1	:'-)

2	this set is pretty nice i love the idol id probably buy the set just for that :-D lol is it just me or in the earlier concepts of this set we saw a native on the box?

2	i wonder why they removed it :-( *wacko*

3	Tks so much Big Pete for thisd awsome review of yet another fantastic Indy sets !!

3	Its clearly one of the best lines of all times with SW 8-?

3	That idol is superb and I love all the details of that set: loads of cool defense mechanisms, sweet vegetation and yeay another black carrot torch :-P And those MFs are really nice !!

3	I am so happy to see Lego go dark tan *wub* Now I clearly can't wait to enjoy building this set ;-) Fertility Idol On !!

3	*yoda*

2	i just noticed another inconsistency between box art and the actual set ... on the box, the biplan has white wing supports (they're just plane windows without glass in them) and yet the set they are dark grey (or is it bley ... can never tell the difference without careful study).

2	Add to that ... the outer of the engine at the front is white on the box and black in the set.

2	We don't normally have this many inconsistencies do we ?

2	This set is so cool... and another must buy!

2	:-$ I'm in trouble next year it seems...

2	The figs are great!

2	*wub* I think the plane is only OK; perhaps they should have made that in a separate set as it needed to be a certain size to fit the figs, but that meant that the tail is way too short.

2	Here is a picture of the actual plane so you can see what I mean.

2	(Notice the pilot is fishing... ;-) ) The temple is another story; I think Lego have done an incredible job with this, fitting in the key parts of this sequence without making an absurdly large model.

2	Addtionally, there are many parts in this set that I haven't got so it shouldn't be too hard to justify.

2	X-D Thanks for another great review.

2	*sweet* I love the photo of Indy running with the idol and the boulder close behind.

2	:-/ EDIT: Yes there was one... Big Pete, on Dec 16 2007, 11:28 PM, said: We don't normally have this many inconsistencies do we ?

2	Quite annoying ones too.

2	I think the plane looks better with those being white.

3	Because of exams and other obligations, I haven't posted this sooner.

3	Seeing that no-one else has reviewed this set, I thought I might as well do it myself.

3	The set in its entire glory (minus the slammer, instructions and the (obviously) massive sticker sheet) The four cars included in this set; a muscle car, a sports car, a roadster and the police off-roader(!

3	): Because the police obviously have no clue that an off-roader is useless for catching street-racers, no less a batmobile-ish sports car, it will always trail behind: But the police have a trick up their sleeve - the drawbridge: Gotcha!

3	And the mechanism that makes it all tick: The motor is nothing more than a (slow) pull-back motor.

3	Push down the bridge, the latch will hook on to the gear and keep it in place until the latch is released.

3	And there's the new gas station.

3	Staying within theme, this gas-station is, like the tanker in 8147, from the company Fuel 4 Speed: There's a notable presence of detail here, such as the soda-dispenser, water (coolant?)

3	bottles and other accesories, two fuel pumps and bumper-level railings to prevent cars from crashing into them.

3	There's no interior however.

3	And as demonstrated here by a loyal Octan-employee and a pursuing officer, the gas station is built to minifig-scale: My impressions of this set: As a collector of tiny turbos, and yet to miss a set, I got this one regardless of what it included.

3	The gas station is indeed very nice, and the minifig-scale accesories were unexpected.

3	The lack of interior is no big issue, and the both the station and bridge can with ease be implemented into a mini-fig town.

3	The bridge also solidly built, and includes the ramps in its design, so it can be lifted, with ramps attached, without breaking apart.

3	The slammer included in the set is identical, apart from the white color, with those in 8147.

3	The cars are also very nice, altough I am yet to get used to the yellow batmobile, as I've grown accustomed to calling it.

3	I also love the off-roader's chunky tires, they make perfect wheels for the newer minifig-scale cars.

3	I never consider price/parts ratio, and here it would, for me, be irrelevant, because it will never be demolished for parts.

3	The play value is what I would consider pretty good, and while the bridge won't rise with a car on it, it's still strong enough to stay open with a car tipping over the edge.

3	Hmm.

3	Every nerve in my body is saying that this sets is worth roughly 8/10, so: Verdict: 8/10 Edited by WhiteFang, 23 May 2009 - 07:01 PM.

3	Indexed

2	Looks like a nice set, I like the tiny turbos and have most of the older individual cars, but I am put off by the ever increasing price of the large sets with lots of extra parts that I'm not really interested in.

2	I wish these were available as individual vehicles as well.

3	Thanks for the review!

3	It's really cool that the petrol station is mini-fig scaled, I wasn't expecting that!

3	:-D ~Peace

3	It looks like a nice set but I'm not interested in the minis, it's got a nice drawbridge though!

3	Thanks!

3	*sweet*

2	I want this set but its $60 AUD which is a ripp off!

2	i like the yellow car!

2	(hammer not included!)

2	Wheel it into position Time to start mixing, also time for a well earned Tea Break, The cement is all ready now.

2	And the 2 left over bits.

2	Extra cement is always useful and not really wasted.

2	Overall, a nice little set and I am pleased to see little sets appearing again at long last.

2	The only negative is with the drum of the mixer, although the angle can be adjusted you cannot tip the contents out of the mixer.

2	All in all I would say 8/10 for a good little set?

2	Comments...?

2	?

2	?

2	Edit by Hobbes: Replaced pictures with clickable thumbs and corrected set number.

3	great review and nice touch putting the minifig in the mixer *y* and i think you are the first to review this set so all in all good work.

3	steel...

1	Aww man!

1	I hate that face.

1	It doesn't match any of my other lego heads!

1	In my opinion, it's not even lego-ey.

2	Thanks for the review.

2	I will probably miss this set as I have too many workers already!

2	I have a few of this head...

2	It's one of the multipurpose heads, it's even been used as a viking!

2	*wacko*

2	Thanks for the very thorough review!

2	Looks good, but I see they didn't include the new 4x4x1/3 circle piece.

2	Ah well, did you see/buy any other Impulse sets?

2	~Peace

3	i tink its better if you resize the pics before uploading to ur brickshelf account.

3	Picasa2 is a good tool to resize ur pics.

3	use the "export" function.

3	;-) Anyway, nice review!

3	Looks like i will be getting all of the CITY impulse sets except for the Fire fighter one.

3	Maybe more of those Large Bin sets.

3	heh.. thanks for the pics!

3	Is it possible if you scan the rest of the sets at the back of the manual?

3	Thanks in advance!

3	:-D

2	Thanks for the review.

2	Does anyone know if these mini sets are sold at TRU?

3	OMG I absolutely love how you reviewed this set, I think you are the only person I've ever seen on Eurobrick with such a thorough review.

3	I read Eurobricks daily and this really raises the bar in terms of how a person does a review.

3	Please do not resize your pics, they are perfect, crisp, large, thorough, and clear; it gives anyone who really wants info on the set just about everything they need to know about it.

3	I had no idea they used that lil "thing" to have the cement mixer spin, cool idea ;-) .

3	Nice set, but perfect perfect review.

3	Thanks much!

3	X-D

2	Thanks for the review, this looks like a nice set to have multiple copies of...

2	I think that you may have mistyped the setnumber, as I was expecting this cute car when I read the title (I wondered how you could see a cementmixer in this set...) :-P

3	Heres all the parts in assorted baggies, and the horribly messed up instructions.

3	Four astronauts and four aliens, with an extra gold visor (yay!)

3	Not bad.

3	The base of the horribly unstable alien craft.

3	The wings move up and down, aswell as back and forth, the purpose I know not.

3	Next we build the nerf section of the base.

3	Basically technic.

3	And the rest of the tube connectors.

3	Heres the farthest I got the little missle to go.

3	Its fairly dissapointing.

3	Good thing I didnt expect much from this portion of the set.

3	Heres the start of the command base.

3	More of the main structure, will be adding lots of things to all the little beams.

3	Heres a storage container and the surprisingly not flimsy radar.

3	On this side we see the alien elevator.

3	It uses a HORRIBLY long technic rod, I have not seen one of this proportion, its like, a foot and a half long.

3	More of the inner base where all the little tubes shall go.

3	All the connected tubes and such.

3	I also encountered a problem.

3	In the instructions it says for the end of the elevator prong to be touching the tube connector where it is shown here, but mine has a 1x space inbetween.

3	No matter.

3	Heres the completed base.

3	+ My knee.

3	Again.

3	Onto the spaceship.

3	The bulk of it is just technic supporting beams, with some large slope peices covering it all up.

3	More on that later.

3	The white coverup.

3	The middle section lifts up to store the overly large jetpack.

3	As you see, the storage containers take up most the bulk in the back, and you can see the jetpack on the ground.

3	Aswell as the trigger hand hold thing that allows you to swoosh it.

3	Look, in the back!

3	Lego Greebles!

3	Despite the large cockpit, it only holds one person, laying down.

3	The wings are really the saving grace - double layered with a nice two toned effect.

3	Kitty nudged me this picture so its abit blurry, my apologies :-| Extra peices and or peices I have no idea where the hell they go.

3	:-P Overall, the set is quite fun I must admit.

3	Full price, I probably would not go for it, But I got it for just under 70 dollars.

3	For that price I can confidently say its quite worth it, many useful peices, nice figures (other than the aliens) and the tube things are quite fun to boot, even though I liked the life on mars system more, which I also have.

3	None the less, its very fun to make them shoot around.

3	Alright, so its not much of a command base either, and it looks abit bare.

3	But it's still fun, even if you ignore the nerf section.

3	Overall I give it a hardy 3.5 out of 5, the openness and epic fail of a missile launcher are hard to get by, but overall, its a dandy set :-D Merry Christmas *wub*

1	Thanks for the review Brickmaster!

1	I wanted this set at first but I realized I don't want it as much anymore, seems like a waste of 90$.

1	:-(

2	I just want the ship...Just the ship.

2	I don't recall mine having an alignment problem on the tubes... could you perhaps take a closer picture of the area?

2	Did yours also have two of the same sticker for the wings of the alien craft?

3	Thanks for this review.

3	Lots of minifigs is a plus, although half of them are junk jellies, but dang the base just doesn't seem impressive.

3	It looks so cheap, like a skeleton.

3	The tubes are just ridiculous.

3	But hey, at least it comes with two cool spacecraft, that's nice.

2	I agree, it does seem very scarce, but Ive taken apart the nerf launcher, made a new module with the tube the launcher used, and beefed up the base with some computers and other things.

2	For 90 dollars I would pass, I agree.

2	On sale it is lovely, though.

2	And none the less ive been entertained for ages with them flyin through the tubes :-D

2	Thanks for the review Brickmaster!

2	This set looks nice, I really like the orange (*wub*) and white colour scheme, although the purple of the LoM base was very cool too.

2	I only have the LoM base, if you have it built could you show a comparison?

2	On an unrelated note, by the time I realised the red and blue hangers on the LoM base were for the red and blue mechs, the mechs were no longer in stores.

2	:'-( I was a bit slow, huh?

2	:-P Anywho, this is one set I won't be buying, although if the rocket was sold separately I'd get that.

2	:-D Thanks again.

2	*y* ~Peace

3	Should be here's the completed base and my Knee In Cordoroys (sp?)

3	Great review.

3	Thanks for the photos and review Brickmaster.

3	I'm hoping to find this on sale as well... no luck so far.

3	I love the white ship, and I think the base would be amusing, but ultimately hard to re-use.

3	Incidentally, that long axel is common in recent technic sets, but I think it was orignally made for the hockey sets.

3	:-D

3	Set 7741.

3	The box: Back: Cool pose on back: The insides: The DSS: Theres acually a printed piece: The new handcuff piece with SB in the back: The finished product: The inventory: Police page: The mail page: Is this a new air plane?

3	: The fireman page: The back: A future doctor hair piece?

3	: Price: 5/5 Play: 5/5 Overall: 5/5 I *wub* it!!!!

3	!

2	Lol, "Polizei" is GERMAN for police.

3	I quite like it, but I feel that my lego city is getting over-run with helicopters and planes.

3	Also I have got the helicopter from the 7237 police station set, but it is not as good as this Plus I'am sooooo dissapointed that the :-X stickers :-X are blue instead of black and green as they will not fit with the sets I have already got :-D Nice review thanks Edited by Caseyref, 26 December 2007 - 02:04 AM.

2	Cool review, thanks!

2	And I think that doctor hair piece isn't hinting at anything new, just some cartoony stuff for the pic.

3	Thanks for the review PSPguy.

3	I think this is a very nice little chopper... but the biggest reason why I will probably get this is for the handcuffs!

3	:-D Are the side windows flush like the old ones or recessed like the new ones are supposed to me?

2	i just have one question for you, in bottom right picture on the back of the box what is the policeman putting in the container.

2	thanks in advance!

2	The binoculers.

2	:-) You must have a small moniter.

2	Nice Review *y* i will get 2 of these at the least especialy since they're going to be $15 AUD *wub* :'-)

2	A nice simple Helicopter!

2	I always had thoughts of this, but after the review I'm gonna go get it!

2	(Well, not at the moment... X-O )

3	PSPguy, on Dec 27 2007, 03:08 AM, said: What?

3	If your asking how they are but together you snap the window piece into the ho\lder.

3	Errr.... no.

3	As Brikbitz said on his site in the 7732 postal plane review... Quote You can see the traditional airplane window piece, but the bad news is they've changed the window pane.

3	It's the new flat piece used in 4996 Beach House, it just doesn't work as well.

3	Without the original bevelled edge it doesn't seal the window and there is small noticable gap around the edge.

3	Not a major problem but it might get a bit draughty inside and certainly no high altitude flying.

3	I was wondering if it is the old or new type.

3	(The look recessed to me.

3	:-/ ) They're definitely recessed new windows in this set I'm afraid, just in case no-one has answered your question yet.

3	I got this set in Woolworths the other day.

3	Tescos have it too now.

3	I have to say it's my all time favourite Police helicopter.

3	Nice review PSP guy!

3	So here it is, the long expected ;-) review of the town plan: I bought it at the Legostore Riem Arcaden last Saturday.

3	I paid 149,99 EUR for 1981 pieces.

3	This set is separated in 4 parts.

3	1: the Service/Gasstation 2: the cars.

3	the petrol pump and the fountain 3: the cinema 4: the town hall The Service Station has a lot of really nice details, like tools for the car repair, or the table with the cashpoint and the foodstation (there?s a croissant, a banana and a apple in this set).

3	One of my favourit parts is the trolley with some tools, you can see it at brickshelf.

3	At the second part are only a few pieces and i needed not much time to built the 2 cars, the fountain and the petrol pump.

3	There?s something at the truck i don?t understand.. maybe i did something wrong.. but.. the truck has no backlights.. *wacko* I like the petrol pump, that?s why i post a pic of it: The cinema is the highlight for me.

3	It has also really nice details, like the popcorn table or the gumball or candy machine.

3	The colours sheme is really nice, the front of the building with the big displays is a cool idea.

3	Overall a really nice building.

3	The town hall has also a really nice colour sheme, i love that dark green mixed with the white stairs.

3	A lot of plants around and in the town hall.

3	As you can see some figs who married there.

3	Not more to say about this building.

3	See the pics and enjoy it: Overall this set is a must have!!

3	It was really fun to built it.

3	This set reminds me of the Back to the Future movie with Michael J.

3	Fox.

3	The whole gallery is at Brickshelf, there you can find a few more pics.

3	I hope you enjoyed this review.

3	Regards Sandra

3	Great review Sandra, thanks for taking the time.

3	I love the theatre and the town hall, and the married couple is just a cute little extra *wub* This looks fantastic not only for the model, but for parts as well!

3	Thank you for the great review Sandra *y* .

3	I *wub* the detail that TLC added to this set.

3	I would like to add that I think all the buildings look *sweet* .

3	I really like how you compared the look to "Back to the Future".

3	When I saw the first pics, I thought the same thing.

3	The look of the set is definitly the 1950's.

3	I am :-( to see the price though.

3	I am sure this set will be $149.99 US too.

3	GREAT REVIEW, Model On!

3	!

3	Thank you for the review Sandra!

3	This set looks finally nice, better than my first view.

3	I really need it, I've already planed to integrate it to my new layout...

3	It will be hard to wait for it!

3	Thank you very much for the wonderful review, Legocastlegirl!

3	Plenty of pics, thanks again!

3	*wub* *y* ~Peace

3	Axle, on Dec 28 2007, 02:07 PM, said: Can you take a picture(s) of all the film posters?

3	There?s no necessity to take pics of all the film posters.

3	There are only 3 different film posters at the set.

3	Always one poster twice.. and you can see every different poster at the brickshelf gallery.

3	If you need more details, then you should maybe buy it :-) Regards Sandra

3	Awesome!!

3	I love the intierior of the Theater!

3	Really good reveiw!

3	I enjoyed seeing this review.

3	Nice to get some different angles on the components.

3	Sorry to disagree with anyone however, but this was not a great review.

3	I appreciate the effort Sandra made but a great review would include more details such as what are stickers and what are printed pieces.

3	A great review points out flaws or limitations as well as what works or is really neat.

3	A great review would have analyzed the price per piece and compared that to other sets/themes.

3	One might look at the recent reviews of the Indy sets or the new Spongebob sets as examples of really good reviews.

3	The pictures are good but a great review, above all, should provide the reader with some new information, perhaps even answer questions posed in the pre-release discussion thread.

3	I learned nothing new about the set from this review.

3	That said, it was a good review for someone who had not seen the pre-release discussion and she did a good job of showing said person what they could expect in the set.

3	I see the service station has a full arry of tools, oxy/fuel torch and other goodies.

3	not a bad set, still very pricey :-/

3	Thank you for the review

3	Very good review, thanks!!!!!!!!

3	This set is a true thing of beauty ;-) I love the vehicles and all the sweet details added to render that gklorious 50's atmosphere ;-) I love thge Town Hall, its very cleverly built and looks great 8-?

3	My favoprite part of the whole bunch has to be the movie theater wich is superb *wub* I guess its pocorn time :-P PS: @ tedbeard - do tone it down youg man !!

3	If you're not happy with Sandra's work, do provide one yourself instead of bitching on how YOU view a review and on how Sandra's post is veryt far from one (according to you !!)

3	*yoda*

3	Thanks for the review Legocastlegirl - excellent work *y*!

3	I agree with you, the best part seems to be the movietheater!!

3	That?s perfect because I just love to watch movies in the theater, so far this year I?ve seen 46 pictures (and had some pop-corn to ;-)).

3	This is a must-get-set!!

3	Town On copmike

3	Really cool review: I have got so much to do that I even did not know that set is already available.

3	It was my third review i made and i have to say that i made this review not for analyses, just only to show the EB Members some nice pics and to tell them my opinion.

3	Lego is fun for me!!

3	I don?t like to analyse the pieces, bricks, prices, colours.

3	I just want to build something.

3	That?s why i?m at Eurobricks and not at an other big legocommunity in Germany.

3	Lego is fun, fun, fun!!

3	And everybody knows that lego is a expensive hobbie.. so why should i write it again and again?

3	Oh...

3	I want this sooooooo bad!!

3	!

3	Nice review - thx for all the pics.

3	They certainly made me consider getting this set.

3	KimT BTW: which set would You recommend: Market Streeet, Town Plan or Cafe Corner?

3	Just curious.

3	They're pretty expensive and I might only afford one of them.

3	I guess it all depends on what you are after Kim.

3	If you want a really great and detailed set I would opt for the Cafe Corner, but if you want a set that can easilly be included in a city I would opt for Town Plan.

3	Since I can't afford all of them, I will just get Town Plan, because I lve the feeling of thge set and that theater is superb !!

3	They're pretty expensive and I might only afford one of them.

3	Definitely the Coffee corner.

3	It?s a hard desicion between Coffee Corner and Town Plan, because they are both really great sets.

3	The Market Street is no "must have" in my opinion.

3	But the other two.

3	Maybe you should start with the Coffee Corner, it?s the older set.

3	The Town Plan is newer and will be available longer then the Coffee Corner.

3	I hope it helped you a litte bit :-$ Regards Sandra Edited by Legocastlegirl, 04 January 2008 - 10:43 AM.

3	I felt that given the somewhat juvenile "OMG, BEST...REVIEW...EVER" tone that was creeping in amongst the replys, that it needed to be tempered with some thoughtful suggestions as to how a good review could be made great.

3	Your ad hominem approach is offensive and far more negative than I was and to suggest I should do my own review is ridiculous.

3	I live in Canada and we do not even have the set available here yet thus I am interested in seeing reviews of this set.

3	If I already had the set I would not be so interested.

3	And next time you propose to critique a critique perhaps you should actually read what I wrote.

3	I said she wrote a good review for a specific audience.

3	I did NOT say it was awful or whatever you seem to have assumed I meant.

3	Saying something is good but could be improved can hardly be characterized as "bitching".

3	:-|

3	Thanks for the review.

3	I really want this set because: 1.

3	It looks fantastic 2.

3	Has harder to find colors 3.

3	Is a 50th anniversary commemorative 4.

3	Some of the models are based on the 50s sets (i love the old stuff) The tanker truck is a perfect recreation of the old HO 1:87 scale Esso Tanker Truck.

3	I have one, and you can look at it for comparison if you would like.

3	Lego HO vehicles I'd like to modify the truck from this new set to look even more like the old Esso truck, getting rid of the green and adding some decals.

3	Happy New Year, everyone!

3	I went to my local Wal-mart looking for an exclusive Bionicle set yesterday, but was amazed to find everything there- SW, Bionicle, EF, Indie, the works.

3	I nabbed the JSF and the Rogue Shadow and scampered home to take pics with my new camera.

3	*wub* The box: The same as the other '07 boxes.

3	Nothing new.

3	The back shows the various features, with "pop out R2."

3	:-| Luckily, the intruction booklet and the DSS were intact- not folded like the last MM set I got.

3	|-/ The DSS: Not too bad, but printed parts would have been great.

3	The figs.

3	Anakin is amazing, IMO.

3	*wub* Fits the CW Anie great.

3	I noticed on the S@H reviews the kiddies were saying how ugly he looked.

3	|-/ They need to see the CW cartoon.

3	For the sake of my health, I should probably stop reading those.

3	:-D The build.

3	I won't go too in-depth on the build, since *vader* posted a very in-depth review here.

3	The start of the build: The body of the fighter starts out long and skinny.

3	The JSF's landing gear allows it to sit comfortably without getting in the way while swooshing.

3	R2-D2's launching device.

3	R2 in position.

3	When launched...

3	...He often gets stuck if you don't press the button hard enough.

3	:-/ Looks like R2 needs to lay off... whatever it is robots eat.

3	So far: The flag stickered.

3	It's a big sucker sticker.

3	Completed.

3	I forgot to add the nose stickers before I took the pic.

3	Warning- the nose cone sticker is actually two stickers.

3	I thought it was one, peeled of one of the stickers, and put it on the middle of the two 1x8 plates, and didn't notice the other sticker.

3	*wacko* Various completed shots: I think this was a beautiful little set.

3	R2's launching unit and the flick missiles are annoying, but easily fixed.

3	I plan to add proper cannons in place of the flick missiles.

3	Anakin is a great minifig, but he doesn't look so well standing next to my other figs.

3	The Brickshelf Gallery (when public) Will

3	Tks Will for your great review !!

3	G after reading *vader* 's reviews (of that set and the RS) and yours I really can't wait to get that set and all of the SW sets :-P Really nice photography there which is sweet !!

3	*yoda*

3	Thanks Will!

3	This really is a nice set!

3	Your new camera and the backround looks great, the pic quality is very good!

3	Thanks!!

3	*y*

3	Thanks for the review, Mr. Mandalorian!

3	This set looks very nice, and it's good to know the nose cone stickers are 2 separate ones, so they don't cross bricks.

3	:-D That camera is working out great for ya'!

3	Thanks again!

3	~Peace

3	Thanks for the reveiw on this great set!

3	I actually just came home from TRU with this, maybe 1/2 hour ago!

3	Funny!

3	Love the new hair sculpt!

3	*wub*

3	Great Review!!

3	I still don't like that Cartoon Anakin though :-/ Excuse me for a sec *Runs to local Wal-mart to check" :-D Buying 08 Sets On!

3	P

3	this is a brilliant review of a brilliant set!

3	*sweet* thanks a lot!

3	i know this may be a bit much to ask but could take some pics of the whole instruction booklet?

3	please!!!

3	if you can thanks a bunch.

3	but if not do know of a place where i could find the instructions?

3	Thanks, guys!

3	I have the Rogue Shadow in the review pipes, should be up soon.

3	:-/ If you check *vader* 's review, he has a lot of pics of the build, that might work just as well.

3	Will

3	ok i thought it might be to much to ask.

3	i will try *vader* 's review.

3	and again thanks for the review *y*

3	Than kyou for the review.

3	I don't know if I buy this set now I know there's also a Anakin in the AT-TE with a new jedi, but who knows.

3	Wow, I'm surprised no one had done this already.

3	First off, this is a truly lovely set that many people should own, even though it's SOLD OUT on the S@H :'-( .

3	now lets start off with an overview.

3	*Note*: I was missing a few of the pieces (the rabbit, the trike) when I toke the pics.

3	The figs and a cat.

3	The engine: I really love this thing.

3	It's a beautiful 0-6-0 steam engine with a tender.

3	This is probably the most detailed steam engine Lego has given us.

3	I loved it so much, I made a non-holiday version for my town.

3	The flat cars: I like these, but they seem a bit simple.

3	Their cargo is good for Christmas or a birthday party.

3	The passenger car: It resembles the green passenger car we got a while back, but I like the interior in this one a bit better.

3	The caboose: a simple caboose like the one from 2001. the sad thing about it is thats there is no interior and it's hard to take the roof off.

3	Overall: I like this set, but it is kind of hard to use during the non winter months.

3	The price is kind of good, but with that price, it should have came with the motor.

3	I give it a 9/10 Happy New Year!

3	Thanks!

3	*sweet* *y*

3	Thanks for the review AgentRick57.

3	It is a beautiful set, and quite cheap for me; $50 AUD for 965 parts!

3	8-?

3	Not sure what I will do with the rabbit though; it is huge!

3	:-D (I was considering doing this review myself but Sinnerton is a mess... :-/ )

2	NO I need it!

2	I lost my rabbit in the great void known as the large old brown box of doom(L.O.B.B.O.D for short)!!!!!

2	Exobuilder, on Jan 4 2008, 10:46 AM, said: I will gladly have your rabbit!

2	I'll probably use it as a were-rabbit.

2	these jokes are killing me X-D

3	Thanks for the good review, I wish I had bought one when it was going for only ?24.99 on LSAH instead of the usual price of ?50!

3	I got that set from my grandma on x-mas.

3	She ordered it early.

3	I really like the presesnts and that blue thing.

3	3 wheeler?

3	Here in america, It's 100$$.

3	Ouch.

3	I like the rabbit.

3	Whats with the rats in the trees and the cargo train?

3	Nice review.

3	Edited by ~VBBN~, 04 January 2008 - 01:31 PM.

3	Dang it, I meant to try to get one of these after Christmas ...

3	I knew they were half-off at S@H and I just forgot.

3	Now they're sold out.

3	Darn!

3	Thanks for the review!

3	this is a nice set X-O i managed to get 6 of em' before thay sold out :-$

2	Blah.

2	I wanted one of these at half off but I forgot and missed out.

2	Thanks for the review though :-$

3	I was fortunate enough to get one along with the Hobby Train.

3	They are the first trains I have ever owned (mainly by virtue of them having been half price).

3	It's a fantastic selection of parts with the Holiday Train, as well as it really looking the part as a set.

3	I'm happy not to get a motor; as I think the 9V setup would prove expensive, and the IR control system for the RC setup seems a bit poor.

3	I got some "dead" track for with it to have just as a push train for now.

3	Got one for 90 USD, one of the best trains ever..Funny as train, perfect for parts.

3	What else to say.

3	*y*

3	Okie guys and gals, here s time for some droid exploration with my review of set 7670.

3	As a general statement I have to say its really a neat set that is not that expensive for what it holds.

3	1) Box art Like always I will start with pics of the box art.

3	BTW, notice anything guys ?

3	No bloody crappy DSS.

3	Yes, finally a set without stickers and that feels great :-D 2) The Mfs Nothing really spectacular there.

3	The only novelty lies within the inclusion of the new Commander (yellow torso) BD.

3	Apart from that, there are 2 BDs and unfortunately yet another SBD (I like those but I have a huge amount of them, and I would rather had something different).

3	You have 3 short blasters and a couple of extra parts.

3	3) The Spider Droid I think it?s a pretty cool little buggar.

3	It?s a rather simple yet classic construction I think.

3	It has sweet parts such as the BD body in dark bley.

3	It really has a spider feel unlike the previous Ep3 one.

3	4) The Hailfire Droid This baby represents the ?pi?ce de resistance?

3	of this set.

3	I truly love it !!

3	Sure it?s a bit under scale but I don?t really mind that.

3	Its conception is superb even if I totally dislike assembling those technic treads (especially 80 of those small things).

3	The ellipse of the treads is well balanced and that trans disc is a brilliant idea.

3	The great thing is those new flick fire missiles: they don?t fall unlike the other ones and they do look good on this baby.

3	Also you can put the wheels together and the missiles to gain some shelf space (easy storage ON :-D ) In conclusion those druids re really sweet and are perfect target practice for the upcoming RGS hehe !!

3	I hope you enjoyed that review and do not hesitate to comment and ask pic requests if any ;-) *yoda*

3	Hey, Thanks for the review!

3	I think I will definately get this set!

3	It comes with 2x 79 thread pieces... *wacko* ;-) Thanks for the review, I'll definitively get this set (maybe monday :'-) ), love those droids *wub*

2	Painful memories X-D I think they are great looking but what a pain to assemble !!

2	Especially the tiny ones.

2	At lzaest the Bat Tank had the larger ones ;-) *yoda*

3	I totally like this set *wub*!

3	I bought it some days ago ,it looks really nice together with the MTT.

2	a druid battle pack would also be a nice idea for the castle sets.

2	Thank for the nice review with many pictures.

2	May I ask what you paid for this?

2	My first (and second) idea was that 25 euro was a bit to much for this.

2	:-)

2	They released the battle droid commander in 2000 :-|

2	Trudop561, on Jan 5 2008, 04:21 PM, said: They released the battle droid commander in 2000 :-| While there was a yellow-marked battle droid officer in the 3343 minifigure pack released in 2000, the battle droid commander from 7670 is different.

2	The new 7670 commander has a torso made of all yellow plastic, whereas the 2000 battle droid commander had a tan torso with yellow printings, and a tan head with yellow printings.

2	So, while we have had a BD commander before, the 7670 commander is "new."

2	My first (and second) idea was that 25 euro was a bit to much for this.

2	:-) X-D whatever :-P Bloody typo I say.

2	However, the upcomming Castle Advent calendar might include druids :-P I paid 30?

2	for it ;-) (dang 1 cent more expensive as S@H :-D ) Trudop561, on Jan 5 2008, 11:21 PM, said: They released the battle droid commander in 2000 :-| Yes, another nice tone, meessa so happy !!

2	First, you are very welcome for my review of a set present in your wishlist.

2	Then the Commander you are talking about has a tan body with oreange markings only (check !!)

2	and the commander here has a full YELLOW body like in the Spiderman set Doc Oc's hideout (4856) !!

2	Therefore those 2 Commanders are 2 different MFs.

2	*yoda*

3	Yeah finally *yoda* got his SW :-D I got 2 of them after X mas - they are really cool - especially the Spider Droid!

3	2 of them On!

3	& Happy *yoda* On :-P Edited by aayla-secura, 05 January 2008 - 10:38 PM.

2	You thought the Bat Tank was bad, The Tie Crawler has 81 for each of the sides *sing*.

2	and don't get me started on the Sand Crawler!

2	:-X

2	Nice Review!

2	And you finally got an 08 set!

2	I haven't gotten any, I blame Wal-mart for putting products out late |-/ :-D Instead of a SBD, TLC should have included a Droideka(New Version) *y* The scale is a bit off, so this is a Dwarf Hailfire droid :-P P

2	thanks for the reveiw, i've got one of these and an AT-AP in the mail hopefully arriveing tomorrow :-) Edited by legoman, 06 January 2008 - 12:15 AM.

2	Nive Review of it Yoda..

2	But i was going to do a review of it..

2	But now i see this..

2	I don't want to do it anymore.. :'-( Next time..

2	Try to do it with action.. [It is rare that people do that, they only do it with the set and not further..] ;-)

1	Nice review, thanks.

1	It still seems overpriced to me though.

1	Also, the box shows the droid torsos that are used for "feet" on the Spider Droid as being light bley, yet they are clearly dark bley.

1	*wacko* TK

2	Great review mate as usual, for me the highlight of this set has to be the new spider droid.

2	Even though it's made up of some strange parts it really appeals to me, i would love a few of those babys.

2	The Hellfire droid is also well put together even if it is a little small, but hey it looks fun.

2	I really like the look of this set but the price tag really puts me off, why oh why did lego price it so high.... :'-(

2	great review very precise.

2	as for the spider droid construction, i have already worked it into a moc: http://www.brickshel...ry.cgi?f=290980 stryker-single gun hydra-seven guns hammer-missile pods.

2	steel...

3	Thanks for the great reveiw *yoda* Fantastic pictures (Very crisp) I am now going onto bricklink to purchse to because you have reasured me that this is a good set.

3	Ashoka~

3	Great review, as we've come to expect from *yoda* *y* Nice to see that TLG is finding new and interesting ways to get around the "no minifig only" sets restrictions with Hasbro.

3	Clearly, this is another army builder with a minimal vehicle as we're becoming accustomed to.

3	Heck, even the diminutive Hailfire is technically a droid as well, thus making this all minifigs, from a certain point of view.

3	Only negative: It is a bit overpriced.

3	I'll have a better feel for that when I get one.

3	Treads/links always drive up a price, so it might just be fair.

3	The spiderdroid is a winner, even with the unusual parts assortment.

3	I like it when LEGO thinks of different ways to use things, I think it promotes the same from us.

3	I'm not sure what I think of the new battledroid commanders, but at least I can make extras easily if I need to, as I bought a bunch of yellow droid bodies off Bricklink once, thinking I might want to make some kind of new droid out of them.

3	They were cheap at the time, now I expect the price to go up just because of this potential use.

3	Between those and the grey ones, it's good to see more becoming available.

3	Hopefully we'll see black and a few other colours produced for some nice customizing possibilities.

3	All in all, a nice little set with a great army building potential, especially on a buy-one-get-one-half-off or better type of sale.

3	Until then, I'll grab one or two and be glad to have them.

3	I got this set for a few months [1 or 2].. And i agree that it is small..

3	But still..

3	It looks great on plates, clone troopers [Just for fun..] >:-)

1	i got this and a couple of other sets on monday.and to tell you the truth, i was a bit dissapointed.i like the set, i like the parts, but it's definitly not worth it's RRP of $45 NZD, if you ask me i should be more like $35 NZD, but hey, i still like it, i got it for $30 on ebay so i'm not complaining *y* *y*

2	my hailfire droid is gonna be coming in the mail soon, as well as the battlepacks.

3	Ah I finally got the 2 City sets I really wanted !!

3	I am so happy that Lego went postal on us :-P .

3	Since they are rather small I shall do a mix review of these 2 sweet sweet sets.

3	1) Mail Van (7731) Like always I?ll start with shots of the box art and bloody DSS.

3	Now here are the extras of that set: I really love the new torso of the postal worker.

3	My huge grip lies on the mail box: that mail logo is a freaking sticker !!

3	For that part I was so expecting a printed part.

3	That is really really bad !!

3	Apart from that the design is pretty cool.

3	The van is quite simple but I think its pretty cute.

3	I love the fact that the rear is a window.

3	2) Air Mail (7732) Like always I?ll start with shots of the box art and bloody DSS.

3	The extras are OK: another great postal worker.

3	You also have yet another red trolley with a package that is a bloody sticker yet again !!

3	G TLC should have more printed parts !!

3	That plane for me is a classic thing of beauty !!

3	Really is consistent with the fantastic planes of the 80?s.

3	That?s the kind of lanes TLC should produce instead of those huge Playmo planes.

3	Actually I am happy that TLC released that one ?

3	for once its not a bloody airline exclusive promo set !!

3	Here are general pics.

3	I love the engines of the plane: simple yet superb.

3	Also the top hatch opens to insert mail and packages.

3	The front control panel is a printed part !!

3	I love the classic double train windows and here is a poc of the undeneath of the set.

3	In conclusion I truly love these small sets: they are the perfect size (4 wide car yeay !!)

3	and the colour pattern is amazing as well.

3	I hope you enjoyed that review and do not hesitate to comment and ask pic requests if any ;-) *yoda*

3	Great review Yoda.

3	Thanks for sharing.

3	I wasn't real fond of the postal truck at first.

3	It's so different than those in the US.

3	But after seeing your close-up images (esp.

3	the back of the tuck), it looks really neat.

3	I also like the mail box a lot.

3	It looks good in red.

3	Too bad for the stickers, but it's still nice.

3	The plane reminds me a lot of the design used in the Jurassic Park set.

3	As you've said, it's similar to 80s designs.

3	I really like the brick-built design too.

3	It's just real Lego - that's about all I can say.

3	Very nice sets that are a must together.

3	Thanks for the review.

3	Excellent review.

3	You convinced me to buy these two.

3	Could you tell me how much you payed for them?

3	I think I'm gonna buy them tomorrow if they have it already (or if I don't see any cooler sets).

3	I haven't spotted these in the US yet.

3	I'm looking forward to finding them.

3	Overall, the 2008 line-up is a excellent and it's going to be difficult for me to decide which themes/sets to pursue.

3	There's a lot to choose from.

3	Thanks for the great review *yoda* .

3	I'm definitely going to get that plane, I've sadly only owned one of the many Lego planes there is.

3	Where do you live?

3	Nice review yoda I dont think I have ever read one with as much cursing of stickers!

3	:-D I love these two little sets, the colour scheme the little different wheels on the post van and of course the new postmen uniforms!

3	Would have been nice if they had included little satchels like in the new indiana jones sets, oh well!

3	;-) postman Yoda on!

3	*yoda*

3	Thanks for the takes on these two sets, Yoda.

3	Stickers or not, I still think these are charming sets with all the essence and nostalgia of the older sets back in the 80/90's.

3	Am I the first one to notice the new doors used in the back of the van.

3	Not only is it using the popular new frame, but the old container doors have been redesigned to fit with the new frame as well.

3	Pity they're not yellow, though.

3	Very nice, cheers Yoda!

3	I'll definitely be getting the post van, not sure about the plane though.

3	Both are awesome, but I think I have enough planes... Can you tell me though, the wheels on the van, are they rubber or plastic?

3	They look a bit tacky...

3	these little sets are really nice!

3	they cought my eye the minute i saw them!

3	it would have been SO great if there was a post office to go with them!

3	there are so few buildings in lego city the design is very classic and i am ofcourse considering to get them but it seems that i have a lot of small cars and planes on my desk!

3	:-$ recently i took a flight with Cyprus Airways from Thessaloniki to Cyprus and the two promo plane sets were there!

3	I was so tired though that i couldnt stay awake to buy them!

3	im taking a flight again on Tuesday and i hope they are not out of stock!!

3	thanks for a great review Yoda!

3	a fine job as always!

3	cant wait for your next one

3	Aww man, is TLC really getting too cheap for printed parts?

3	Shame on you TLC!!

3	Despite those stickers these are two really neat sets.

3	Especially the airplane.

3	Classic *wub* Reminds me of that little plane my dad bought in an airplane.

3	Not sure what's the set nr..

3	The window at the rear of the van looks like a normal window frame without the clips for the shutters.

3	I never knew those existed 8-?

3	Might come handy for ship building.

3	Thanks for the review Yoda!

3	Thank you for the nice review Pity of the stickers but the design is nice 80ies on!

3	Great Review *yoda* (I find myself saying that line alot :-D ) I love these two little sets *wub* TLC continues the Great City Line that started in 07 and continues into 08 Its also nice to have other sub lines besides Fire and police :-| :-P I hope there are many more Postal Sets, like a Post office!

3	!That would be sweet!

3	Hope these are Mainstream and not those damn exclusives >:-( Postal ON!

3	P

2	Thanks for the review!

2	I was always going to get these two sets, so you haven't swayed me at all!!

2	X-D I reckon Lego could enhance this sub-theme by releasing a post motorbike (with or without a sidecar) and post office.

2	Obviouly the office would be the hub of all the activity, while the post bike would take care of the postal run.

2	This would free up the van to take or recieve bulk mail or parcels to or from the airport.

2	It could then also do the parcel deliveries around the city.

2	The office would also serve as the reciever for all the parcels the new goods truck might deliver.

2	Just some thoughts, that's all!!

2	*sweet*

2	I need to do some catching up here :-P Matn, on Jan 5 2008, 05:16 PM, said: Could you tell me how much you payed for them?

2	I think I'm gonna buy them tomorrow if they have it already (or if I don't see any cooler sets).

2	I paid a tad more than the S@H price: I paid 15 for the plane and 8 for the van (sure its a tad more expensive but I didn't want to wait for TRU to get them) Freddie, on Jan 5 2008, 06:10 PM, said: Am I the first one to notice the new doors used in the back of the van.

2	Not only is it using the popular new frame, but the old container doors have been redesigned to fit with the new frame as well.

2	Pity they're not yellow, though.

2	Great remark there, I guess I totally missed that one :-$ And I agree that yellow doors would have been better but those dark bley do not look that bad !!

2	Mr Hobbles, on Jan 5 2008, 09:10 PM, said: Can you tell me though, the wheels on the van, are they rubber or plastic?

2	They look a bit tacky... Rubber off course ;-) They do look a tad tacky but its because they are the thin type (like with the racers) and I am not a fan of those |-/ phoinix, on Jan 5 2008, 09:35 PM, said: cant wait for your next one Tks ;-) Me neither though :-P marvinblue, on Jan 6 2008, 03:31 AM, said: I reckon Lego could enhance this sub-theme by releasing a post motorbike (with or without a sidecar) and post office.

2	So true 8-?

2	At one point I was thinking of a impulse set with a yellow bike, postman, post and letters (that would rock !!).

2	I hope TLC adds to this sub theme and keeps that retro feel *wub* A yellow dirtbike with sidecar would be a sweet 5?

2	set !!

2	Also a small town feel post office would be so cool: like a 20/30?

2	set ;-) We can be sure of one thing though, this year's advent calendar will have a postamn and small post office ;-) Post On !!

2	*yoda*

3	Thanks for the review :-) I was actually considering getting these, but I saw they were overpriced for my tastes - too bad, theyre nifty lil things *wub*

3	loool : Spielberg goes on a career change :-D these are some nice sets.

3	I really love that car.

3	looks sleek

3	Thanks for a nice review and few comments to sets: Nice airplane, finally some reminiscence for Lego City Golden Era (for me years 1982-1992).

3	Everything is nice, but two things are freezing a smile on my face.

3	First of all the ugly new hinge used for plane roof.

3	I have already 4032 and those new hinges are looking really terrible when compared f.e.

3	with 6368.

3	Second one is new minifig, I don?t know what I expected, but this torso design looks too simple and too cheap..

3	Concerning new car - I appreciate fact, that TLC makes after long long years again Postal sets, but I don?t like those new-style cars.

3	Matchbox wheels and bad rate between drivers cockpit and cargo space are damping me from buying.

3	6651 Mail Truck or 105 Canada Post Truck were much better... Edited by Kanal-K1, 06 January 2008 - 07:33 PM.

2	While the plane does look nice, I don't particularly care for the van.

2	But the van does have some good parts, which is the only reason I would by one: yellow mud guards, the new windshield, and the small door on the rear.

1	Well first off, thanks yoda for the great review.

1	:-) Hmmm... Well, i have to say, i'm not at all impressed with any of these sets.

1	I mean, there nice and all, but the van just seems way to small.

1	It would have been nice if you could fit more than one package in it.

1	I guessi'm one of those that are more of the fan of the 6 wide trucks.

1	And the plane.... Hm.

1	this has a "cute" factor and all, but i mean com'on... You have to open a hatch on the roof to get your packages in??

1	And what about getting them out?

1	You have to flip the plane upside down?

1	:-| Weak.

1	They should have had a hinged rear end or a hatch on the side.

3	Yes, this is the LEGO charming!

3	No stairs in buildings, cars with just one minifig, all those things that make LEGO what it is...

3	Thanks Yoda for your review!

3	Those posts sets will be mine, but I will wait to find them in my supermarket, even if I have to wait 2 or 3 months, I know that I will save some money, so I will buy more LEGO :-D There are simple designed sets, but we don't need more: two nice litle sets that are not oversized and too expensive.

2	TheBrickster, on Jan 5 2008, 10:12 AM, said: I wasn't real fond of the postal truck at first.

2	It's so different than those in the US.

2	good point B... this design is just too foreign to my eyes for me to enjoy... i don't like either of these sets, very disapointing - the postal theme has so much potential.

2	i don't really like the torsos either - too plain/cheap as kanal suggested.

2	and i will agree that the wheels on the van look cheap.

2	i was sooooo impressed with city 2007, this is a real let down.

2	though, i am happy to see a small set with a postal box.

2	so, even though, all that aside, i'll probably buy 6 of the van - just for the yellow mudgards, postal box and stickers to populate my city.

2	and i think this set will provide some excellent piece to MOC a yellow civillian convertable with *sweet* - BM

2	I'm glad to see the mail van has the doors that used to be on the older cargo containers.

2	I had given up on those older ones, but now that they're still out there, I may invest in the older cargo system instead of the new 6-wide ones.

2	Both sets are good enough, I'll get both.

2	I'm hoping for a postal building too, even though I have the smaller of the old post offices.

2	A nice big modern one would be great.

2	I'm not too hung up about the design of the plane; I've got the neat old cargo plane with the tail that swings open (one of the best plane sets) for big packages.

2	The truck is goofy looking, but if I get sick of looking at it I can rebuild it into a classic looking one.

2	Great review by the way, the pictures are some of the better one I've seen in a review recently.

3	I see your point that more cargo capacity would have been better.

3	Nevertheless, my personal preference is for smaller "classic" scale City sets.

3	The mail van is nice and small, and should fit well with my road plates and 1990s cars from the 4561 train.

3	On a side note, did anyone notice the message on the back of both sets' boxes, "designed for easy building and instant play"?

3	It surprised me a little, since these sets seem no less complex than any other City set of late.

3	They look like quick builds, sure, but not as though the designers went out of their way to simplify them.

2	Thanks *yoda* for the great reviews.

2	I love the airplane, it's really cute.

2	The van needed to grow on me though but you did the trick.

2	I don't like the wheels of the van.

2	They will need replacing.

2	And wouldn't everything have been better if they were completely red?

2	Dr.

2	Brick

3	Thanks for the great reviews, *yoda*!

3	The car looks great.

3	*y* And the plane is very cool too, and much more suited to a Lego town than the large planes.

3	On!(?)

3	Hey everyone, my first 2008 set is this one, 5613.

3	I thought I'd share a review of it.

3	*sweet* I'd like to say sorry about my photos, they were taken quickly.

3	first, we have the box: it is the smallest lego box I've ever seen, and actually looks cute *wub* it will be heavy competition with playmobil's specials... back of the box, showing an action pose: the contents of the little box, with a very tiny instruction manual *wub* the manual unfolded.

3	Notice that every part has its part number beside it :-) the back of the manual, showing some fire sets and the other Impulse sets the parts, 30 in total: the small set built.

3	the firefighter has a small fire to extinquish, armed with an axe, chainsaw, other saw and foam... psssh thing X-D .

3	five extra parts in a 30 part set!

3	we get an extra black hatchet, yellow bar tap, light bley 1*1 plate, red 1*1 plate modified with fingers and 2*2 dark bley radar dish.

3	Besides the plate, I've never seen these as reserve parts... but I'm not complaining X-D here is a small "alternate" model I created with it: a small bbq... what?

3	He's hungry and he needs to put something on the bbq >:-) X-D Overall, you can't go wrong with these Impulse sets.

3	I paid 2.89 euros for this little set, so thats a great value!

3	Sadly the only impulse avaible were these 3 city sets (no police) and the alien Mars mission...

3	Looking forward to the knight and magician as well as those Indy sets!

3	TT

3	Cool!

3	Finally its an entire line I can actually afford to own every set!

3	:-D I can't wait to get my hands on them!

3	If its possible, could you give us the demensions of the box?

3	It would be apprectiated.

3	This is a nice little set, with 2 axes (*wub* >:-)) and some nice parts.

3	Cool alternate model too!

3	Beach House Reviewed by Dunamis Set 4996 522 Pieces $29.95 from Target Build time 90 minutes Yet another interesting Creator theme house.

3	This one comes fresh of the 2008 line of sets and promises 3 different models.

3	Packing 522 pieces (albeit a lot of 1x1 plates) for only $29.95 it was hard to pass this one by as I was foraging for the new 2008 Star Wars sets at the local Target.

3	Plus, I was itching to do another review since I had finally fully recovered from my marathon UCS Falcon review which took the better part a month to complete.

3	The Box: The box is pretty standard Creator type box which shows off the three models (beach house, Caf?

3	and ?towering?

3	apartment building.)

3	The back of the box shows some of the features of the three models.

3	Interesting features of the three models prominently displayed on the back include: - Food counter complete with coffee (espresso) maker and food warmer (with chicken leg!)

3	- Home office complete with laptop (and the ubiquitous coffee cup.)

3	- Flip up roof granting access inside of beach house.

3	Note the satellite TV dish and even rain gutters along the roofline!

3	Opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals.

3	We?re back to the reusable cereal box type tab system that we saw so often in 2007 sets.

3	Note the parts inventory is on the side of the box as well.

3	This is a nice feature.

3	Once inside the box, we are greeted by eight sealed bags plus two yellow 16x2 plates and a green 32x16 baseplate.

3	Thank goodness there is no DSS (dreaded sticker sheet) but alas there are no minifigs.

3	In addition, there are the three manuals (one for each model) and they were stuffed into my box with the care of kid trying to put 10 gallons (or liters if you prefer) of candy in a 5 gallon bucket.

3	But hey, we?re not collecting manuals here so who cares if the manuals are all bent and warped?

3	The Manuals: The three manuals are 74, 72 and 48 pages in length.

3	They are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings: - Piece call outs for each step - Parts inventory at the end of the primary model build - Page numbers Color separation in these manuals were fine for me.

3	Plus, we get the usual verbose LEGO instructions on not dumping all your pieces outside in the grass and not to dump all your pieces into a single pile.

3	Thanks for the tip, TLG!

3	Parts list The Pieces: Pretty standard stuff here and as I mentioned, lots of 1x1 plates and tiles (at least 100.)

3	However, we do get quite a few windows and a couple of doors.

3	A majority of the color is black and yellow.

3	I did see a few pieces that I was not familiar with so I?m going to show them below.

3	Keep in mind I?m not a parts jockey so bear with me if I think a part is brand new for 2008 and it was actually released with the classic space line.

3	2x2 Window (fixed) and 4x3 window that opens: The follow photo shows the window glass (same as in Corner Caf?

3	), door glass and new black parts.

3	Turns out these black parts are used as wheels.

3	I showed the window glass because it still contains the molding circle just like they did before.

3	It is hard to see from the photo, but it is there.

3	The door glass I think might be new: I don?t recall seeing these 2x2 round plates with clips before and I thought I would show the mail only because it is printed and not a sticker: I know these are common, but didn?t they have four studs on top?

3	These only have two: How about this sloped 4x3 window that opens: Overall a nice assortment of parts with nothing juniorized.

3	The Build: The build was fun and was fairly straightforward.

3	Once you figure out which of the three models to build, it goes pretty quick.

3	Here are a few shots: See how the inside is made: Look at the detail with the flowers and even the outside water faucet!

3	Outdoor seating area: Upstairs being built: Upstairs with opening roof (notice the satellite TV dish): Check out the patio on the upstairs complete with outdoor light and rain gutters!

3	Here?s my favorite, the BBQ grill.

3	At least we know where those new parts go: Finally, check out the tree.

3	No juniorization here!

3	Here is what is left over: So far, I have only built the primary model.

3	The others look interesting, especially the caf?.

3	The Design: The design was well done.

3	Very rich in detail.

3	I love how there are no juniorized parts.

3	The house is accessible by taking off the top floor (like Caf?

3	Corner and Market Street).

3	There is an internal staircase as well.

3	There is no interior to speak of in the beach house, but there is in the other two models.

3	The only real negative is that it is kind of small when you get it done.

3	It would be nice if it was about 50% bigger.

3	Here are a few views of the beach house with a few minifigs thrown in: Check out the close-up of the caf?

3	which I think looks great: Also, here is a photo of the interior of the apartment building where you can see the office and computer: Overall Thoughts: It is a really nice set.

3	A tad on the small side but it has some great detail and lots of features.

3	Quick enough to build all three models and would fit real nice into an existing town plan.

3	Is minifig scale, but does not come with any.

3	Lots of window parts and black slopes.

3	Is a nice diversion from the onslaught of Clone Wars ships that we can?t remember seeing from the movies.

3	Final Rating: 84% Build 9/10 (Pretty quick and fun.)

3	Functionality 9/10 (It is a Creator set so you have multiple varied builds.

3	Diverse enough to keep the kids entertained.)

3	Design 10/10 (Excellent and well thought out.

3	Outstanding detail for such a small model.)

3	Parts 6/10 (Fair, nothing earth-shattering but lots of slopes and windows.)

3	Price 8/10 (Price ratio is good but you get a lot of little parts.

3	Would be better with minifigs.)

3	Nice set and review.

3	What I really like is that this set gives You a lot of ideas for Your own houses (MOCs)?

3	KimT

3	Thanks for that really nice review Dunamis!

3	Now it is even more harder for me to wait for this set.

3	I hope my Legostore will get it tomorrow!!

3	It is really nice.

3	I?m a really big fan of the creator houses.. but that one is now the best one for me!!!

3	I love the colour of it and of course the windows at the roof.

3	*wub* Creator House ON!!!

3	Greetings Sandra

3	Love this set now more than ever.

3	*wub* I knew I wanted it from the first leaked boxshots, especially with my love of yellow buildings (just ask Hinckley ;-) ).

3	Great review, especially nice to see the closeup parts shots.

3	Those new 2x2 white windows are very much like replacements for the classic 2x2 windows TLG stopped regularly making a while back, so it's great to see them.

3	The wheels are trolley wheels, common in sets including stretchers and handcarts.

3	The holder for them is a fairly recent part I think.

3	I remember a couple coming in a little single minifig jet engine repair set I picked up in a S@H order within the last year.

3	Oh honey, be sure to wrench that chicken before it burns!

3	*wacko* Thanks for another excellent review of a set I'm even more excited about than before!

3	*y*

3	Thanks for the review!

3	I definitely plan on getting this one.

3	Thanks again!

3	*sweet*

3	Thank you for the nice review with many pictures.

3	*y* :-D I already wanted this set, but the pictures make it I want even much/more.

2	I didn't know that the other models in this set came with interiors.

2	This changes everything!

2	AgentRick57, on Jan 7 2008, 09:49 PM, said: I didn't know that the other models in this set came with interiors.

2	This changes everything!

2	Keep in mind there is not a lot of interior, just mainly what was shown in the last two photos of the review.

2	Still, it does make the models really nice.

3	Great review, thank you.

3	I have this on order for my youngest's birthday next month as our first venture into Creator.

3	Looking towards the Town House thereafter, and then perhaps Town Plan or the Town House.

3	Another great review from Dunamis Thanks!

3	I will get it if I can find it on sale!

3	!

3	Thanks for the review.

3	*sweet* This set is on my when-I-see-it-I-buy list!

3	I'll buy this.

3	Thank you for the great review.

3	I think, I?ll get 2 of these sets, so I can have the Beach House and the Caf?

3	Thanks for this great review!

3	This is definitely a must-buy for me, just like the other creator houses.

3	Thanks for the great review!

3	Very in depth!

2	Hey, Yesterday I got around to MOD my beachhouse too!

2	I bought two boxes so I could have enough material for an extra floor and then I also added a kitchen, a vine in the backyard, storage for the upper floor...

2	Try to spot the humongous flatscreen TV!

3	Thanks for the great review!

3	Hehe, enjoy it very much.

3	My fave part was the BBQ pit :-$

3	I have been debating on whether or not to buy it-It would appear you made up my mind for me!

Edited by Darth_Legois_619, 23 March 2008 - 11:00 PM.

3	Thanks for the review Dunamis, this is a great little set!

3	I'm also very impressed with Takuto20's mods.

3	I've been trying a few of my own.

3	I liked the tower block design, but a lot of stuff needed fixing.

3	Firstly I added a 4th wall, and made it so the storeys could be lifted off like in the other models.

3	I also added flowers on the windowsills and doorways out on to the balconies.

3	Still to be added is an extra door for the top floor which I'm going to get from the new doors and windows pack.

3	I added a chimney that goes all the way up the back of the house, and has a fireplace on every level.

3	Each floor is fully furnished with a fireplace, wash basin and bed on the upper levels... ...and a corner sofa and coffee table, plus an extra large fireplace on the ground floor.

3	Finally here is my idea of what to do with two copies of this set!

3	All the parts pictured are from 2x 4996, except 5 extra fence panels and the minifigs.

3	The house on the left has it's garden at the rear.

1	1.

1	BEFORE BUYING Even if I am City fan, those new sized planes are really not mine cup of tea, my love to Lego is firmly frozen somewhere between years 1980-1995.

1	Main reason to buy was, that I wanted to write a review at Czech Afol web Kostky.org.

1	I bought it three days ago via web advertising, price was +- 35 USD.

1	2.

1	AFTER OPENING THE BOX As presumed, some very big parts and three bags, and as an additional bonus lot of Danish air free of charge.

1	First sight told me, that this will be really short and easy building.. 3.

1	IMPRESSIONS DURING BUILDING ...and it was really true.

1	30 minutes of lazy building.

1	Bag 1 - plane.

1	Bag 2 - plane gondols with supports.

1	Bag 3 - wings and propellers.

1	When I saw the way, how is this plane made, I was strongly thinking to play Money for Nothing from Dire Straits as a music accordant with whole set.

1	4.

1	IMPRESSIONS AFTER BUILDING - LOOKOUT Juniorized creeps.

1	This is my first plane in this scale and for 99% the last one.

1	Lack of details, lot of ugly big parts, from whole set you can see the main development target - to keep RRP at some certain low level.

1	Inner space of airplane absolutely undone, no details, no luggage, no computers, nothing at all!!

1	Just a lot, lot of air!

1	The very only details in whole plane are the stickered pilots desk and some kind of seat constuction.

1	5.

1	IMPRESSIONS AFTER BUILDING - PLAYABILITY But, what is playability at this set?

1	Hydroplane, which cannot float (as seen on enclosed photos) ?

1	If TLC will make some new kind of big parts used for gondolas, to make the plane floating, they will for sure make no other damage.

1	Juniorization couldn?t be higher.

1	You even cannot drive across the carpet with the plane.

1	So, how to play?

1	Open the doors, open the cabin part, and turn with propellers?

1	Weak, Weak, Weak!

1	6.

1	RESUMED IMPRESSIONS Sadly I must say, that at limited release sets TLC?

1	boat seems to sailing to the worst part of the coast.

1	After quite good 7344, perfect 7899 and 7900, strange, but acceptable 7998, juniorization came back with 7906, followed with this ugly Playmobilized 7732.

1	7.

1	FINAL WORD In fact, even 15 USD seems to be too much for this kind of set.

1	35 USD, expected RRP in our country, is really overpriced to hell.

1	Neither set, nor minifig is not interesting.

1	TLC maybe knows about juniorization as well, as nowhere on the box the number of pieces isn?t written.

1	If you my AFOL friends want to spent your bucks, better give half of the price to African orphans.

1	You will save your money, and you will have a good feeling!

1	Ah great review Kanal-K1 (and welcome to EB!

1	:-D ), I was waiting for one of this set.

1	Not that I was expecting anything good, I won't buy it.

1	I agree with thr playability, it does seem weak.

1	What can you do with it.

1	Swoosh it?

1	:-/ Big step backwards LEGO... :-( Dr.

1	Brick

1	I think this is one to leave on the shelf with the giant dump truck of 2006 and the hovercraft of 2007!

1	A big thumbs down for me.

1	This doesn't look like Lego at all :-| *n* *n* *n* *n* *n* out of *n* *n* *n* *n* *n*

1	Howly cow!

1	This is *y* *y* *y* for you for making a review so fast!

1	Thank you so much.

1	Hope it keeps a lot of people from buying.

1	:-D , great comment!

1	This will never be my first or last plane and that for 100% :-X 7723 Crap plane OFF!

1	Review gets *y* *y* , ugly plane gets :-X.

1	Thanks for the review!

1	Thanks for the review, but Its an utter pass for me on this one - I already have a huge juniorized plane from the airport set - one is enough for me!

1	:-$

1	I have the big passenger plane so I'll be passing on this one.

1	One big juniorised plane is enough for me!

1	If I didn't have the passenger plane though I'd rather get the Cargo plane.

1	There's enough Police in my city as it is!

2	Am I the only that one that thinks it is not SO BAD??????????????????????

2	?What I am trying to say is wouldn't planes be this big in real life??

2	?I know it has a lot of big pieces but how would they make them any smaller,or how would they the big pieces into a bunch of tiny pieces?well any way I do think in some cases that if there is any "juniorized" involved it should be with duplo.

2	complaning OFF

1	Thanks for the review!

1	*sweet* I am stunned at the lack of an interior... not that it makes much difference as I wasn't likely to want this set anyway as I own the passenger plane from last year.

1	Sorry to steal your image, but I just had to post this!

1	:-P

2	Thks for this caustic review :-D I'll wait for the parts on bricklink.

2	I think you're a bit unfair with this small oversized submarine - oups sorry, I mean plane.

2	Here are some advantages I tried to imagine : 1. that's the first submarine with a plane nose, 2.

2	That's the first unprinted nose, 3.

2	That's the first shark that make me laugh, and which has a plain white fin 4.

2	And at last, you should have notice that that the first submarine with a wing made of several plates It is said that this set has more than 200 parts...

2	Hide and seek !

2	X-D You may have lost several bags I'm eager that people buy this set a lot : I'd like to buy a lot of these new white 4x4x2 curved slope for my MOCs.

2	Can you take a picture of the plane crashing in the sink ?

2	Is it fire proof ?

2	I think that will be too easy this year to decide what is the crap of year ...

1	Just pull the plug out of your bathtub.

1	But wait... it won't fit through the drain because it's too big :-( Come on, they could have at least put one tiny little seat inside that horrible fuselage!

1	:-X :-X

1	Thanks for the review, unfortunately the pictures did not load for me!

1	I have to say having seen other images, I do agree with your comments, the plane is far to big, and not enough details.

1	That sums it up for me!

1	:-D :-D :-D Concerning last sentence - I have seen or built hundreds of different sets issued since 1980 until now, but this plane is really a hot candidate not only for Crap of the year, but for Crap of the decade... Last two days I thought about the sense of this set, and, finally, I was enlighted - I must call to my folks living in a small village, I am pretty sure, that they will be happy for a new house for their pullets.

1	Edited by Kanal-K1, 17 January 2008 - 06:31 PM.

1	i have to agree with almost all of the replies here that This set is the most ugliest looking Lego Set I have ever seen.

1	If I have never seen this set, and ppl showed it to me, I would have thought it would be some little kid's MOC or something (no offence!)

1	Huge juniorized pieces, bad color theme (i would say it would look better if the wing is white), no interior and huge DSS!

1	I will avoid this set like the plague.

1	I own the entire CITY line (except for the airport) and planning to get all the CITY stuff that Lego releases.

1	But, this set will ruin my plans coz I will avoid it... unless someone gives it to me for free.

1	haha *wacko* Boo LEGO BOO!

1	:-X

1	:-D :-D Wonderful review, now I'll never even consider getting this set (not that I did before... X-D).

1	Thanks for your insight!

1	~Peace

1	I'll probably get the nice green Cargo plane.

1	But not this.

1	How can the same hull pieces be used for full size jets and what's supposed to be a small seaplane.

2	What I don't understand is what sort of crime this seaplane is exactly designed to fight that the multitude of other crimefighters in Lego City can't handle.

1	This still looks like a cool set but the price not so much.

1	Do all lego police set come with the polizei option or just ones from europe i have not bought a police set in years.

3	LEGOMAN132, on Sep 11 2008, 06:26 PM, said: This still looks like a cool set but the price not so much.

3	The price is now €20 in Ireland on S@H, which is reasonable considering the large fuselage pieces.

3	Has anyone modded this set to make a reasonable looking plane?

3	I am thinking of buy it to do so, but I don't want to take a risk and end up with lots of useless pieces.

3	Aswell as -€20.

3	Hello and welcome to another Redman set review!

3	Well, actually, the first Redman set review!

3	I'm your host, Redman, and today I adorn my medieval outfit to tell you about the Impulse set simply titled "The Knight".

3	This is a great set, with 14 pieces, 2 of which are spare, and a minifig with 2 weapons, 2 helmets, and some shiny armour.

3	All this is packaged in a tiny box, just short of 10 cm?

3	(or 3?

3	inches?

3	), with a neat little instruction manual that folds up to the size of the weapons rack included in the set.

3	As you can see, this set only costs a measly 7 NZD.

3	(Disclaimer: Redman not included.)

3	Here we see the box, clearly showing what the box holds.

3	On the top we see a 1:1 scale picture of a minifig, for those new to Lego, or who have forgotten how big a minifig is I guess.

3	:-/ X-D The instruction manual, showing the nice and easy built, with me for size comparison.

3	:-D (*Sorry about the dark image, I had to lean over the light to get a birds eye pic.

3	;-)*) Here we see the 2 different soldiers you can make with the set; a knight, and a guard or standard troop or soldier or whatever you want to call him... (Note, each set comes with only 1 minifigure, and additional accessories.)

3	Of course you know I'm in the picture just for the sake of it, I'm not really one of the soldiers.

3	X-D The neat little weapons rack, or rather equipment rack, as it holds not only a weapon but a shield (except the ovoid ones), helmet, and armour.

3	Nice and easy storage, so your equipment won't get dirty lying around on the ground.

3	:-D One of the spare parts is another of those robot hands, so you can stick that in place of the shield and allow the rack to hold 2 weapons.

3	Just thought you'd like to know that.

3	:-$ And here we see the nifty little structure of the thing.

3	It can even support a whole minifig!

3	Note the grey stud on the bottom bar is a spare part, I just find it better used there to hold the armour.

3	:-) Huh?

3	I don't remember this picture... 8-| It appears I drifted off, and these guys don't look too happy I overtook their weapons equipment rack.

3	:-$ I should go... X-D So, in conclusion this is a great set for army building, at a reasonable price, with nice equipment, and it can be picked up as a little extra with your normal shopping.

3	X-D That's all for today folks!

3	*sweet* [/Redman] So, what do you think?

3	Should I continue with these Redman Reviews ?

3	(:-P), or just stop now?

3	X-D Comments and criticism welcome!

3	:-$ ~Peace

3	An excellent first time (?)

3	review iamded!

3	*y* Well, atleast a first time Redman review anyway.

3	I really enjoy Redman, I hope to see him pop up more often.

3	Your pics are great now that you ditched the phone :-P , and you've shown the set from many different angles and perspectives.

3	Thanks for this brilliant review, you have certainly convinced me to get a few of these, and then some X-D Redman ON!

3	EDIT: BTW, is it just me, or does my new avatar make me seem a bit creepy?

3	8-| Batbrick is Back!

3	Wish I could find some of these sets locally, but so far no luck.

3	:'-( I fully intend to steal your use of a character to do the reviewing, should I ever do one like this.

3	Anyway, great review, I think I will get 5 of these X-D Batbrick Away!

3	>:-)

2	very good reviews, i think that redman is really ok, a very little cute curious fig... sadly he is not in the impulse set... ;-) I wish to see redman still around about your creepy avatar, yes, it look a bit creepy *skull* nausicaakro (this impulse set is storage in 8 copies, with 8 wizard set, 16 city set (2x), 16 mission to mars set... so if you want buy 10 of this (like me) you must find 2 different toy center)

3	You should continue with these Redman Reviews There great!!

3	!

3	Nice review, very detailed.

3	*y* As for the spare parts, mine didn't come with any.

3	Both dark grey 1x1 round plates are used on the weapons rack (one for the armour, one for the helmet) and I only got one robot hand for holding weapons.

3	Thanks everyone for your positive feedback, it's really appreciated!

3	:-D You'd be surprised how long that 'Redman Presents' thing up the top took me to make!

3	X-D So, it appears people do like Redman, expect him to be reviewing The Good Wizard and Battle Arachnoid in near future!

3	(I know those have already been reviewed, but New Zealand never gets sets first, so I'll just be reviewing the sets I get.

3	:-D ~Peace

3	I like Redman, he'd make a good superhero.

3	Good review!

3	Edit: 200 posts!

3	Edited by AgentRick57, 19 January 2008 - 05:58 AM.

3	Thanks, AgentRick!

3	Actually Redman's based on the wrestling costume version of Spider-man, as seen in this set.

3	*sweet* ~Peace

1	I would have purchased a few of these except for the fact that I do not like the new torso that they use.

3	Well today i finally got my hands on set 7038, now since the moment i first saw pics of this set i knew it was for me.

3	So lets start with the new troll helmet and torso, these are both great.

3	This troll really stands out as a leader when next to the usual trolls in the dwarf mining set: Ok so here's a few shots of the front of the set: Now one thing i really like about this set is the way that lego have placed the back wheels higher than the front.

3	This allows the set to really appear to being pulled: Here we have a shot at the missiles on the wagon, these are better than some around i have to say.

3	If you look just behind the bottom missile you will see a simple firing device, simply push it down and then let it go to see those missiles fire: The troll flag is moved behind the missiles for firing: One thing that does bother me about this set is the lack of anything on the rear, ok it's easy to fix with a little moc'ing so it's not the end of the world but i would of liked something placed there: Now lets move on to the Crownie's wagon, this is simple yet good for holding weapons: As for the Crown knights themselves, well there the ones from the impulse sets which is great IMO: Here's a few quick shots of the 2 larger trolls we have so far, i prefer the sand green one.

3	What about you?

3	Well that's the end for now, requests for pics and comments are welcome.

3	Overall i rate this set as a must for anyone who's a fantasy castle fan, i know i'll be getting more of this set...... As for the new wagon well it's joined up with the other trolls: I do hope the impules crownies i bought today can handle them, oh and yes i did change the knights heads X-D : Fantasy war on!!

3	*vader*

3	Awesome review!!

3	I like the turkey leg hanging in front of the troll X-D Yea the back looks a little....Empty 8-| Well Overall I enjoyed the review!

3	See ya soon!

2	seems like a good set should i get it?

2	BTW how did you get you hands on this?

2	Commander Andrew of 501 st, on Jan 19 2008, 12:51 AM, said: seems like a good set should i get it?

2	BTW how did you get you hands on this?

2	Well if you like the Fantasy line then yes, if not no.

2	I had to get this set through Shop @ Home, took ages to get here i'm sorry to say.

3	Looks like an ace set :-$ I may get this just for the sand green troll, even if I'm not a great castle fan, I do want one of them things!

3	*wub* I also love the goblin's new metal flaked helmet, and the same style with the wheels.

3	They look very nice.

3	The chicken leg fishing pole is always fun too :-$

3	Nice review.

3	*sweet* This is a must buy for me since I *wub* the new sand green giant troll!

3	Now I just have to wait until it's available in the US :'-( General Tarful

3	Thanks for this excellent review Vader!

3	It seems you are succumbing to the Castle side of the force.

3	I love the new helmet, and the new Orc torso is fantastic as well, which is great to see that the Troll Faction has many ranks too.

3	The Troll himself I love, I agree with you in saying I prefer the sand green version.

3	The battle wagon is cool, one of the better wagon designs, and the flag is a great touch which improves it.

3	Sadly the back is rather empty, but a few mods'll change that :-) And of course this set includes the infamous chicken pole!

3	One pic request, if you have time Vader, could you please post a few pics of the new helmet on its own, and on a human soldier please?

3	Batbrick is Back!

3	>:-)

3	Thanks for the review *vader*!

3	The first picture of the troll is great, the gold armour really shines!

3	X-D A fantastic set, I'll definitely get a couple of these!

3	*wub* As for the Ogres/'giant trolls', the dark tan one fits in the mine setting well, but for above ground, settings, I prefer the sand green one.

3	*y* ~Peace Edited by iamded, 19 January 2008 - 10:21 AM.

2	>:-) Yeah it's alot better than the other one, i'll have to buy some extra ones now just to replace the old ones |-/ Still let's hope the new impulse set has the new version *y*

3	This is fantastic, I love the new helmets for the goblins *sweet* I've always loved the chicken leg thing, really screams LEGO to me!

3	At least how LEGO used to be :'-( Great little bit The goblins are awesome too, and the sand green one should look good next to the tan ones...gives a nice feeling of a real species.

3	In reality not all members of a species are identical, it's great seeing them in different colors.

3	Great review X-D

3	Those extra helmet pictures just seal how much I love those new helmets *wub* They look so great.

3	Thank you for the review, vader!

3	That set looks worth buying!

3	8-?

3	i think you gave me a good reason to buy it... ;-)

1	Great review, Vader :-) As I've said before, this is a nice set, but doesn't really come with anything that doesn't come with the other sets of the line.

1	For this reason, it will be somewhere at the bottom of my list for 2008.

1	Also, I like torso and helmet of the Dwarf Mining orcs much better.

1	The colours make the torso look rather dull and boring, while the other, more brown one, looks much clearer and more exciting.

1	I think I like the *knight* helmet better too, looks more covering and threatening than this one, although I'll save my judgement until I have one in my hands.

1	Thanks again Vader ;-) EDIT: Forgot to mention, hilarious pic in your sig, Vader :-D Edited by TinyPiesRUs, 19 January 2008 - 08:28 AM.

3	Thanks for the review!

3	i love this set!

3	it's a cheap way to get green trolls, and i love the new helmet, it looks great and I think it will be very usefull for other factions as well.

3	*sweet* DNL

1	A Troll driven by a turkey leg, what a wonderful little detail!!!

1	:-D :-D Thanks for the review Vader.

1	Very clever, using a flag to hide that crazy firing device.

1	I find it rather odd they used blue pins for this.

1	Black or gray would've been alot more discrete.

1	About the big trolls, I think using different colours is good.

1	I don't think a troll force would be very organized, so different colours would make the effect complete *y* .

1	As for your troops, looks quite fearsome!

1	Definitely compared to my pathetic number of soldiers.. :-$ A nice set, but I would rather get the Attack on Tower though.. no matter about the price difference.

3	Especially since the Orcs are sand green as well, indicating some relation between the two races (if they are indeed separate races).

3	Great review, very detailed and with lots of pictures.

3	I was already interested in this set, but after reading your review I want this set for sure!

3	Tks for the review mate ;-) Now I have to bloody wait long because Lego France has this line available in freaking march >:-( Pissed *yoda* On !!

3	:-D I love the "new" goblin :-P That helmet is really cool.

3	Why on Earth TLC didn't include that one in the dwarf mine ?

3	Such another idiotic move |-/ Anyone keeping track of TLC's stupidity lately ?

3	That would be interesting !!

3	I clearly want a huge goblin army now hehe !!

3	And I totally agree with you mate, the troll lokks better in sand green.

3	The cart itself is pretty lame IMO - just a sordid excuse to include yet another annoying shooting crappy device.

2	After getting this new helmet i really wish lego had included it with the mining set, it's bloody annoying having to buy yet more of them from BL :'-( The shooting bit is better than some sets that have had one, at least this one is smartly done and of course it can also be hidden.

2	Thanks for the review of a set I would otherwise probably have passed on.

2	Out of curiosity how did you 'know it was for you'?

2	You seem to be building quite a collection.

2	Why castle now?

2	Was the fantasy element all it took?

2	Just curious.

2	Thanks again and God Bless, Nathan

3	Lego City Truck & Forklift Set # 7733 Pieces: 343 Price: $24.99 (USD) Store of Purchase: Toys R'Us Release Date: January 2008 After discussion of the mysterious yellow cargo contained in this new City transport set and a visit to my local TRU, I purchased this set.

3	I was immediately pleased with the price/piece which I think is pretty reasonable (343 pieces for $25).

3	Starting with the box, great City artwork boasting "Special Edition": Tha backside of the box (no alternate models comes as no surprise): The dreaded decals (I was looking for the skull and bones for radioactive, but no such luck): My favorite part of the set, a very clever forklift: Side view: And the backside: What I like about the forklift is the bars across the top giving the vehicle a "real-life" design.

3	The double wheels in the front with two pieces that can hold the wheels also adds to a clever design: I like the figs (although not much new - perhaps I'll make the driver into a werewolf later): The set includes three cargo pallets, the first some sort of fuel with gauge: The 2nd, two Indy containers, and a square 2x4 brick (I have not put the decals on yet): And the mysterious yellow cargo.

3	Your guess is as good as mine :-$ .

3	On to the truck, the front section: The front grill: Another angle: The back: I like the opening mechanism that is very simple, but works well.

3	Also is the large plate tile piece inside.

3	I like this because the entire interior has no studs: And the trailer section of the truck: Orange and yellow tail lights: And the rear trailer open: The complete set: Summary: This is a neat set that reminds me a bit of classic Lego City (but larger).

3	It is very playable and has a lot of accessories adding to the value.

3	The build was very simple, and enjoyable (took me about an hour).

3	It is a great addition to a number of City sets including the Cargo Ship, Container Stacker, the World City Cargo Train, and the new Cargo Plane.

3	As I mentioned previously, I have not yet put on the decals that I'm sure will really add to the overall look of the set.

3	The forklift is awesome and I like the cargo containers.

3	The truck could have benefited from a few additional details (chrome smokers, and an undercarriage box that really opens).

3	Considering everything, I would buy this set again.

3	Hope you enjoy and perhaps this mysterious cargo will make its way into a Brickster Mystery.

3	*y*

2	question: what's different with this "special edition"?

2	btw, nice shots!

3	The forklift is amazing, and nice design of the opening side doors aswell.

3	Thanks for the review, I may actually pick this one up ;-)

2	Im guessing the main difference is the fact that the box says special edition.

2	General Kannon, on Jan 19 2008, 05:10 AM, said: Im guessing the main difference is the fact that the box says special edition.

2	It's either that or it's a ToysRUs exclusive set, as my Armoured Drilling Unit box also had special edition on it.

2	Brickmaster, on Jan 19 2008, 12:27 AM, said: It's either that or it's a ToysRUs exclusive set, as my Armoured Drilling Unit box also had special edition on it.

2	Special Edition mean that it's a store exclusive set.

2	the cargo theme is a TRU exclusive, and another example is thr tie crawler is exclusive to Target.

2	also, can th doors be opened on either side?

3	Thanks for the review!

3	That forklift is wonderful!

3	*wub* I may have to pick this one up convince dragonator to pick this one up!

3	:-D Too bad it can only hold 1 crate.

3	:-/ ~Peace

2	AgentRick57, on Jan 18 2008, 09:48 PM, said: can th doors be opened on either side?

2	No, just one side.

2	I'm not sure why the "Special Edition".

2	It appears to be the same set as Lego SAH?

3	Wow, 8-?

3	great review.

3	*y* I usually don't buy City sets but I think I might get this one just for that awsome forklift!

3	*wub* General Tarful

2	I'm curious, for those of you who are not into City sets and want this set for the forklift, what would you use it for?

2	,

2	Mr Tiber, on Jan 19 2008, 10:26 AM, said: Hmmm, put it in my pirate port and use it to carry rum!

2	Perhaps that's the mysterious cargo.

2	Mr. Tiber replaced the petro with rum... :-D

1	Thank you very much for your nice review, The Brickster!

1	*y* Although I really like this set I?m sooo disappointed about the big "on the cabin" brick :-X , that I probably won?t buy it.

1	TLC could easiliy have done so much better with bricks already in use, like these: or or No, that juniorized part is a thorn in my side.

1	>:-( But I have use for those new canisters.

2	It's really not bad.

2	It is big, but not a show stopper for me.

2	Thanks for the review.

2	I think the special edition is just for making people intrested and make them want to buy that set or something.

2	Some guy, on Jan 19 2008, 11:17 PM, said: I think the special edition is just for making people intrested and make them want to buy that set or something.

2	Hmm, that's a thought, but why would they pick this particular set?

2	I would expect they'd do that with a slightly bigger set, like the heavy hauler perhaps.

2	Why do you think they'de pick this one?

2	Why do you think they'de pick this one?

2	Good question.

2	Maybe it's merely a gimick to help push the city sets with all the other competing themes.

2	The cement mixer is a special edition as well.

3	this set looks pretty good to me, It is six wide isn't it?

3	That is nice for a truck like this

1	highlandcattle, on Jan 20 2008, 09:15 AM, said: this set looks pretty good to me, It is six wide isn't it?

1	That is nice for a truck like this Yes, 6-wide.

1	The only problem with these big trucks is how they look on the city roadplates (I've always thought too big), compared to Classic City trucks.

1	Getting off topic, I'd like to see Lego make a car transport truck.

1	I don't think I've ever seen one in Lego.

1	It would definately have to be 6-wide, or even larger.

1	Great review!

1	My only grip with this set is you can only fit one pallet in the truck.

1	It should have been the same size as the trailer so you can at least fit 2 pallets.

1	Seems like alotof wasted space.

1	If i'm going to transport cargo, i want to use the maximum amount of space aviable!!

1	X-D

2	X-D That's a fair gripe.

2	Someone else mentioned it above as well.

2	I thought the same thing when I went to load it.

3	I got this set last week and just to add a few of my own points CONS: - The forklift spring feels a bit flimsy - I don't know how long it will last or how much stress it would take - and the end coil isn't really heavily secured to the lift mechanism.

3	Time will tell on that one.

3	- 30 stickers!

3	It's the Exo-Force of City sets!

3	The truck set does look less plain with them on though.

3	I would reccomend lining them up with the green brick in the second container rather than applying the first lot without a guide or they may end up uneven - It's very hard to put the minifig in the forklift without dismantling (or breaking open) the set slightly - The cargo box attached to the main cabin of the truck doesn't hold very strongly - Minifigs are dull - that dark blue torso with pattern is way overused - green stickers are a different green to the bricks themselves PROS: - lots of nice pieces including the large white panels and cargo pieces, and i like the green/ white colour scheme - the cargo doors open well and the hingeing mechanism doesn't stand out to the detriment of the rest of the set (as some people have complained about the mail airplane) - studless floor in cargo containers makes it easy to move pallets in and out - fits in better than the Heavy Hauler to a minifig sized city - new 1x1x4 slope!

3	(at least I hadn't seen it before) OVERALL - nice set with some good pictures, although a bit flimsy, and way too many stickers - the same issues I have with the Cargo Plane as well (although that had more colour issues).

2	hey, thanks for the review The Brickster!

2	i was just wondering if you could possibly upload a picture of the instructions for the forklift, and, if possible, tell me the piece # of the 1x4 slope bricks (to bricklink them).

2	thanks!

2	I don't have a scanner for the instructions, but the 1x4 slope is listed as piece #4515362 in the instructions.

2	thats fine, as its not a neccesity.

3	Greetings, and welcome to another Redman Review!

3	I'm your host, Redman, and today I adorn my medieval outfit to tell you about the Impulse set simply titled "The Knight".

3	No wait, that's the old script.

3	X-D I mean, "The Good Wizard".

3	*sweet* The other Castle Impulse set (the first being 'The Knight'), this is a wonderful, and in my case unexpected addition to the Castle line!

3	I did not expect to get a nice good wizard, but rather another plain white skellie for the Impulse, and was pleasantly surprised when I saw the first picture of this set.

3	The Impulse sets give you pieces you wouldn't expect to see in such small sets, for example, The Knight came with the armour, and this comes with an owl, a gem, and a crystal ball piece.

3	It comes with 11 pieces, including the wand, owl, and gem, and no spares, which doesn't really matter as it doesn't need any.

3	The box sports the set number, age range (which I blissfully ignore X-D), awesome Castle logo, and the assembled set, with the usual 1:1 scale picture of a minifig.

3	The back of the box shows pictures of the boxed Skeleton Tower and King's Castle Siege sets.

3	Note the price is in New Zealand dollars, and is really the same prica as any other Impulse set.

3	Next are the instructions, which are separated into 3 parts, 1 for the minifigure, 1 for the table, and one for the bird stand.

3	Very simple, also worth mentioning is the parts numbers are next to their respective parts, for replacement parts etc.

3	On the back we see (on the top half) pictures of Skeleton Prison Carriage, Skeleton Tower, and King's Castle Siege, this time not of the boxed sets, but the sets themselves.

3	On the lower half we have 8 pictures, each of the different Impulse sets.

3	The Wizard's torso is plain sand blue, with no patterns or anything, but it doesn't really matter is his beard's in the way.

3	;-) The head is that same old 'white fade to grey beard' head, but the white beard covers up most of the grey.

3	My favourite part is the pants, I love that we're getting printed belts and legs again.

3	His belt has 4 gold crosses (as seen in, if you look closely, the new Crownie's torso and the Crownie archer's torso) and a belt buckle, and the legs have a bottle, a coin, and a small bag.

3	Nice little wizard-ey items.

3	The, er, items, no, accessories, no, models?

3	The stuff in the set include a little stand for the owl, and a table utilising the new 4x4 round piece in light bley, with the crystal ball in the middle, encasing the yellow gem held on by a 2x2 circle piece in blue.

3	Why blue, I'm not sure.

3	Maybe it's because the crystal is yellow, and the Crownie's colours are blue and gold, so the blue piece with the yellow crystal symbolise the Crownie's colours.

3	Or maybe TLC just felt the need to include an odd colour.

3	:-P In conclusion, this is a wonderful set, with some neat accessories, and it doesn't really need to be bought in the masses, after all, you needs an army of owls and wizards?

3	:-| :-P So it works fine as a single set, and adds a more fantasy feel to your Crownie army.

3	That's all for today folks!

3	*sweet* [/Redman] Thanks for reading another of my Redman interviews, any suggestions on how to/what to do to improve it is greatly appreciated, as are all comments and criticisms (except those blatant thoughtless criticisms that don't help at all :-P)!

3	Another Redman review!

3	You are an excellent reviewer iamded Redman, your pictures show all the details included in the set and your thoughts bring new light to features and bits I hadn't noticed or thought about before *y* I love this little set, I will get two I reckon, because I want all the Wizard bits in a minifig box as well.

3	Nice little humorous pic at the end too.

3	One improvement I think could be to include the pics of the back of the box and other side of the instructions anyway.

3	Honestly, there isn't much to improve, you are an excellent reviewer :-) Redman ON!

2	:-D I sometimes flick from the minifig view of things to a person's view of things, but no one seems to notice, so it's okay.

2	X-D And I didn't include pics of the back of the instructions and box because they were included in some one else's Knight review, and there's no change.

2	But I will include them in future, in case someone hasn't seen any of the other reviews of the set I'm reviewing.

2	X-D Expect to see a review of Arachnoid Stalker (or Battle Arachnoid) in the near future!

2	~Peace

3	Nice review, your camera is much better now.

3	I look forward to more of your reviews :-) I just went to Toyworld today and got a wizard and 4 knights :-) And on top of that, they were having a 20% off sale *sweet* I might go back and get some more tommorrow.

3	The wizard is pretty good, and comes with some good parts (owl, beard, legs, hat, round table, crystal ball..).

3	It would be nicer if he had a torso with printing on it, but I can understand why they didn't.

2	The guy at the Martin's Toyworld here in Rotorua is quite professional, too much so for a toy shop.

3	I think the "coin" is actually some kind of amulet or locket.

3	Nice review, keep them coming!

3	*sweet*

3	Thanks for the review of this nice little set.

3	For it's price (3 euros here in Holland) it contains quite a lot of useful parts.

2	The only thing that could have been better in my opinion is the wand, I always liked this one: I miss those wands!

2	They could've used it, but I think the wood wand kindda adds "realis" to the set, and since many fans don't like their castle theme to be too fantasized, I guess Lego decided to use a mold that was still being used for various sets.

2	When I get this set I'm going to put it on the Tower in the King's castle, you know, the one that is right above the throne room?

2	;-) That'll be a great spot, and then I'll finally have all the necessary characters, the King in his throne, the knights on the walls, the wizard on his tower top, and the Princess in her tower room that floats in mid air and is connected to the throne room by a 2-stud wide bridge!

2	Not bad.

2	I could see picking up a couple of these guys along with a few of the new knights.

3	Well, since no-one seems to have done one for this set, here we go....

3	Here's the complete set in all its glory.

3	Yes, I really like it, but then, Tabletown has the capacity to support it and my green Army have their eyes on it as a potential military transport as well.

3	:-) I'll start out with the little airport ground car thingy - very neat and functional, here are views front and back: Next up, the steps which allow the plane crew to embark and disembark: And to round off this little trio, the cargo loading platform, here in its lowered position.

3	Note the prong thingy sticking out from the rear: And here raised.

3	The prong thingy is now hinged up to support the back of the platform and keep it level: Here's a slightly different angle so you can see the pieces under there: The all-important cargo itself!

3	Hmmm...not much for a plane this size...

3	The cargo pallet slots neatly onto the loading platform: Here's the complete set of ground equipment - all attached: And so onto the plane itself.

3	Note that unlike the other large planes, the main wing sits at the TOP of the row of bricks making up the side of the fuselage: I took it apart a little so you can see the internal construction of the fuselage.

3	Note that the cargo area is really small, right at the back.

3	What else is this thing carrying?

3	Illegal immigrants?

3	:-) A picture of the rear of the fuselage, just because I like the sticker: Front landing gear.

3	WAY better than on the other large planes.

3	I don't know if this is a new piece or what but I've had no problems with it at all, and my kids have been playing with it as well: The rather sexy rear undercarriage - this area reminds me of one of those giant Russian transport planes - wicked: Those angled grey slopes atop each side of the rear undercarriage annoy the heck out of me as they KEEP COMING OFF whenever I pick the plane up.

3	I think a 1x4 plate on top to bind them together might solve that.

3	A slightly blurry view (sorry) from underneath.

3	The gear LOOKS like it might be capable of retracting internally, but alas, no.

3	This is a shame as there's certainly enough room in there and it's a wasted opportunity IMO.

3	Might have to modify that... A view of one of the four engines, I personally think they look too small and should have something under the wing as well to make them rounder: Cockpit: Crew door, open.

3	I LOVE the smooth action of these doors and the way they seal flush against the fuselage when closed: Cargo door, open: Crew door with docked ladder: Cargo door with docked loading platform: Cargo slots inside and locks into place the same way it sits on the loader, neat: The minifigs, sorry this one is a bit blurry: And that concludes this week's "Show and Tell".

3	Dr. S.

3	sweet plane looks much better than in the catalogs *sweet*

3	Thanks Dr.S for this great review, this is your what, second one?

3	Anyway, this aint half bad, I actually kind of like the bigger planes despite the annoying big pieces, and this one looks to be the best yet.

3	Batbrick Away!

3	>:-)

3	I do admit the amount of cargo is rediculously small, but It still looks good.

3	Say, how much can the plane hold?

3	Thanks for the review!

3	*sweet*

2	Thanks for the review!

2	*sweet* That's all the space you get.

2	Now, it MIGHT be possible to rip out that rear bulkhead at the back of the wing and fill the middle area with tiles so cargo pallets could slide up the fuselage.

2	But that would definitely prevent the undercarriage folding internally if that's what you wanted to do as well.

2	Dr. S.

2	Thanks for the review and pics Dr S!

2	I am still considering this set.

2	What is the instruction manual number?

3	Dr. S. They are perfect!

3	*wub* Thanks very much.

3	*sweet* It's built very oddly.

3	*wacko*

2	Thank you very much for a good and informative review, Doc Sinister.

2	*y* This looks like the best of the BigPlanes to me, very nice and smoother than the rest.

2	:'-) Although, like you?ve said, what the heck?re they transporting, diamonds and pearls?

2	So much wasted space.... And the landing gear should really fold in.

2	*n*

1	I loved the pics in the catalogues but was a bit disappointed by the build and end result.

1	My own thoughts: CONs: - as noted, the cargo space is really small considering the size of the plane, although I can see this is restricted due to playability - without the barrier in the middle, the cargo would slide all over the place while the plane was being swooshed - the cargo 'lift' (I'm not sure how else to describe it) is very weak and snaps off, although it is a clever design I think it's badly implemented - there is nothing to hold the cargo pallet to the cargo lift truck so it tends to slide off all over the place as soon as the truck moves - colour issues - I had at least 3 shades of green with the larger plane pieces and noticeable variances even with identical cargo hatch pieces.

1	At least one of them also came quite scratched, which was a little disappointing - At $79.95 AUD it's $10 more than the Passenger Plane was with less pieces and figs, and no printed pieces whatsoever!

1	more $ for less, methinks.

1	PROs: - Lots of nice cargo crate pieces and even the stickers for these are pretty good.

1	- landing gear piece adjusts very well to height differentials so the plane doesn't lose its gear as often as the earlier passenger planes - the hinging mechanism works very well to open the cargo holds - opens very smoothly and is not noticeable - I'd definitely like to see more of this technique - the little vehicles work well chained together and are all good small designs OVERALL: - I really like the large planes since 06 but I don't think they've still quite hit the nail on the head.

1	Whereas the earlier planes were a little flimsy, this one is sturdier but has its own issues.

1	The look of the Cargo Plane is nice, and the new landing piece and cargo hatch pieces are really great, but some design weaknesses and colour issues detract from the overall product.

1	It's a shame as with a bit of tweaking this could have been a must-have set.

3	Wow, that's a great review of a great set Dr S!

3	*y* As you yourself have already noted, this has the potential to be a fantastic military MOC!

3	With a bit of modification you can get the engines to be rounder, or perhaps do away with them completely and replace them with jet engines.

3	*sweet* Though I can't think of a system to retract the undercarriage at the top of my head it seems like there's indeeed more than enough potential to do so.

3	It reminds me rather of an Ilyushin Il-76, one of my favourite cargo planes.

3	:'-)

3	Tks DrS for your cool review !!

3	I admit tht this plane is way better than I imagined ;-) Even if I still dislike the new hull, the engines and landing gear are really improved and the way to operate the crates work really well !!

3	Tks for sharing these pics ;-) *yoda*

3	I love the way they look, granted they go back to the 70's but so does the 747 or the C-130.

3	You can't argue about tastes and colours, I guess :-P Dr S - How much did the set cost?

3	Well, I can only speak for myself - I like it.

3	Worth ?35.00?

3	Well, it's a big box for that amount of money, but full of big parts of course.

3	I dunno - could do with being cheaper, but then I'm sure we all think that of our favourite hobby.

3	?30.00 would be nearer the mark IMO.

3	Dr. S.

1	Thanks for the review That seems to be a nice set but as far I'm concerned, I don't think it's worth EUR 49.99.

1	There aren't so many parts though those new curved slope will add some more building possibilities.

1	*y* What lacks : - A 2 x 4 cut out in the lower part of the nose to retract the landing gear.

1	- A 4 x 6 cut out in the lower part of the tail to allow passagers to get off through the back like in a DC-10 - some real plates and tiles instead of these crappy wings.

1	This part is the useless one that TLC ever produced *n*

2	The amount of cargo that huge plane carries!

2	8-?

2	green peace would have a field day!

2	X-D Nice review Dr S but this set is just too big for my town scale!

2	;-) Edited by casewindu, 05 February 2008 - 09:54 PM.

2	Nice review, Dr. S!

2	I have been thinking long and hard about the scale of the planes in my town.

2	I would like to keep my passenger planes in their classic 4-wide fuselage style, but I really don't mind the new plane hull pieces if they are used as an enormous transport plane like the Ilyushin-76.

2	Unfortunately I can't afford this lovely new green one at the moment (which would be perfect to go with my green army) as I took too much of a hit buying the new 2008 Star Wars sets!

2	But I have modified my white one to take huge cargo loads, in fact my APC is designed specifically to fit inside.

2	Unfortunately I'm a bit busy to take pics at the moment, but hope to put some up soon.

3	Dr. S: I was not planning on buying this set after my disappointment with the other large airplane, but after looking at this image review, I just might buy.

3	The green color is really the aspect that makes this airplane stand out.

3	I think it looks great!

3	Thanks for the review.

2	If i do end up geting this set it will be for my slowly growing army.

2	btw Nice review *y*

1	Thank for the review Doc!

1	The only thing I like in this set is the small car.

1	So I will not buy this set just for it!

1	I really dislike those new planes, toooo bbiiiigggg!

1	With this size, this cargo plane can carry just fiew things!

1	What a shame!

1	I think that the way TLC has made the wings is not very good... Like the rest of those big pieces... Just my thought.

1	The positif point of this it's that it makes me saved some money :-D

2	*cricket cricket* *cricket cricket*

3	An excellent review Dr. Sinister!

3	*y* I really like how TLC is using the new crate mold in different sets!

3	The transport car is really neat as well as the lifting thingy Plus I love the green color!

3	*wub* P

2	At my local Wal*Mart there was most of the 2008 sets including the Indiana Jones ones :'-) I picked up this one and the Motorcycle Chase!

2	Name: 7621 Lost Tomb Price: $20.00 Parts: 277 Figs: 3 *Box Art First off we have the great Indiana Jones Box art!!

2	I must say the designers did an excellent job on it!

2	I love the little temple design with skulls!

2	As well as including Indy in the right hand corner.

2	The back of the box is just as cool showing all the neat play features of the set as well as an advertisement for the Indiana Jones Game *Figs First off we have our hero, Indian............. What the hell?

2	Why is there a freaking CW Anakin head on Indy!!

2	There was a production slip up as instead of Indy's head I get Anakin's!

2	:-| |-/ I open the box up and there staring me in the face is his ugly face!!

2	TLC is defiantly doing to here a gnarly complaint from me!!

2	>:-( Ok now here we have the " real" Indy fig that is supposed to come with the set :-D I just noticed that his fedora hat goes down in the back!

2	Bonus Picture Time, Here is a jacketless Indy with his sleeve torn off, like he looks in the Temple of doom *sweet* The next figure up is our lovely Marion *wub* *wub* *wub* Plus her head is reversible with a scared face X-D Love the new hairpiece in black!!

2	Finally we have our undead skellie with second style head and poseable arms *The Well Of Souls The set itself is a nice model and playset!

2	The Anubis statues are very cool and I love all the hieroglyphs on the walls 8-?

2	Here is the SW link with Artoo and 3P0 X-D The Ark in its resting place The Ark removed, its very cool indeed, but TLC should have made the whole thing in chrome gold |-/ not metallic gold with brown and yellow!!

2	The closeup of the Anubis statue, Yes the Eye is a sticker but at leasts a gold color!

2	*Playability First off you can pull the pin on the Anubis statues which send them falling and taking out the walls.

2	Behind the wall a skellie swings out!

2	There is a lever in the back of the model where you push down and the snakes shower down upon the figs hehe With the snakes all around, Marion is both modeling with the new carrot torch and fending off viscous cobras :-D In the meantime Indy uses his whip to scale the wall and avoid all the snakes which he is afriad of.

2	In the meantime leaving Marion behind to fight them off.

2	:-P The whip is bendable but it will always snap back into a coil, its some type of bendy hard plastic *Scoring Figs- 9/10 Model- 8/10 Playability- 8.5/10 Overall Satisfaction- 4/10 (would be 9/10 if it wasn't for the stupid Anakin head error!)

2	In the end this is a charming set and could easily fit in with the adventurers!

2	It has the cool Anubis statues as well as the Ark.

2	Plus Indy, Marion and a skellie, great selection of figs but Sallah would have been better since he actually removes the ark with Indy However I am still wondering the point of the Anubis statues, this set does seem pretty silly :-P P

3	Thank you for this review!

3	it is a brilliant set!

3	i am definitely getting this set once Indy is released in New zealand hurry up TLC!

3	>:-( PS:could i have pic of what Indy looks like with an old classic whip?

1	Wow what a screw up from Lego!

1	That one is even more out there than the extra obi wan in the RC.

1	X-D

2	:-D Even so, you have to admit that it is good news for you; Lego will hapily give you the right head if you ask.

2	Thanks for the review.

2	I have this set too.

2	*wub*

3	Nice review, all the important stuff is there.

3	Weird cock-up by TLC to put an Ani face on Indy...

3	I didn't encounter any mistakes in my four Indy sets.

3	Great selfmade Temple of Doom Indy fig, Piranha!

3	So uhm... Has anyone found out yet what the extra hieroglyphic stickers are for?

2	I have noticed that at my local TLC store (Orlando) they have this set in a glass case on display...with the CW Anakin head on Indy.

2	I did not realize this was such I widespread problem.

2	Our set(really my 8-yr-old son's) came with the wrong head for Indiana Jones!

2	Thin eyebrows, no five o'clock shadow, lots of red scars...really hard for him to get into the character.

2	Everything else is great - especially the falling wall and snake trap!"

2	I might get this set today.

2	I hope I dont have this problem!

3	*y* A lovely playset, with a classical Egyptian adventurers touch.

3	Although I?m not completely sure for the robot arms for the statues....

3	Somehow, a little more details could?ve worked well for that set.... 8-|

2	Wow I can't believe other people have had this same head error mistake!

2	X-O I thought it was one of those extreme cases of production slip up!

2	The good thing is I will get a replacement Indy head, and get to keep that Anakin head!!

2	I forgot to mention that my set was also missing 1 black ear piece for the Anubis statues There also are extra stickers for my set, I can't figure out what they are for though?

2	hehe, I too like my TOD Indy fig 8-| :-D P

1	*sing* and i also got this set from cruddy wal mart

3	I got mine today!

3	X-D I too got an Anakin Clone Wars head, although I'm not really complaining since I already have an Indy head from the Motorcycle Chase set.

3	It is really odd that they would pack in such a different looking head though.

3	Also, for those that think the head has no use, try placing it under one of the braided new brown dwarf beards.

3	It looks pretty nice, I think!

3	*y* On the set, it's wonderful!

3	The hieroglyphic stickers are wonderful, Marion (especially her head and hair) is wonderful, and the Anubis statues are nice too.

3	There's also lots of nice tan parts, such as 20 round 2x2s, and 8 1x8 bricks.

3	All in all, it's a great set for the price, and I can't wait to get Race for the Stolen Treasure and Temple Escape now!

3	*sweet*

3	DAMMIT INDY, YOU WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO OPEN THE ARK!!!

3	i really like this set, i only brought it for Marion but its a nice set and fun to build.

2	I got this set and there weren't any qualms/misprints/mis packagings.

2	Hmmm, must be a small problem.

2	Yeah in mine I did not have any problems.

2	Well except on one of my dark blue round pieces it was a bit damaged but it still worked fine and I got a replacement from LEGO.

3	Welcome to: My sigfig Sgt.

3	Joey Sh.

3	will lead trough this review of the new City 7743 Police Surveilance Truck.

3	First of all the box: Front Back The Minifigs: 3 Police officers and a bad guy Now the vehicles: The cute little ATV *wub* The main part of the set: The Surveilance Truck A shot of the interior The trailer Back of the trailer The truck Back Side The little building: Front The interior And last but not least: Spare parts and not needed stickers That?s it!

3	Hope to see you again at the next episode of Sgt.

3	Joey?s Reviews.

2	Thanks for the review, Stealth Hunter.

2	*y* That truck looks better than I expected, and it?s for sure a pretty playable set.

2	Nice, but still too much police mayhem to me.

2	I think the new police station?ll satisfy all my safety needs.... :-)

2	Great review Stealth Hunter, a bit blurry in places but overall nice shots of the truck.

2	It is much, much better than I expected, but i still won't get it, I have no need for more police.

2	Thanks for the great review!

2	Batbrick Away!

2	>:-)

2	Thanks for the review, that truck is actually better than I first thought!

2	I am still tossing up getting it, as I am getting the Police Station, and where would it park?!

2	:-P I quite like the little building though, but still...

2	I am so confused *wacko*

2	I like the new station but the truck is a good question.

2	I still like the classic 1994 one and the 1980's can that was one of the first units I got

2	It looks to me that the little building is supposed to be like some sort of Customs checkpoint between one nation and another or like a toll facility on a highway.

2	I like the little checkpoint but I think that should be part of a separate set and 7743 just having the Police Mobile Command Center truck.

3	Hello and welcome to another, oh wait, first Batbrick and iamded review!

3	Today us two sworn enemies will be reviewing the Creator Cargo Chopper, here is the front of the box: And while pushing iamded to his doom, here is the back: Haha!

3	Ouch!

3	Oh dear...here are the parts anyway...

3	Here is the instruction of the first model, the Cargo Chopper.

3	I love Creator sets for the different models, they always excite me.

3	Just ignore me finishing off my nemesis in the background.

3	Something very interesting that I liked in the instructions was this step where you must add those three 2x2 yellow rounded pieces under the chopper.

3	This is for support while you build, which is handy, and later you take it off: And even later use it as the cargo.

3	I found that to be rather innovative and clever, as well as - Hey!

3	What are you hitting me for?

3	Both instruction booklets have the same back: Now heres the Chopper itself.

3	I love the design of it, it isn't quite minifig scale but its great all the same.

3	This is my first non-Xpod or House creator set, and it sure is fun.

3	Here me and iamded go for a dizzy ride.

3	I love the nose of the copter, and the landing gear is fantastic.

3	A shot from the other side.

3	Oh dear, it seems we've been a bit sick from that ride, and were vomiting transgreen 1x1s.

3	The cargo itself is nicely made, though I forgot to put on two tiles here :-$ .

3	It fits in real well with the chopper to, and the line is great for giving iamded the wedgie he deserves: This is my first power function set, so I was pretty excited.

3	The motor is intergrated really well into this set, and is activated by pushing that little 3x2 plate with the 1x1 slopes on it forward, until it hits the motor button, that orange knob.

3	Another point of interest is the use of bley barrels on each side.

3	I like this as I don't have those pieces in that colour.

3	A shot of the motor.

3	Its really simple, all you do is pull the hook out to any length that allows, then press the orange button and it will wind it back up.

3	This makes the Chopper pull the cargo up into its bay, and iamded pull me here reluctantly to a whacking: A top view, is that MY head?

3	A view of the chopper without the cargo in it.

3	I love the lowered cockpit: The leftover pieces from building: (NOTE: iamded's head does not count as set piece) And a final shot of the set with me and iamded.

3	Oh, it appear we're dead, oh dear... Hope you enjoyed this review, soon I will post the two alternate models.

3	I loved this chopper, its great to play with and has nice construction.

3	It also has some handy pieces too.

3	The motor function sounds like a gimmick but is well intergrated into this model.

3	Well worth the price, so far this is another win for Creator I say!

3	So far I recommend this model, but later we'll see if the alt models are up to scratch.

3	Also, since this is my first review, comments and criticism welcome on everything.

3	Batbrick Away!

3	Great review, Batbrick!

3	Iamded got what he deserved.

3	X-D

3	Thank you very much for a fine review, Batbrick.

3	*y* What the....

3	I never realized these cool grey barrels till now.... that?s pretty interesting.

3	:-) The whole Chopper looks very good, with a well fitting power function.

3	It?s for sure a rewardable work to change that baby into a real MF version with accessible cockpit.

3	:'-)

3	Great review!

3	Keep them coming!

3	I might get this set now.

3	I must have those grey barrels... Oh dear... :-D X-D :-P X-D This was a hilaruos review, too.

3	Edited by ~VBBN~, 10 February 2008 - 11:21 PM.

3	I am definitely getting this set.

3	Thanks for the nice review!

1	I wish I could just get those grey barrels alone, the rest of the set doesnt really intreigue me much :-$ Thanks for the review.

3	Thanks everyone, heres part 2: The second instruction booklet includes instructions for both alternate models, which is good, I hate having too many manuals: Here she is, the plane: Its very nice and well proportioned, but where did iamded get that laser?

3	Overview, the landing gear is very sturdy and nice, and the wings are surprisingly good: Top view, iamded's head fell into the propellers, I was trying to save him, honest!

3	A view of how the motor on this one works, by pushing the orange button you can make the prop spin.

3	It is well integrated like the chopper, though the prop only spins for about 2 1/2 seconds.

3	Still, its a nice feature: The tail is also well made, simple, but lovable.

3	Oh, and check out that tank!

3	The prop spinning, Agh!

3	Is that MY hand?

3	Final view, there seems to be some sort of explosion here 8-| Well I think I got iamded more than me atleast.

3	The second model is also great, though not as good as the chopper.

3	The lack of space to fit something into the cockpit brings it down a bit, but it is a very nice model overall.

3	I recommend it, though unlike the chopper it will be hard to mod into minifig scale.

3	So far so good with 4995, here are the leftover pieces from the model: Enjoy!

3	Batbrick Away!

3	This looks like a wonderful set, I love that plane!

3	It doesn't bother me that it's not mini-fig scale, as it looks more for display IMO.

3	*wub* Looking forward to seeing the final model!

3	*y* ~Peace

3	I really like this set... even though I was hoping for a mini-motor!

3	:-D Chock full of great parts too.

3	Thanks for the review.

3	*sweet*

3	Thanks guys, heres the final part: The Instructions for the boat begin on page 46: The overall set, its actually much nicer than I thought it would be, the pictures on the box make it look ugly.

3	Top view, Tommy Guns do not actually come with set ;-) Side view, the designers have done an excellent job with the hull, considering the lack of many slopes pieces.

3	You can see it is pretty much minifig scale too: Here you can see that by pushing in the red technic axle, the "anchor" on the front will be hauled back into the boat: Back view, these outboard motors are pretty cool, though I wish they could go own into the water more: Overall, though the weakest model, its still a lot of fun, and has a clever way around the lack of a shapely hull.

3	I was impressed with it after the building it, it even has two rounded SNOTTy bottom pieces on the nose of the boat to give the impression it is speeding through the water with the front lifting up.

3	Lots of leftover pieces for this one: The pieces: Sorry about the poor photograph there, it was getting late :-$ Overall the Cargo Chopper is another great set in the fantastic Creator line.

3	Loads of fun, great play, and some clever designs, it challenges you to make your own things, and even includes some nifty pieces (bley barrels!

3	*wub* ) I won't give it a rating, but I'll just say I certainly recommend it to fans of the theme and Lego fans in general.

3	Now, finally, iamded and I teamup in the face of a larger foe.

3	Get that Lord of Pies!

3	Batbrick Away!

3	Congrats to that nice review....

3	I like the Batcave set, you should also been able to find it at discount....

3	Thank you for your wonderful review! )

3	I was done very well.... ) I suggest that you will find "Two-Face's Escape" set a very interesting one to build....

3	It also provides great playability and is not very expensive for what you will get. )

3	Good day to you. )

3	Thanks for that nice review.

3	I still don't think I will get this set though.

3	Try ePay.

3	I found it there for 38 euro (and picked up two of them).

3	Nice price for loads of nifty material.

3	Thanks for the review Aayla, I love this set and its great to see another person interested in Batman.

3	Now all you have to do is start watching the movies, then the cartoon series, then the comics, then the......... X-D I really recommend Two-Face's Escape as well, a great set for a great price.

3	And BTW, the Green Dude as you call him is named Killer Croc, he is a killer with a freakish skin condition.

3	Batbrick Away!

3	>:-)

3	It is a tie between Two Face's escape and the batcave... but I would go with the cave... over 1000 pieces, nifty submarine, penguins, alfred, mr freeze, and and and.... it is wonderful...!

3	especially for 38?!!

3	:-) ol' style Batman ON!

3	(yep, this is a lil' rant on 2008 batman.. :-P )

3	6258 Smuggler's Shanty Overview Smuggler's Shanty was released in 1992, it consisted of 69 pieces, 3 minifigs (two pirates, one Imperial) and it cost $9.25 (USD).

3	The set itself is a small but rather sturdy den for the pirates!

3	Review: The minifigs consist of two pirates and one Imperial.

3	The minifigs are not all that rare, which is disappointing, I would of liked a rarer fig!

3	But still it is a good cheap source of pirate and Imperial figures.

3	Here is an overall shot of the set, which includes the three figs, the shanty which is made using palm leaves pieces, and a nice grey shark nibbling at the soldier's oar.

3	A close up of the soldier rowing hard in his boat.

3	I would have preferred to have a normal soldier with shako hat, as I have more officers than normal soldiers now!

3	: And a close up snap of the main structure.

3	Note the wine glass, which was a nice touch!

3	Funnily enough, only 4 pieces of treasure were included in this set, compared to the usual 8 gold coins in other sets.

3	A view from the back, which also gives a good view of the pieces used to construct the shanty mainly simple black 1 by 1 bricks: The Shanty looks good from most angles but their are a few where the roof construction looks rather odd, but that is just a minor nitpick!

3	Yet another view from the front,, this time at a slightly different angle.

3	The yellow base plate looks rather nice too, I prefer it over the tan pieces we trend to get nowadays: "Attack!!"

3	The Stupid drunk pirate in the background does not even notice!

3	Overall I think this is a rather good set, despite some shortcomings, such as the lack of treasure and odd roof from some angles.

3	The shark, Imperial soldier and useful parts make up for it, and of course the price is cheap on most auction sites, I got mine for a mere ?5 ($10), with the cheapest price on Bricklink being $8.

3	Rate the set then leave your comments, thoughts and opinions!!

3	!

2	First I'll comment on the review and at a later date I'll comment on the set.

2	You've done a top job Lord of Pies *y* You've captured the set from a variety of angles and posed the mini-figures interestingly.

3	Very nice review, Lord of Pies!

3	Thanks for taking the time to put this together, and especially for all the detailed pics.

3	*y* I very much regret that my dark ages occured when they did.

3	Basically, I missed out on all the cheap and easy troop building sets, and this one is certainly no exception.

3	The big sets are nice, but these are the ones that always make me wish just a little harder for a return of LEGO pirates... :'-) I gave it a 4 out of 5, just because I'd buy 4 out of 5 sitting on the shelves today, were it possible.

3	Great little set!

3	I bought this set only a few years ago MISB and I am still very happy about it.

3	The hut is simple but very effective as a castaway building on some deserted island, the palmleaves are a good addition to any Lego collection.

3	This set had a nice amount of weapons, two for each pirate and two of those weapons are flintlock muskets as opposed to just pistols.

3	Nice poll as well, but you made sure nobody can give this set a 1 which is very nice (but probably a little mistake :-D ).

3	I gave it the top-rating.

3	*y*

3	I gave it the top-rating.

3	*y* So I have, oops!

3	I never was very good at maths.

3	:-P

3	Wow.

3	I remember this set from when I was a kid.

3	I got it for my birthday and opened the package first.

3	Sadly, I had to go to school so I had to leave it at home and not build it or play with it until I got home.

3	Needless to say that was one of the longest days of school ever.

3	Good review, great set.

3	I bought one of these new from Bricklink a few months ago as part of my Pirate splurge I went on.

3	I really enjoyed this set because of the amount of figs in such a small set, though Pirates were always pretty good about their fig count.

3	Also the neat little hut is nicely done for its purpose.

3	Great review, btw!

3	Great small set that can help you add to you minifig count.

3	The little boats are always cool, and the den isn't that bad either.

3	Another first-rate review!

3	It's a nice little set with a big number of minifigs.

3	And 2 flintlock guns is also a nice bonus.

3	A very nice review of a pretty and neat little set, thanks Lord Of Pies, guess it´s a 3 for me, with strong tendencies to 4....

3	First of all excellent Review!

3	5/5 for me.

3	I have yet to attain one of these sets.

3	It has a nice trio of men including a redcoat, and a nice assortment of weapons.

3	The rest, such as the leaves, is great for MOCing.

3	imperialshadows, on Feb 19 2008, 08:41 PM, said: I gave it a 4 out of 5, just because I'd buy 4 out of 5 sitting on the shelves today, were it possible.

3	If I saw 5 of these sitting on a shelf I would certainly buy all 5, then I would ask to speak with a manager to see if there is any way I can attain more pirate Lego stuff.

3	simonwillems, on Feb 19 2008, 08:47 PM, said: Nice poll as well, but you made sure nobody can give this set a 1 which is very nice (but probably a little mistake :-D ).

3	I gave it the top-rating.

3	One should not step into the pirates domain and give a mere 1 to any non4+ pirate set.

3	Duke

2	woow :D this was my first LEGO set ever!

3	This set shows the awesomeness of classic pirate sets.

3	I really have to get me some more!

3	XD Great Review on a great set!

2	A nice review and a nice little set for anyone's Pirate collection.

2	A 5/5 for the review.

2	I'd give the set a 3 1/2 out of 5.

2	It needed 1 more Imperial to get a 4.

2	A bigger basplate would have been nice as it appears to hard to fit all the minifigs on the island.

2	Thanks for this great review

3	IMO this is a very simple and small set good to add some part to forbidden island.

3	good

2	Laurinator- I don't mind an occassional old review coming back to life for discussion, but it seems you've replied to many old reviews that have been stagnant for years.

2	Please try to refrain from "bumping" a lot of old topics as it pushes down new content that should really be the focus of discussion now.

2	Well since this topic has resurfaced, I would add my 2 cents about my appreciation of this set.

2	It was the first and (unfortunately) the largest Pirate set I owned as a kid, but I played the wazoo out of it.

2	Some of the minifigs have lost almost all their face printing after so many play sessions!

2	Theres just something about the hut that appealed to me more than the cheesy skull-face islands we keep getting.Probably that it wa kind of neutral, good for my pirates, settlers or islanders.

2	Though the palm leaves were rather fragile and used to break off the studded parts.

2	It would be nice to get more of these "beach village army builder" sets.

3	Hi guys.

3	I picked these up the other day, but it's taken me this long to get round to posting the reviews.

3	So, here we go: Tub comparison with a minfig (thanks Brainbox): The lighting changes a bit throughout the photographs, as it was going dark outside, so I only really had my desk light, and I kept getting in the way.

3	4837 Mini Trains Now the box I really like.

3	It's no different to those of last year's sets, but the colour here is simply fantastic, and really seems appropriate for the theme.

3	So this is what you get inside.

3	All the pieces are still inside the bag, the optical illusion was accidental :-D .

3	No pieces of particular outstanding interest, but the dark green cheese slopes are rather nice.

3	Look out for those later.

3	1 2 3 This is the main model, and uses all the pieces in the set (bar these two, which according to the inventory are spares, but as with all my other Creator sets, I'm cheating and leaving them in).

3	This is far and away the best model of the three, and evokes the iconic version of a steam train.

3	The green looks superb, but I'm not sure whether that's due to the model itself or the actual colour.

3	Moving on, we get to the second model: 1 Leftovers (yes, I admit, I was using a piece of paper) This isn't actually a bad model.

3	I don't think it's quite as nice as the previous one, but it's not bad.

3	It's different from the first model as well, which is good.

3	Too muich of the same can be a bad thing.

3	Finally, we come to the third model: Leftovers Now...

3	I'll be honest.

3	I don't really know what this is.

3	It's not that good a model compared to the other two.

3	That's all I can say, really.

3	And of course, all the pieces fit into the tub.

3	Overall: I have to say, I do like this set, despite the weak third model.

3	The strength of the primary and secondary models make up for any weaknesses in the third, and I can imagine the pieces being fully usuable in building other trains.

3	While the basic idea of these tubs isn't quite as good as the X-Pods with regards portability and general 'niceness' they aren't bad.

3	And for a fairly cheap price (?3-4) as well.

3	4838 Mini Vehicles This is one of those set boxes that you see because of the ridiculously loud colours.

3	Sound marketing scheme if you ask me.

3	I've managed it again.

3	There are pieces outside the bag.

3	Or are there?

3	Now these I like *y* .

3	1 2 (I don't know what the clip is for, there isn't one on the other side) 3 4 5 This is the main model of the set, and again all the pieces are used bar these three, the spares.

3	It's quite a nice model, although the car's a bit odd.

3	Still, I like the ramps, and the colour scheme reminds me just a little of G1 Ultra Magnus.

3	Hmm, I think that boom arm could do with refixing... 1 2 Leftovers This is actually quite nice as well.

3	It's that classic breakdown truck, and the boom arm itself is quite nice, with quite a bit of movement.

3	Another solid model.

3	1 Leftovers I'm surprised by the amount of detail here actually.

3	Not only have TLC included a spare wheel at the back, but also what looks like a trailer hitch, which all adds to the 'realism.'

3	Another nice model to round out a nice set.

3	And in the tub.

3	Overall: I'm not sure which of the two I like better.

3	When I bought them, and on the way home, I much preferred the train set.

3	But after building this set, I'm not sure.

3	This is another good set from the year when TLC seems to be giving us so many.

3	There are some good pieces in here too, and while there's nothing unique, they're still good.

3	So, thanks for reading, hope it helped someone, and if there are any requests, I'll see what I can do.

3	That's requests for pics, not songs ;-) .

3	Tks for that nice review, brainbox!

3	I recieved the construction diggers set like this last year.

3	Gee what a nice parts pack.

3	I like that orange lidded set, the truck.

3	So nice.

3	I won't get it though.

2	why not?

2	they are all very nice (i have all six of them), especially the helicopter, my least anticipated, but one of the most detailed!!

2	thanks for the review brainbox!

2	!

2	Thanks for the review Brainbox.

2	*sweet* These look really nifty* I might pick up a couple of these as for the parts, I'm sure they could come in handy for something.

2	And so cheap as well.

2	I still miss X-pods though.

2	:'-( *Do the kids still say nifty these days?

2	*wacko*

2	Plural, on Feb 20 2008, 12:25 AM, said: Do the kids still say nifty these days?

2	*wacko* I do.

2	But then, that's not very helpful, as I sit in English going through a book, listening to the class find archaic words, thinking "but, I still use those words."

2	:-D

3	Thanks for these great reviews Brainbox, I never expected you to do a review for some reason.

3	I love these mini sets, the Train in particular is great.

3	I won't get any though, those Indy sets are coming in fast and I'm gonna need all the money I can muster.

3	Still they are nifty little sets.

3	Batbrick Away!

3	>:-)

3	Brainbox, on Feb 20 2008, 02:55 PM, said: You're welcome guys.

3	:-D Sorry, that just made me laugh.

3	I did some research and re-read tyour review.

3	I will pick this up this weekend.

3	Quote Yeah, so do I.

3	They really were a neat idea.

3	I had all the x-pods.

3	They were awesome.

3	I haven' collected all of these though.

2	Mmmmh, I *wub* love the train... Great review.

2	It looks like each model can be connected to the other to make a complete train.

2	*y* *y* It makes me want to get 3 of them (or more) to make a long one.

2	:-D

3	So here it is finally, my first ever review of a lego set..oh wait, it's actually 2 sets.

3	So i don't really know how to do it right, but i'll try the best.

3	(Sorry if some pictures are a litte bit dark, but i'm not really into photography and i got bad light here) Let's Start with the Dwarf's Mine Defender: Theme: Castle 2008 Set Name: Dwarf's Mine Defender Number: 7040 Pieces: 86 Price: ?9,99 (EUR) First, as always, the box: The back, a few instructions on how the defender works, for those how don't know ;-) : And the instructions: We continue with the minifigs, sorry i forgot to make a closeup of the dwarf: And finally the mine defender itself, i personally think it isn't as bad as maybe some people think.

3	The chain for the catapult is great i think: I kinda love those controls, the mechanism with the rubbe rband actually works pretty well, but only on a not-glossy underground.

3	That's pretty much all of it, it's small but i like it a lot.

3	So let's go on to the tower raid now, which would be my absolute favorite of those new sets.

3	-------------------------------------- Theme: Castle 2008 Set Name: Tower Raid Number: 7037 Pieces: 364 Price: ?29,99 (EUR) Again, first the box & Instructions: We got 2 sets of instructios here, one for the tower and one for the siege tower: The Minifigs, we got one archer and one soldier here, both with the torsos of the 2007 sets: Now thw orc side, starting with the great leader, with the new armor and the golden helmet (i love those pieces!

3	): Closeup of the armor & helmet: Then we got another orc-knight: And the prisoner, with handcuffs!

3	The Crownie Tower looks great overall, though there is something i don't really like about it, but later on that.

3	Now the back, and that is what really bothers me, there areno walls on the first floor except the one with the wall-piece and the door, and theprison also is open at the back.

3	The orc easily could jump out there: Not sure what these are all about, they really don't add much to the set: Enough rant now, let's go on with a pretty sweet detail, the golden crystal on the little table: The wall piece on the first floor you can ram in: And finally the very best thing of this set, the amazing orc siege tower!

3	From the front: The great working ram, you can pull it back very far and it got pretty much power: Here we got another sweet detail, the siege "platform" that moves out by pulling a cord in the back of the tower: Finally a picture of a bit siege action: If you ram in the lower wallpiece, the brown shelfs of the prison-floor collapse and the prisoned orc is finally free!

3	Summary: Likes: As i mentioned before, i really think that's the best ever produced siege tower, it's got so mich details and works extremely well, also the overall look of it is magnificant.

3	The destroy-mechanism of the tower is pretty cool too, the brown door is a fine detail too.

3	Nothing much to say about the mine defender, i like this little set, and there's nothing really to bother about it.

3	Dislikes: The Back of the tower.

3	That's really the only thing that's a bit bad imo, they could have put there 2 more walls on the first floor and something to lock the prison easily.

3	Final Thought: The Tower Raid for me personally is the best of the 2008 sets so far, it's got great playability and looks simply good.

3	My opinion: Buy it!

3	Tks for these cool reviews metalandi !!

3	I love these orc sets !!

3	I am so going to get these ;-) I'm happy to see that scared face again (I love it really !!)

3	and the use of that handculfs !!

3	That new armour looks really cool That tower is really nice and I wont mod it that much which os cool and the battle ram is freaking sweet !!

3	Tks again for sharing ;-) *yoda*

3	Great review, pictures and all!

3	Thanks for showing all the mechanisms of the tower, I didn't notice them from either the pics we had or the instructions--it didn't hit me that when you knock down the wall the second floor breaks.

3	That is a genius idea.

3	This looks like a superb set, unfortunately my priority right now is the Troll Warship.

3	Still, if that really is U.S. $80, I might skip it and go for this instead, which is only $20 US.

3	One note, though.

3	I think there might not be a back cage on the second floor of the tower so that the mechanism can work.

3	Did you try to see if the second floor ground still falls if you add it a fourth cage wall?

3	Also, you could just pretend that the tower is built against a mountainside.

3	It would fit perfectly and add more defense to the Knights.

3	Great review!

3	:-) VK

2	Tks for those so much!!

2	:'-) *y* Nice reviews!

2	I love that tower raid, and the defender, and will buy them both.

2	Quote really don't add much to the set: Oh, but they do.

2	More pieces= higher price.

2	;-)

2	Thanks for these fantastic review.

2	It's the first time I take a good look at these sets.

2	There is a good chance I'll buy the Dwarf's Mine Defender, especially for that price.

2	This set didn't come with the new jail door piece?

2	I'd have guessed it would have, since there is an orc in prison.

2	Nice review.

2	I'm looking forward to picking up these sets.

2	Steve

3	Thank you for these fine reviews, metalandi.

3	*y* There?re really some nice playable features in the Tower raid set, and all these great Orc torsos, just sweet!

3	And it even looks like that black Orc-armor?s a new piece, lovely.... :'-)

3	Cheers for the reviews.

3	They're both nice sets, and I think I just may have to buy both.

3	Or maybe I'll get two of the dwarf set?

3	The figs in each are really cool as well.

3	The dwarf, well, they're just cool anyway, but the troll with the golden helmet and armour, that's just *wub*

3	Thanks for the double review, I like the Dwarf catapult but the real deal is the Tower Raid set.

3	I love that Siege Tower and love that new armour, can't wait to get it.

3	Thanks for the review!

3	Batbrick Away!

3	>:-)

3	The Tower Raid has the best price per piece ratio in the whole 2008 line.

3	Thanks for the review ^_^

3	Thanks metalandi!

3	These are 2 great sets, I'm definately looking forward to seeing these in New Zealand stores!

3	The collapsing floor/prisoner freeing mechanism on the tower is wonderful, a great touch.

3	Some slight modifications, like, some walls, will make this perfect.

3	And the Dwarf's Mine Defender is a sweet little set, with some neat minifigs.

3	Thanks for the reviews!

3	*y* ~Peace

3	Thanks for these great reviews!

3	*sweet* The dwarfs mine defender looks interesting, the figs though are *wub* The only thing missing is a weapon for the dwarf and some shields The battering ram and tower are awesome!

3	8-?

3	The Troll King with new torso, helmet, and body armor is simply amazing I like how the troll is handcuffed :-D The tower shows nice detail except for the poor "brig" .

3	I love that gold crystal!

3	The battering ram is a thing of beauty!

3	$30 for the Tower and Ram and $10 for the Defender are very well priced!

3	I still want the Battle Wheel more though!

3	Damn Exclusives!

3	:'-( >:-( P

3	Thanks for the review, I personally think the siege tower is probably the best one which Lego has ever produced.

3	Well, I don't think Orcs are that sturdy, seeing that they'd have to jump from the second level of the tower, I don't see survival as his chief objective!

3	:-P Awesome review!

3	I'm loving these sets more and more!

3	The Tower Raid is DEFINITELY the best and the cheapest set there!

3	>:-) Oh, and Pirhana, it's not really a 'king', it's more like an officer.

3	Remember, the Wizard rules these goblins!

3	Another excellent review!

3	Haha, that tower does reminds me of KK II of Mistland Tower =x Well, overall, i love these 2 sets very very much *sweet*

2	Thank you for the nice review.

2	Pity the tower is not designed better, but I still want to buy these 2 sets.

2	If only there were 2 dwarves in the DMDefender.

1	I got myself today 3 Dwarf's Mine Defender and I have to say that sets does suck big time: the plastic rubber band doesn't do squat, and 3 wheels i really not enough.

1	I only built 2 of those and changed the front of it with 4 wheels and no plastic rubber band and I changed the 2x2 dark bley plate.

1	Its still looks good but the crappy rubber band system is really not well thought off.

1	Anyhow my Orc army is growing >:-) *yoda*

1	xwingyoda, on Mar 1 2008, 06:32 AM, said: Its still looks good but the crappy rubber band system is really not well thought off.

1	*yoda* i totally agreed with your comments.

1	The rubber system is not effective at all.

1	I bought 2 defenders recently and i found out that when the wheels move, the rubber just stuck there without rotating the blades at the front :-/ I have not really found a solution for mine yet.

1	So far, i only took out the rubber band, placing the blades on the ground, removing of the red technic part on the left side.

1	In this way, when the defender is moving on smooth ground, the blades will move too ;-)

3	Thanks for the great review.

3	*y* The siege tower does look great.

3	I'll have to look out for these sets.

3	Hello Eurobricks!

3	My first post Yesterday i will buy this two sets!

3	I'm waiting for the packs!

3	Sorry but my English isn't good

2	Well you didn't say anything wrong yet undead army officer I perfer using the Batle wheel to knock down the Tower's walls, not the seige tower

3	The Rancor, on Apr 22 2008, 05:54 AM, said: I perfer using the Batle wheel to knock down the Tower's walls, not the seige tower I love all the siege machines the orcs have, they are certainly a much bigger threat than the skellies.

3	Batbrick Away!

2	Yeah, the open towers are kinda funny, although they were also typical of (for instance) 90s pirate sets.

2	The trolls' vehicles are cool though.

2	They look evil.

2	I can't wait to start collecting '08 Castle sets...(I didn't buy any Castle in '07, I only got one set for Xmas, so I'm catching up on the '07 stuff first before it's all sold out)

3	Now that this topic has been brought up again, I just want to say that the rubber band on my Dwarf Mine Defender actually works

3	They're so beautiful... 4 more months.

3	Green Grocer Reviewed by Dunamis Set 10185 2,352 Pieces $149.95 from The LEGO Store (Glendale, CA) Build time 6.5 hours Holy guacamole!

3	Almost exactly one year after Caf?

3	Corner was released we get the third installment in the increasingly popular LEGO exclusive town series.

3	Combined with the famous 10182 Caf?

3	Corner and its trusty companion 10190 Market Street this trio makes the foundation for an amazing city block of LEGO goodness.

3	For those new to this series of sets, check out my reviews of the two previous sets in this line: Cafe Corner Market Street I would not necessarily recommend reading too many of my reviews in one setting as you might experience loss of brain cells and/or drowsiness.

3	You have been warned.

3	So, how does Green Grocer stack up to the two previous sets you ask?

3	Well, follow along kind reader and I shall attempt to unravel this question.

3	The Box: The gigantic box is pretty standard and looks amazingly similar to the Caf?

3	Corner box.

3	The back of the box shows some of the features of the green grocer as well as a lot of the cool interior that was absent from the previous sets.

3	In addition, we are shown an image of the three sets together and a small insert image showing how they connect together (as if we could not master that difficult maneuver?)

3	Opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals.

3	As it seems to be the norm now, we have the reusable cereal box type tab system that we saw so often in 2007 sets.

3	However, upon opening the tabs we are pleasantly surprised to find a cardboard tray!

3	Have not seen one of those in a while.

3	As you can see in the photo, we have two 32x16 green base plates, three instruction manuals and a bunch of bags that are broken into four groups: Group 1 has 12 bags and goes with the first manual and builds the first floor.

3	Group 2 has 9 bags and goes with the second manual to build the second floor.

3	Group 3 has 14 bags and goes with the third manual for the top floor and roof.

3	And one bag that is not numbered and hence you can open it whenever you feel like it.

3	There are no stickers ?

3	Yay!

3	Moving right along, we get to the three instruction manuals.

3	The Manuals: The three manuals are 55, 47 and 47 pages in length.

3	They are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings: - Piece call outs for each step - Parts inventory at the end of the second manual - Page numbers Color separation in these manuals was fine for me except dark bley and black.

3	We get a nice photo of all three sets together: Plus, we get a nice tip showing how to split up the bags and what goes where.

3	Those additional pieces you see in the photo just below the numbered bags are the pieces that come from the single un-numbered bag (along with the base plates).

3	Parts list Random manual shot The Pieces: Upon opening the first set of bags, one thing is clear; there are a TON of little tiny pieces!

3	The minifigs are included in this first section as well.

3	Interesting to note that there are a handful of printed pieces and as I mentioned previously, no stickers.

3	We also get a host of new and exciting pieces to add to our collection.

3	Keep in mind my scope of LEGO sets is generally centered around Star Wars, Technic, Creator and the occasional racer set so what is new to me might have been around 15 years.

3	At any rate, here are some of the more interesting pieces: Again, note the printed tiles.

3	This time around, LEGO has decided to include 33% more minifigs than the Caf?

3	Corner and Market Street sets.

3	Yes, we get four minifigs instead of three!

3	Here are the cast of characters: Pictured (left to right) is Sir Top Hat, Miss Jenny Blue Overalls, Patti O?

3	Furniture and little Timmy Cub Scout.

3	I?ll leave it up to the minifig aficionados to decipher which torsos are new and to tell us all about the hairpieces.

3	I can say with reasonable certainty that the four yellow smiley heads are not new (somebody check that?)

3	Don?t forget the lovable little cat named ?Tom?.

3	He is the arch-rival of the mouse ?Jerry?

3	that lives downstairs: Overall, there are a lot of pieces, large variety and wide range of colors.

3	The Build: If you have either of the two previous sets, you will feel right at home here.

3	Just like in the previous builds, it seems like the first ten build steps are consumed with laying a bunch of 1x1, 1x2 and 2x2 tiles everywhere.

3	Almost feels like 30% of the pieces are used up right away (see below).

3	There are several sections where you build various parts of the interior.

3	Take a look at the cash register/counter below: And the beverage cooler: And the produce stand and everything that goes in it: Looks like someone has mail: Looks like someone just had a baby: This set is incredibly well done and gives inspiration to go back and add similar items to Caf?

3	Corner and Market Street.

3	As before, the average builder is introduced to some new building techniques like using the hinge plates to make the angles on the front of the building as shown below: Also the top of the roof shows some interesting ideas: Overall, it is a really fun build that kept me entertained the whole way.

3	The Design: This is a great set with lots of little details.

3	I especially like the little mouse hole in the wall leading to the Jerry the mouse?s area.

3	They even included a little slice of cheese!

3	It seems the designers can?t get away from the ?usual?

3	staircase which I always feel is way too big.

3	Maybe future designs can incorporate a spiral staircase to save room for other things in the model.

3	One welcome addition is the fire escape as seen below: I?m going to show a bunch of examples of various items in the set so you can get the feel of the amazing detail in this design.

3	Take a look at the lamps (torches?)

3	just outside the door: And the streetlight with fire hydrant: Brickwork and archway: Awning: Here is the back side of the building.

3	Note the trashcans and yard tools: Here is a close-up of the railings on the second story balcony and the second photo is the finished product with curtains in the window.

3	Nice use of cups to make the banister on the second floor: Here is the fireplace on the second floor: Second floor staircase with Tom?s hiding spot: Check out the radiator on the third floor: More third floor: Nice grandfather clock and rug (third floor) Check out the deck that is up on the roof.

3	Complete with two chairs, table, umbrella, flower pots and grill: Interesting use of minifig hammers on the roof: Finally, here is what is left over when we?re done: A couple of shots of the front: A shot of the back: And here are all three together: Overall Thoughts: This is an incredible set and the best of the three in my opinion.

3	It is hard to top Caf?

3	Corner but I believe Green Grocer just did.

3	I absolutely love all the details and building techniques that went into making this set.

3	There is a ton of different parts and wide color selection.

3	As usual, we get a bunch of tiles and small plates, but that goes with the series.

3	Also, we get four minifigs and lots of minifig accessories.

3	I?m giving this set a score of 100%!

3	I thought about it and I really don?t know how they could have made it any better.

3	In short, RUN don?t walk to go pick this set up!

3	Final Rating: 100% Build 10/10 (Excellent - Lots of nice interiors, details and accessories to build.)

3	Functionality 10/10 (Outstanding.

3	Raises the bar with interior and detail.

3	Think Caf?

3	Corner on steroids.)

3	Design 10/10 (Excellent ?

3	can?t say enough good things about it.)

3	Parts 10/10 (Great selection and diverse colors.

3	Great minifigs.)

3	Price 10/10 (Price ratio is excellent but lots and lots of little parts.

3	Well worth the price.)

3	As alway, feel free to comment, complain and question what you see here.

3	I'd like to hear your feedback on this amazing set.

3	Wow!

3	That's a great review I'm glad you took so many pictures, this set is far better than I ever expected it to be, the detail inside is great.

3	Is it the first set you'e given 100% to?

3	A great reveiw dunamis *y* .

3	You have only backed up what i thought when the pictures first appeared, if you are a lego fan there is no excuse not to buy this set.

3	It is a must have!

3	I love the mouse hole and the mouse and his cheese *wub* .

3	Damn you to hell Dunamis >:-( Now tks to you I really want the 3 sets put together X-D Wow that is what I call a sweet review 8-?

3	Tks for taking the time to make once again such a fantastic one ;-) The overall look of the building is brilliant and I love the nice additions they did: the cheese and mouse (Jerry :-D ) is hilarious !!

3	I didn't know Green Grocer had a rodent infestation !!

3	And the use of the new built furniture and detils like the radiator is freaking awsome !!

3	Also that set has a definite plus for me: its the back details !!

3	I love the stairs, the deck with table !!

3	Wowx that is what I call sweet backdoor details !!

3	Now its clear that I will need to buy the 3 sets asap !!

3	Tks once again Dunamis ;-) *yoda*

3	Very nice.

3	Very nice, indeed.

3	Lots of lovely, little details, even at the back.

3	This review hasn't changed my opinion one bit, I'm still looking forward to when I can finally pick up mine at the post office.

3	I'm crossing my fingers that there will be more buildings following after this one.

3	I'm guessing that LEGO's just testing the waters to see how far AFOL's are willing to go regarding price vs. details.

3	Green Grocer is still epic, though.

3	For some silly (and quite delusional) reason I thought that I had a chance to review this first... :-D But yours is at your house, and mine is (hopefully) winging it's way to me... :'-) Thanks for the review!

3	It will help me survive until mine arrives.

3	I love this set.

3	*wub* Hopefully there will be many more stunning sets like this to come.

3	*sweet* xwingyoda, on Mar 8 2008, 08:03 PM, said: I didn't know Green Grocer had a rodent infestation !!

3	Neither did I and I have looked through the instructions at least three times... :-$

3	*Runs to Lego Store in Bluewater...* M.

3	What a beautiful set, TLC give the designer a pay rise immedietly.

3	I was lucky to order one of these while they were on sale to us aussies ;-) but dont worry lego the $100 you saved me will be spent on more sets like this.

3	Carn't wait to watch my kids rescue residents in distress from those upper level windows with the fire fighters.

3	Man, these sets are so awesome.

3	Incredible work done by the designers there, must have took a long time to get all this ogether.

3	if they weren't too expensive i would go and buy them all 3 right away *wub*

3	damn it !

3	what a great great review !

3	I definitly love this set !!!!

3	burn credit card, burn !

3	you're the must in there Dunamis !

3	many thanks !

3	Like the set, this review also deserves a 10/10.

3	I've ordered this set yesterday on S@H. Seeing and reading this review, I'm convinced it will be worth the money.

3	So, Bonaparte is finally entering the City theme !!

3	!

3	Great review, great set.

3	I can't mine until after Easter.

3	*weeps*.

3	This is a nice review, thanks for all the great pictures!

3	Truly an awesome review.

3	Thanks Dunamis.

3	I ordered my two copies (one to build, one to store in the "vault") last week.

3	Can't wait to get this one!

3	The attention to detail here is what makes the set great.

3	There's nothing to criticize about this set.

3	It's really the closest thing to perfection that I have seen from TLC.

3	The difference between this set and CC is the interior detail, and because of that, GG now become (in my opinion) the best set EVER released by TLC.

3	Do the CC/GG/MS sets fit well with the 50th anniv.

3	town plan?

3	My impression is that out of the box, at least, they don't.

3	Which is too bad.

3	However, I don't think it would be hard to mod the Town Plan so it looks like it belongs in the same town as CC/GG/MS.

3	These sets, to me, are what I have always wanted from TLC as an adult.

3	I hope they keep up the line, and add more elements to this excellent lineup.

3	wow,, thanks for the nice review!

3	I have the other 2 sets and waiting for this to come to our shores.

3	Stupendous Design and Details!

3	I really like the "hammer-rails" on the roof.

3	CANt wait!!!

3	*wub*

3	Thanks for all the feedback.

3	As you can tell, I really enjoyed building it.

3	Cardinal Brick, on Mar 8 2008, 09:26 AM, said: Is it the first set you'e given 100% to?

3	Yes, it is.

3	I gave Cafe Corner a 96% and I felt this was a better set and improved on the things that I dinged Cafe Corner on (lack of minifigs was one thing.)

3	That's why I enjoy reading the comments so I can see if my ratings are in line with what everyone else thinks and to see if I missed anything.

3	I can't wait for some of you to build it and share your thoughts as well.

3	A very fine review with great and informative pictures, thanks dunamis!

3	*y* And what a wonderful set, a masterpiece and far beyond everything I would?ve expected just one year ago....

3	The amount of details is exceptional, from the different railings to the mousehole and the radiator.... sheer brilliant.

3	:'-) And two female MFs (or hippies, you never know....) and a child.... only one adult male character who nearly looks like.... well, anyways.

3	It?s simply a milestone, and a very creative and inspiring beauty.

3	*wub* Easter Parade on!

3	And, sweet GG.... will you marry me?

3	:-$

3	O. M. G. I MUST HAVE THAT SET!!

3	:'-) *y* *wub* I remember you telling me that you were going to do a review of this set, and I was so anxious!

3	I love these reviews!

3	Thanks so much!

3	Great pictures.

3	*wub* *y* *y* This will dent my wallet.

3	8-| I am so envious!

3	A very informative review, indeed.

3	Thank you so much for doing so.

3	Now I know that the price is worth every penny leaving my pocket.

3	;-) What do you guys think is TLC putting up as the next modular set?

3	Is it asking too much of TLC to produce 1 modular set each quarter (4 times a year)?

3	A million thanks for this review.

3	This is greater than I thought.

3	I especially like that clock.

3	I'm going to get this set as soon as possible.

3	:-) AMAZING!!!

3	Great Review!!!

3	:-D U have totalyl convinced me to get this set!

3	Its so wonderful, filled with great details.

3	What a waste, i can't order it in S@H because i am from Singapore :'-( I hope it will come to my country, so i am able to buy it!!!

3	:-)

3	Thank you for the amazing review Dunamis!

3	This set looks amazing *wub* I won't be able to afford it though :'-( Congrats!

3	This is on the frontpage *y* *sweet*

3	Great review.

3	Thanks for taking the time to do this.

3	This has been a great line.

3	At the risk of abandoning my Castle/Adventurer loyalties.

3	I've got to say this is rapidly becoming my favorite line and this set looks to be the best of the lot.

3	While it still hurts to shell out $150, I think I'll still be happy to do so.

3	Steve

3	Thank you sooo much for this amazing review Dunamis!

3	i absolutly adore this set and you've review has prompted me to certainetly start saving!

3	(i have a bit left over form christmas that will come in handy!

3	:-D ) I love the little fridge downstairs, the fire escape and the mouse hole, alot more good ideas that we can all use in creating our own buildings!

3	This line is by far my favorite lego line ever!

3	(yes even beats starwars, but only just ;-) ) Hooray for Dunamis!

3	X-D

3	I?ve got something, I want to share with you.

3	A beautiful dream came true: #1: the box: Top: Back: the alternate model is also very well done.

3	The pneumatics dump the bucket and open the flap (?).

3	Open: you can see a diagram how the pneumatics work.

3	Just a happy kid playing.

3	The plastic inlays (?

3	): All: #2: the parts: As you can see, 8854 offers a very large variety of different parts.

3	Loads of Technic bricks, gears and even plates.

3	Also note the threaded axle 10, 5 large pulleys, a big turntable and the 1x20 Rack.

3	#3: building: The mechanism for the outriggers and the rotation of the turntable: The turntable: The pneumatics are finished: The mechanism for the telescope: The finished model: #4 random shots: You can see how the turntable will be rotated.

3	Thanks for reading- erm?

3	viewing the pictures!

3	Please comment if you want to!

3	Really cool set!

3	This has convinced me that I really want it!

3	Wow, another old technic set review by you.

3	Nice set, and thanks for that review.

2	Looks like you have the original 1989 version with the yellow top cylinders.

2	:-) I got one too several years ago, although I probably paid too much for it.

2	:-P On a side note, if that pneumatic tubing feels harder and stiffer than the modern type, I highly recommend that you don't use it and buy some of the newer stuff off Bricklink instead.

2	TLC originally used a different material for the tubes and this stuff degrades the nozzles (on pistons, switches and so on) over time.

2	The old tubes also grip the nozzles much more firmly and if you aren't careful when removing them, it's actually possible to rip off the nozzles completely.

2	X-O I had this happen a few years ago, although TLC replaced my broken pistons for free.

2	I got rid of that stuff for good after that, although the pistons on my Power Crane still have slightly discolored nozzles.

2	X-O I actually noticed that while taking it apart but didn't really pay any attention.

2	I just thought that's because it's an old part.

2	Well, thanks for the information!

3	Great pictures, especially the perspective from overhead.

3	This is one of my favorite Technic models because it packs so many features in a relatively small space.

3	And I'm working on documenting this one in Technicopedia right now!

3	Thanks for the photos, Eric

3	Thanks for another fun review!

3	This set is high on my list of things to buy, I love cranes, built many and bought many including the classic 8460 from 1995 and the more recent 8421.

3	That threaded axle never stopped intriguing me...

3	It was use in so few sets (I believe 8851 contained one as well?)

3	and I still don't know why it's better than any other axle.

3	Congratulations with a near mint copy of this set!

3	:-)

2	simonwillems, on Mar 10 2008, 01:32 PM, said: That threaded axle never stopped intriguing me...

2	It was use in so few sets (I believe 8851 contained one as well?)

2	and I still don't know why it's better than any other axle.

2	The purpose of the threaded axle is to carry tension.

2	Regular axles are used primarily for carrying torsion (for gears), sometimes for compression (8855 landing gear, helicopter skids), and sometimes just for looks (roll cages, canopies).

2	But used in tension, connectors will usually just pop off.

2	With the threads and the corresponding nuts, this part can be used to squeeze parts together (like the pen in the plotter of 8094), or to hold heavy assemblies onto turntables (like 8862 and 8851).

2	With the power crane (8854) reviewed here, that is the complete list of sets which used this part.

2	I wrote about it here: http://www.ericalbre...1984.html#Parts Eric

3	As I bought it, I didn't even know I would also get a box.

3	It just said: all parts with building instructions.

3	After opening the parcel I was like: "woah... woooaaahhh" and so on.

3	;-) I love LEGO-boxes because as a child I stood in the toy stores starring at the boxes, only seeing the front and the back, nothing more.

3	This brings back some memories... :'-)

2	Blakbird, on Mar 10 2008, 09:45 PM, said: I wrote about it here: http://www.ericalbre...1984.html#Parts Eric Thanks for that information, it opened my eyes as to the function of the threaded axle!

2	:-)

3	Thank you very much for that review!

3	I bought it some years ago for the b-model, and like it so much :D

2	This was my first Pneumatic Set

3	This was my first technic set, aged 7!

3	Still a great one in terms of function density, and a great B-model.

3	In the UK I'm certain it was called the "Salvage Hoist".

2	Hi!

2	This is my third (old-school) technic set review!

2	I don?t want to talk much, please enjoy just the pictures!

2	#1 the parts: #2 building: The two axles, you can see in the middle, are not connected and don?t belong to each other.

2	The axle on the left side is for the steering, on the right side for the engine.

2	The dark-gray ?Technic Gear 16 Tooth with Clutch?

2	allows the connection from the differential gear to the engine, trough the axle for the steering.

2	The V6-engine: The winch: That?s a part you don?t see everyday: a 1x2 Rack.

2	It only reappears in 2 sets from 2001 and 2004.

2	(The Rebel Wrecker has been released in 1994.)

2	The ?Front double wishbone with anti-sway bar?-suspension (yeah, I got it from Technopedia!

2	X-D ) The finished model: #3 random shots: I really like this picture!

2	Authoritative, isn?t it?

2	8-?

2	:-D Thanks for viewing the pictures!

2	Please comment if you want to!

3	Thanks for reviewing all these old sets!

3	Will you be doing any more?

3	yeah.

3	If I rebuild and wash a model I will record it.

3	Glad to see you liked it!

3	This set is really cool.

3	I might actually get it!

3	Ah a good old retro review.

3	Those old school days had some pretty impressive sets, with alot more complexity than modern sets.

3	If you have it may I recommend 8880?

3	Nice pictures.

3	I also sort out the pieces the same way if I'm rebuilding a model.

3	*y* This set packs a lot of functionality into a fairly small size, but was rather expensive for its size ($70) when it was still available, compared to other sets of that time.

3	You can also rig up the Technic flag sticker that it comes with to the main model.

3	I've done that on mine.

3	You may want to reinforce it with tape if you're going to leave the model on display though, as it will break up over time due to UV exposure like many stickers do.

3	I had to do that with mine after it started to crack, although it still looks pretty good.

1	the only original stickers are the front headlight-patterns on the 2 red 1x2 bricks.

1	The others have been destroyed - must have been the bad decaying sticker quality that breaks when you'll remove it - so I printed them.

1	I didn't print the flag for only the alternate model needs it, although it's a neat idea...!

1	and LordGalewind: clickey!

1	I keep that in mind.

1	One of my 8880 is already dusty enough!

3	Thanks for reviewing this classic set.

3	I got it when it first came out and still love it: the suspension, steering and robust look of the model haven't been done that well ever since.

3	This set puzzled me though, back in the days.

3	The rear suspending part containing the differential and some gears was shown different on the box from the instructions.

3	In the instructions it showed that the (grey part of the suspension) in the back had to be made using a 1x2 smooth tile and 4 cornerplates (2x2) in grey.

3	The box however showed a much sturdier solution using a 1x8 tile and a 1x8 plate.

3	It is also visible on the cover of the instructions.

3	The pieces I mean are in this picture: BerndDasBrot, on Mar 9 2008, 07:05 PM, said: Otherwise, great set!

2	Thanks!

2	You've just motivated me to go on a "senseless-preliminary-design-errors-hunt"...!

2	A few things I've discovered: Left Side (Alternate Model): the steering link can only be put in place with a little violence... the handlebar (?)

2	is turned (far more than it's actually possible) although the wheels are straight.

2	Right Side: The 1x8 Tile simonwillems pointed out The half bush right next to it is... *can't_find_the_words* ..."wrong".

2	Could be that the Technic Triangle is missing.

2	The "windscreen"- 1x6 Technic Plates are mounted with 1/2 pins instead of Axle Pins with half bushes.

2	Who can find more...?

2	X-D

2	hmm, seems like the wheels are recycled into the harley truck in the 2008 batman set!

3	natelite, on Mar 10 2008, 05:57 PM, said: hmm, seems like the wheels are recycled into the harley truck in the 2008 batman set!

3	nope.

3	the harley-truck-wheels are thinner and somewhat more modern.

3	I do believe they're the same like in 8274.

3	Aaaaaaaand: for a long time in my life these wheels have been the best and coolest looking I've ever had!

3	So where's your deference?

3	:-D recycled... |-/ X-D

1	I've seen a few cases like this where the box pictures are slightly different from the actual model.

1	The Airtech Claw Rig compressor is another one that comes to mind.

1	The changes sometimes seem pointless and make you wonder why they bothered.

1	:-P Quote the only original stickers are the front headlight-patterns on the 2 red 1x2 bricks.

1	The others have been destroyed - must have been the bad decaying sticker quality that breaks when you'll remove it - so I printed them.

1	I didn't print the flag for only the alternate model needs it, although it's a neat idea...!

1	The other stickers on mine have held up pretty well, although I didn't try to remove them after I put them on.

1	The flag started to break after a year or so and just fell off its axle at one point.

1	I taped over it and it's holding up well now, although it's a little frayed along one edge.

1	This is actually the earliest set I've seen that uses this crappy sticker material (which is unfortunately very common today).

1	Even other Technic sets had good stickers for many years after that.

3	BerndDasBrot, on Mar 10 2008, 05:56 PM, said: You've just motivated me to go on a "senseless-preliminary-design-errors-hunt"...!

3	Man..., this set is a disaster what were they thinking!

3	:-D :-P I just remembered one other fun aspect of this set: The crane hook can be attached to the underside of the rear bumper, to hold it in position while driving along, but when things are like this and you try and wind up the cable the winch is strong enough to break the (original provided Lego) rope....

3	It 'worked' with my copy.

3	:-D So this set is capable of demolishing itself....

3	But still, one of the best Technicsets I have, with all stickers intact.

3	I'm not so sure about that flag though, must check on that.

3	Wow, that first picture is great!

3	You must have a very wide angle lens with the capability to focus very close (macro).

3	The perspective makes the model look huge.

3	Nice work.

3	I think the suspension on this set is my favorite of all Technic.

3	It has such large travel and is so.... what word should I use..... "bouncy".

3	Hey, why do you only review sets which are red?

3	:-D Eric

2	Blakbird, on Mar 10 2008, 09:35 PM, said: Hey, why do you only review sets which are red?

2	:-D I exactly thought that today as I made the pics for my signature...!

2	X-D At my school leaving examination I made a model in Blender3D and explained to the board of examiners how to build a car and how to animate it.

2	It needed a color, so I took red "because all beautiful and fast cars are red..." My physics teacher contradicted.

2	:-)

3	A neat review of a cool set with very informative pictures, thanks BerndDasBrot!

3	*y*

2	Any physics teacher would have to admit that a really fast car, approaching the speed of light, will always look red as it drives away due to red shift!!

2	X-D On the other hand, 8880 looks pretty fast and it is black, although I have seen pictures of one that someone built in red.

2	Yellow might be good too.

2	Some cars even look fast in green.

2	Eric

3	I can remember that I've seen a few color variations on brickshelf and on ebay (They sold well).

3	It's new and familiar at the same time.

3	That makes it more interesting!

3	Reread your review today!

3	Great pictures!

3	This IS a fabulous model.

3	Got this model a few months ago for just € 25!

3	It is small and has great working parts.

3	I love the way the front-suspension is made!

3	Epic!

3	I only had the light-stickers replaced with trans-clear bricks.

3	BTW: The gear rack has been used in this years 8048 Buggy!

3	I also happened to receive this set this weekend, virtually MISB (the seals on the side of the box were loose, however everything inside was untouched).

3	This little beast a joy to build and even more so to play with!

3	As indicated by Eric on the technicopedia page, it's crammed with functions for a medium-sized set.

3	I think I love it even more than my son does

3	I read blackbirds technopedia page on this truck the other week, went onto ebay and picked up a MISB copy for £25 GBP Bargin, great to get old sets unopened, peeling the plastic off of the specialist parts was always cool!

3	Love the front suspension

2	That price is exceptional.

2	It's less than what I paid for mine 9 years ago, and is even less than the original price of the set.

2	Note that the stickers in this set are the bad variety that will crack and peel over time.

2	If you want to preserve them (the Technic flag in particular), you will need to tape over it.

3	Somehow I also managed to get this set in very good condition (including box, instructions and all stickers) for a mere €22 a few months ago.

3	This is indeed a very special set, and was a pleasure to build.

3	The only flaw I noticed was weak support of the rear drivetrain, which was easily corrected with a few extra plates.

2	Don't have that much problems with that rear train.

2	(At least if i you don't trow the model down the stairs or something like that...) Maybe it's unusual, but this section of the drive train didn't hold that well on my model: This is how it looks now: The parts made redundant were left in the built model, that's why there's that useless 8-tooth gear there :P

3	Hello, my dear friends!

3	Here's something new.

3	I am actually making a review with pictures!

3	Yes, I got a new camera for christmas.

3	Now I was testing to see how the camera would reflect, so some of the pics are a bit blurry.

3	I have based this review from Dunamis's reviews.

3	He is my inspiration.So, without further ado, I bring you the Review!

3	Set #: 7693 Name: ETX Alien Strike Price: $19.99, ?12,99 Pieces: 246 Box: Okay, so as you can see below, the Box is pretty simple.

3	As always, European versions won't have the Piece count, name, etc, just the Number I believe.

3	Mine, having the American Version, has the info on it.

3	as you can see, it has the Classic MM logo, and the red Planet, as well as the set in a pose itself.

3	Very Nice.

3	I linked it because the Pic wasn't resizing.

3	http://www.brickshel...ke/dscn0017.jpg Below is the back of the box.

3	It shows the other sets and some features of this set.

3	Contents: Next we have the Contents.

3	This set includes a medium sized DSS (xwingyoda), a bag labeled one, and HUGE bag labeled two, the 1 bag contains a smaller bag, and the two bag includes two smaller bags.

3	5 bags in all.

3	Also pictured are the instructions.

3	I have linked it due to the non-resize.

3	http://www.brickshel...ke/dscn0019.jpg Figs: Included in this set are three figs.

3	Two jellies, and 1 astro.

3	The jeelies are fine, but I pefer the LoM ones.

3	But they glow.

3	Those new alien commanders for Summer look promising though.

3	The astro is nice, and includes an extra gold Visor.

3	MOC ON!

3	Astro Miner: In all MM sets there is a human and alien set.

3	The Astro par of this set is a Mini-miner.

3	Here is a pic of construction and that wonderful space logo sticker.

3	Not Much of a cockpit.

3	:-/ Finished Miner(The set number, too): Overall I like the miner, and It is nicely designed.

3	I feel the cockpit is lacking though.

3	Aliens: The alien Vehical is the Main part of the set.

3	This pic shows the beginning steps.

3	Solid and sturdy.

3	But those four axles/pin parts(blue) are pointless.

3	No support, and they don't get used at all.

3	Nice TLC.

3	:-| Now we get cooking!

3	This pic shows the tail added on and the more bulk being built.

3	We get a little repetitive and build the craft up in this pic.

3	And this pic from the instructions shows how the alien craft transforms for battle.

3	The completed set and extra bits.

3	Parts: 8/10 Figs 8/10 Price Per Piece ration: 9/10 Playability: 9/10 Overall: 85% The alien craft is great.

3	The attack feature is nice and there are a ton of trans green parts.

3	The alien falls out of the cockpit when turned upside down.

3	I love this set, and it's perfect for MM fans or beginners.It has nice parts, and read the above part for more details.

3	Gallery when Moderated.

3	Keep an eye out for future reviews!

3	Please comment.

3	:-)

3	Thanks for the great review VBBN!

3	*y* I already own 2 of these X-D On your camera there should be a little flower sign, switch to that to go to micro mode ;-) It's a really good first review *y* *sweet*

1	A nice review, well done!

1	*y* The set itself doesn?t look quite interesting to me, compared with some of the newer ones like 7647 or 7648.... the way the driver fits into the cockpit looks not very clever and pretty uncomfortable as well.... X-D

1	thanx for the review.

1	i have one question.

1	do these aliens have moving arms?

1	as far as the set goes i think lego did a bad job on the alien ship.

1	i dont think any of the alien ships look good in Mars Mission the human fanction got a lot better this year and i would have bought this buggy if it came by its self..

1	My friend has this set and the alien ship's wings are wobbly and overall :-X He may have built it wrong, I'm not sure, I didn't see the build.

1	Anyways, nice review!

1	*y*

3	Sweet first pic review!

3	*y* I got this set for a birthday present last year, and it is pretty fun overall.

3	The alien ship in this set is actually one of my favorites.

3	It just looks cool, and the way you can fold it out is really clever.

3	The only negative for me is the cockpit of the mining unit.

3	Not really because it isn't detailed, but because mine is top heavy, and keeps falling forward.

3	It's kinda funny if you think about him driving along and then falling forward...but not funny at all when you're playing.

3	|-/

3	Cool review.

3	Thanks for the Comments everyone!

2	Thank you for your nice review, vbbn!

3	I do like this set, though I am not a fan of the jelly aliens, though The alien ship looks good with the curved parts and flip open and close design!

3	Well, as bad a concept aliensvshumans is for a theme...

3	I really do like this set.

3	The human rover has nice parts for reuse, especially those oldschool space wheels.

3	And despite those wobbly wings, I really like the alien ship.

3	goes from a flying saucer-ish shape to a spread winged almost raven shape, very ominous and cool looking.

3	Now that 'alien commander' is terrible... if I don't buy bionicle minifigs already, why would I be interested in that thing?

3	Kinda wish they'd take the Drones from the retiring ExoForce theme and do them in green, they'd make nice alien robot things...

3	Hi!

3	This is my forth (old-school) technic set review!

3	Since blakbird pointed out that all my technic reviews are red, I chose a yellow dune blaster for today!

3	just kidding.

3	this set is red as it should be!

3	(Don't worry my next reviews will be yellow and black... uhhh forshadowing... ;-) ) I will start with some facts!

3	277 elements and released in 1994 that's enough.

3	#1: the box: #2: the parts: #3: building instructions and catalogues: Wow!

3	No folds, no wear marks - simply: *wub* "Was lesen coole Kids?"

3	- "KLICK!

3	Das super Magazin fuer coole Kids!"

3	(How obvious...) #4: building: No differential.

3	I really love the way the 1x8 Technic Bricks on the sides will be positioned later.

3	Fun fact: the engine contains no 2L-Technic Axle.

3	...and finished.

3	A real quick build.

3	#5: spare parts: ...for the alternate model.

3	The yellow Technic Handle should be from 8412.

3	Maybe a bonus feature from the seller!

3	#6: random shots: #7: final thoughts: This is my second 8829 and I also noticed that the engine turns very hard.

3	The alternate model is really (sorry to all those of you who like it) crappy.

3	I mean- a nice idea, but not with this wheels!

3	:-| Anyway: a really beautiful Technic-set!

3	*reminiscing* (this word exists, does it?)

3	thanks for viewing the pictures, I hope you enjoyed it!

3	Please comment if you want to!

3	Edited by BerndDasBrot, 21 March 2008 - 02:09 PM.

3	That looks like a very nice set!

3	:-) In your opinion, how does it compare to the current Dune Buggy?

3	-Toa Of Justice

2	I don't own the 8296, but what I can see from the pictures, I would say that 8296 is very similar to 8829.

2	The only things that are different ist that 8296 is studless and features a steering wheel for the seat.

2	But 8829 has got bigger wheels... >:-) It also would have been nice, if the wheels from 8296 could have the same tread.

3	A very good review with fine and informative pictures, and a really nice set, thanks, BerndDasBrot.

3	*sweet* Hmm, I really wish that TLC would make some steerable cars within the System line too....

3	Great set, great review, although the set looks better in yellow.

3	A great set review, as always.

3	Nice try making a review of a set that was not red.

3	It almost worked!

3	Maybe next time.

3	*sweet* One thing I noticed is that a bunch of your pictures are missing the beam that goes over the left hand wheel as a fender.

3	Like this picture: What kind of camera do you use?

3	The pictures have very good depth of field, meaning that both the foreground and the background are in good focus.

3	This is usually hard to do without a very small aperture.

3	Yes, "reminiscing" is a word.

3	It means to fondly remember the past.

3	I also noticed that the engine was sticky.

3	Set 8408 has the same problem.

3	It took me forever to figure out what the problem was.

3	If you take the engine out of the model, it turns nice and smooth.

3	Then when you put it back in, it works terrible.

3	It turns out the key is that, in the back, there is an 8 tooth spur gear and a 24 tooth crown gear used as a spur.

3	If you look at Technica, you will see that there are two different crown gears.

3	One of them works well mated with an 8 tooth on parallel axles, and the other one doesn't.

3	The difference is only supposed to be longer teeth, so it really should not matter, but it does.

3	If your set works bad, try switching the crown gear to one of the other variety.

3	Worked for me.

3	-Toa Of Justice IMHO, 8829 is much better than 8296.

3	First, 8829 is a lot bigger.

3	I really like the huge rear balloon tires.

3	They both have rack and pinion steering, and they both have trailing arm rear suspension with a V-2 engine.

3	I think the body on 8829 is a little more well done.

3	For 8296, I think the alternate tractor model is much better.

3	For more comparisons, see Technicopedia.

3	:-) -Toa Of Justice

3	Hello All Apologize for digging out a such old post.

3	Recently I got a bag of Lego Technic parts where there have been mixed three sets: 8858, 8829 and 8235 The resurrection of 8858 has been described by me in a separate post.

3	Going back to the Dune Buggy – when I saw it for the first time back in 1994 I did not like it, as I was always big fan of 8840 (which I consider to the day the best looking Buggy) and set 8829 looked to me ugly.

3	So there were those all parts in the bag… then I though why not build it ?

3	And I started to do it.

3	When I finished I was very surprised how the final look of this set is!

3	Really taking my words back.

3	Unfortunately in the bag there were missing some parts and I could not rebuild the back spoiler.

3	So I made some changes to it and make it from spare parts that I have and it came out acceptable.

3	I also added some additional parts such as “fake” steering wheel, “Rally” logo, antennas.

3	I have also reverse mounting of the rear tires – why Lego did them like that I never know – as I think they look better this way.

3	Set: well the review has been already made by owner of this post so I will only add few things into it.

3	Engine – V2 (aired cooled?)

3	is driven by 4 gears -> from the single wheel (no differential as in 8840) using two old school z14 tooth bevel , then by z24 tooth crown and z8 tooth type 1.

3	Actually the (as in most old sets) the pistons are moving very fast (not as in current sets) and smooths – I needed to extra clean all engine parts as there was a lot friction.

3	Suspension – set has “engine bay” working using two old gray shock absorbers 6,5l – the movement is not big but works very nice, better then in 8840 in my opinion.

3	Steering – this is a bit odd as there is no direct connection to HoG as in most old sets, but first the gear rack is moved by z8 then two z14 tooth where reverse movement is taking place.

3	Later connection of two old school z14 tooth bevel goes to HoG Details – this is the most that I like in this set, specially how the use of axle pin connector perpendicular and 1x10 bricks with 3x3 cut corners and plate 1x5 toothed ends 2 studs with center axle hole are making the body shape – is just wonder.

3	Tires – the balloon rear are pretty nice the front is a new version of those that were in 8840.

3	What I do not like: 1.

3	Missing of Technic Figure (8840 had it.)

3	2. no steering wheel in the original set 3. no differential – but having in mind that Lego has introduce 24-12 teeth would be difficult to build the transmission in such small space where the engine is.

3	I will shortly upload new pictures and post them here later on .

3	Over all – I think it is worth buying it as it is very payable !

3	Actually very payable and runs smoothly , the steering, suspension – perfect Thank you and regards

2	Pictures of my restored set 8829 (I was almost 96% complete, and for missing parts I add of my own) The seat is black and not blue (as one was missing in my 8858) the spoiler is different, steering wheel added (not connected to wheels) and some additional items to make it look better) this is how I change the tire orientation The "new" rear spoiler: I still need to "clean" front rims Edited by AOW, 26 November 2015 - 12:32 PM.

3	WOW!

3	This buggy was my very first LEGO set.

3	I like this review - it remembered my childhood.

3	I also liked its body with those 8 studs long bricks on sides.

3	I can also remember trying to build engine in such way that it works smooth without success.

3	Anyway I think its "studless version" - set 8048 is much better.

3	Finally, after a very frustrating incident with the Internet Explorer 7's 'Back' button, I present to you my very first review.

3	This is a review of set 8158 Speed Racer Vs Snake Oiler, it's also the first review of a Speed Racer set on EuroBricks.

3	Also you should know that I didn't put the stickers on as they can be quite valuable later on down the road, so I'm sorry for the lack of stickers.

3	:-$ So without further ado I present to you my first review.

3	He He, that rhymes.

3	:-D EDIT: I just finished resizing the pics and uploading them to BrickShelf after having a heated argument about when my bedtime is with my mother.

3	So, I will be doing a complete redo of the picture portion of my review of set 8158.

3	I'm going to work on that as soon as I finish typing this message... EDIT 2: Review fully redone now, *sighs*, that took forever.

3	EDIT 3: Almost forgot to put in a new link to its BrickShelf folder.

3	This is V.2 of my review of set 8158, enjoy... Theme: Speed Racer Set:8158 Speed Racer Vs Snake Oiler Price: $19.99US Pieces: 242 Minifigs: 2 First off pics of the Box, Instructions, DSS, Minifigs, and New Parts: There are so many stickers they had to number them!

3	"Watchout it bites!

3	", Snake Oiler He's ready to take on SR, Hubcaps or no hubcaps!

3	>:-) Racin'!

3	Now for some comparison shots: Hope you all like V.2 better then V.1, I know I liked it better.

3	X-D Seriously though I even learned a thing or two doin' this last version.

3	;-) Now it's time for my summary: Overall a very well designed and executed set.

3	It's only downfalls are that there are way too many stickers, 32 to be exact, :-| and there are no cool contraptions on the cars to take out the other racer.

3	A great buy for $19.99, I reccomend this set to everybody because of the reasons I staed above and because even I, who is not a big fan of Speed Racer, X-O was drawn to this spectacular little set.

3	Price: 10/10 Pieces: 8/10 Too many stickers.

3	Minifigs: 9/10 Needed some accessories.

3	Playability: 8/10 Needs some cool contraptions on the cars to take out the other racer.

3	Overall: 35/40 General Tarful Edited by imperialshadows, 01 June 2008 - 12:07 PM.

3	Can't wait to get me one of those!

2	You're wrong.

2	Here it is: Look at the wheels (click).

2	General Tarful, please resize those pics.

2	I found all the April released Speed Racers sets in the shop in LEGOLAND.

2	I was going to post a review Tuesday of this set, but I can see I'm too late.

2	Now I cross my fingers for the Fierce Creatures set doesn't get "taken" as well.

2	I would like to comment on the review, but the pictures are too big - it simply takes too long to load.

2	Regarding that new resize function.

2	I can see it does "nearest neighbor" rescaling.

2	Doesn't it resize to less than 640x480?

2	I thought that was the standard for forum post pictures.

2	Thanks for the review, GeneralTarful.

2	I don´t know.

2	From some angles it looks good, and a little bad from some other.... 8-| Sticker mayhem, again, but very useful parts nevertheless.

2	Thanks for resizing the pics.

2	It is strange that you didn't know about that Z-piece before.

2	It was well used in old space sets.

2	The cars are pretty nice, but I think the people sit way too high in them - the windscreen gives almost no protection.

2	I am planning on modifying them to 7 studs wide since that's my current standard for this kind of race cars (Seriously!).

2	Looking forward to the next review.

3	As I said elsewhere I couldn't see this reviewed anywhere so here you are!

3	To start with, a couple of box shots: The contents and the parts laid out: The instructions: This is what was left over from the build: And here's the kit complete.

3	Build time, about ten seconds if you pick your nose whilst you are doing it.

3	:-D I love the little robot, it reminds me of that weird machine in the first Wallace and Gromit adventure, in fact, give it some skis and you are away.

3	Oh, and it has a metal detector thingy which I might have to borrow for a future episode of Grunts (I'm not sure if I have any already...who knows...) Cost - £2.49.

3	Value for money?

3	Erm, no, knock a quid off and I'd say yes.

2	Hi!

2	This is my forth pre-old-school review.

2	As promised: a yellow-set !

2	My 8862 arrived today, survived the washing machine coaster and actually was real fun to build!

2	#1: information: This set contains 664 parts (only!

2	I thought I’d be far more!)

2	and was released in 1989 in the TECHNIC theme.

2	Be sure to visit Technopediaif you want to know more!

2	#2: building instructions: Wow these instructions are used!

2	I'm not used to this after all this sets with unread instruction booklets...

2	The pneumatics page: The last step for the alternate model: #3: the parts: Wow!

2	Look at all those technic beams, gears, pins...!

2	#3: building: The left worm gear is for the outriggers, the right one for turning the “rear boom” The three 12L Axles: left one: outriggers, middle one: steering, right one: erm… rear-boom-rotation.

2	The two worm gears in the front part: left one: lifting the bucket, right one: dumping the bucket.

2	The turning-mechanism for the “rear-boom” is finished.

2	Once again a toothed 10L axle.

2	The Boat Weight 2x6x2 is hidden underneath the radiator grill.

2	Okay… many hoses and a nice, comfy seat have been added.

2	Now you can recognize the Backhoes real shape.

2	Only with a little violence it’s possible to lift the bonnet (?)

2	through the Pneumatic Pump.

2	Yeah, outriggers.

2	Same technique that the 8854 uses.

2	The finished “boom / jib / scoop thing” (=BJST) :-| X-D The finished loader bucket.

2	And to end the building process: the same picture from the introduction.

2	eins deux three quattro fem zes sédem osiem #6: final thoughts: Definitely worth buying!

2	As a child I thought it looks hideous - but today I’ve found out it’s totally fun to build and freaking functional.

2	Three things I want to mention though: The BJST can only be slewed (a new word!)

2	if the outriggers are deployed.

2	It is also possible that the BJST will reach the ground (danger of grinding or sticking) even if the outriggers are deployed.

2	The two mechanisms for the loader bucket can actually interlock, and the 14 tooth gears might break / disentangle from the axle.

2	thanks for viewing the pictures, I hope you enjoyed it!

2	Please comment if you want to!

3	Ah, what a very fine classic set.... and all these lovely Technic beams with studs!

3	*wub* Thank you very much for that excellent review, Bernd, and you did a fantastic job with all these great pictures!

3	:'-) *y*

3	Thanks for the review.

3	It looks beautiful.

3	My father was a backhoe driver, so understandably I used to drool over this set in the catalogs.

3	I never did get it though as Lego was so expensive in Australia then; I had around 2000 pieces and I thought I had loads!

3	:-D Anyway, last year I bought 8455, which I love; it works great with a compressor I made too!

3	*sweet* I wish mine had a real cab though... :'-( Do you have 8455 as well?

3	I'd love to see how they compare side by side...

3	It looks bigger than 8455 but I don't own any of the big old chuncky tires so I find it so hard to tell.

3	By the way, I have been reading all of your reviews but I have been a bit busy of late so I haven't had time to comment.

3	I hope you have more planned; any chance of a supercar one?

3	Another nice review.

3	The slow shutter speed pictures are great.

3	I think that was the only set with 8 distinct functions for a very long time and was only displaced by the 8455 Backhoe in that respect.

3	The turntable on the back doesn't turn very well though, as the weight is all distributed on one side.

3	The screw axle prevents it from popping off but there is still a lot of friction in it.

3	I don't have mine built anymore but it might be worth trying to put a weight brick or something on it.

3	Quote Do you have 8455 as well?

3	Yeah, it's quite a bit bigger.

3	When everything is fully extended, it becomes something like 26" long.

3	Although the 8455 actually has more/better functionality.

3	Edited by CP5670, 24 March 2008 - 08:15 AM.

3	Thanks for your feedback!

3	I like both, but I would say 8455 is far more than just a studless version!

3	with 10 pneumatic cylinders and 2 pneumatic pumps it's a wonderful set for every pneumatic freak.

3	Unfortunately I don't own the 8455 - YET.

3	;-) Sinner said: I hope you have more planned; any chance of a supercar one?

3	I foreshadowed a black review a few days ago... guess which one... X-O X-D

3	A great review for a great set!

3	It even had the old technic T-pieces and bevels, which I actually prefer to their modern counterparts.

3	I got mine for £20 in a second hand shop; it said complete, but one of the screw knuts was missing!

3	X-O So it's practically impossible to keep the back arm on with only one |-/ And they're rather rare on BL too |-/

2	yesterday while building, I accidentaly dropped a Axle Nut.

2	Of course I'm working in a total mess and so it tool some time 'til I found it again.

2	there are ~324 axle nuts on bricklink with an Avg Price of $0.89.

2	I didn't know of this Accessory-set: 5110-2... You can buy it for $40.00 8-?

1	BerndDasBrot, on Mar 24 2008, 05:08 PM, said: there are ~324 axle nuts on bricklink with an Avg Price of $0.89.

1	But I wants it cheap!

1	*sing* And I would still call 324 quite rare.

1	And I also want to just tack it onto another order.

1	*sad*

2	yeah, I meant they're rare.

2	;-) but I can imagine that a normal axle with the old half bushes will help.

2	Sometimes these are really strong; if you put 2-3 in a row?

2	EDIT: I just tried it: a normal 10L axle with 2 interlocking old half bushes type 1 on each end.

2	(I chose those who only can be moved very hardly along an axle.)

2	I slewed the BJST / back arm a few times tried the pneumatics parallel to it and it didn't loose.

2	I didn't know of this Accessory-set: 5110-2... You can buy it for $40.00 8-?

2	I was thinking of getting one of those off BL several years ago, back when the price used to be more like $15 or so, but I realized that I hardly ever use the couple that I already have.

2	:-P They came out with the modern turntable the year after this set, which mostly negated the need for these screw axles.

2	I think their only use now is to hold non-Lego objects onto models, like the Technic pen in 8094.

2	I guess you can try to make linear actuators out of them, but they're often too rare and fragile for that.

3	BerndDasBrot, on Mar 23 2008, 02:32 PM, said: Hi!

3	This is my forth pre-old-school review.

3	As promised: a yellow-set !

3	My 8862 arrived today, survived the washing machine coaster and actually was real fun to build!

3	The finished “boom / jib / scoop thing” (=BJST) :-| X-D thanks for viewing the pictures, I hope you enjoyed it!

3	Another great review and a wonderful set of pictures.

3	I like your nomenclature for the BJST.

3	Acronyms always sound nicely scientific; much better than "digger".

3	No one would know you made it up until they found out what it means.

3	I also really like what I will call your "kinetic photos".

3	They convey a sense of motion and show the range of the mechanism without the big file sizes of animations.

3	How long of a shutter speed did you use?

3	The secret to not getting too much friction in the turntable is using extra nuts and jamming them together.

3	You don't want to actually clamp the nuts tight across the turntable.

3	You want to jam two nuts tightly together at each end which prevents them from unwinding, but still leave a little free play (gap).

3	This way it will hold the assembly together but not prevent it from moving.

3	Mine moves quite easily.

3	This same concept is used on the pen plotter or 8094.

3	"Slewed"?

3	I think that's a word.

3	How about "slewn" or "slain" or "slewifacated"?

3	I think "rotated" is best.

3	*sweet* Eric

3	WOW thanks for putting up this thread, that reminded me that I own that one too.

3	*sweet* And I loved it as a kid.

3	By the way, don't forget to build the alternate model of 8862.

3	It is a combine (farm equipment) which is just as good as 8274.

3	I liked it so much that I bought two copies of this set so I could display both.

3	My favorite alternate model (not counting Universal Sets) is the 8480 submarine.

3	Maybe it is time for a white set review?

3	*skull* White is pretty rare.

3	For your blue set, I recommend you review 8462.

3	There are only a couple of green sets, and 8479 is the best.

3	And then of course, 8458 is silver!!

3	I think we all know what the best black set is.

3	And according to your photography, you have lots of them!

3	But don't forget 8868.

3	Eric

2	BerndDasBrot, on Mar 24 2008, 05:39 PM, said: could you explain your thoughts please?

2	You know: my english skills ;-) I was thinking you could somehow attach a 16-tooth dark gray gear (the one that spins freely around axles) to the nut, which would make the axle move in and out when the gear turned and convert the gear's rotary motion to linear motion in a fairly compact package.

2	Although there are other ways of doing the same thing that don't use such rare parts, and the 2008 Technic sets will come with pre-built linear actuators anyway.

2	Quote How long of a shutter speed did you use?

2	15 seconds.

2	Quote By the way, don't forget to build the alternate model of 8862.

2	I will review it too and post it in this topic!

2	Quote "Slewed"?

2	actually I took it from your site!

2	X-D Quote White is pretty rare.

2	unfortunately I don't own 8480 but I think 8824 is also a very good (though small) white set!

2	8462 rocks as a blue set.

2	I just got it a few weeks ago.

2	Let's see... 8462 also is one of the last TECHNIC sets I would call Old-school.

2	8479... okay too, but 8458 is IMHO not.

2	8868 and the totally mysteriously black set will follow...!

2	Did you had something like this in mind?

2	if the toothed 10L axle rotates the axle nuts want to rotate too but they can't because of that 2x4 Technic Plate.

2	So they'll decide to move along the axle.

2	The 1x6 Bricks on each end make sure that the axle won't move in or out.

2	Thanks for your feedback!

2	BerndDasBrot, on Mar 25 2008, 03:46 AM, said: 15 seconds.

2	Wow, that's a long exposure.

2	I would think you would get way too much light and overexpose the image.

2	The aperture must have been tiny.

2	Quote I will review it too and post it in this topic!

2	Cool.

2	I am also planning to write about the combine on Technicopedia.

2	That is unacceptable.

2	It is imperative that you put a mortgage on your house immediately to get it!

2	*sweet* Yes, 8824 is a good white set.

2	I also see from your room photos that you have the 8839 Supply Ship which has lots of white.

2	This is a really nice set.

2	8462 is hard to call old school, but at least it uses regular beams.

2	The air tanks are the best part of the set.

2	I wish LEGO had used them more often, especially on the highly pneumatic sets.

2	The tank makes all the difference on 8459.

2	You are right, 8458 is certainly not old school, but it is a great set with wonderful suspension.

2	It is of the same era as the Super Street Sensation with all of the panels for body contouring.

2	8868 is Technic at its best.

2	There is nothing else like it, especially with the compressor.

2	Thanks for your feedback!

2	While the assembly you have drawn would work as a linear actuator, I would not recommend it.

2	The torsional stiffness and strength of an axle are proportional to the polar moment of inertia, a section property.

2	Most of the stiffness comes from the outside of the cross shaped axle.

2	But in the threaded axle, you lose all the stiffness of the outer area because it is not continuous.

2	This means you only get stiffness and strength from the small core.

2	I think the threaded axle would bend and break very easily if subjected to much torque.

3	8479... okay too, but 8458 is IMHO not.

3	Yeah, the Tow Truck was the last set that still used mainly studded beams.

3	They made many changes to Technic the following year, with models becoming predominantly studless and making heavy use of the flexible axles/hoses and decorative panels.

3	The Technic logo and box art style was also changed a lot.

3	I really like the overall construction of that set.

3	The model is fairly lightweight but extremely sturdy.

3	It must be one of the strongest large sets they've released.

3	Quote Did you had something like this in mind?

3	That's basically the idea.

3	As Blakbird said though, it wouldn't be very powerful and would put the axle under some stress.

3	The linear actuators they're bringing out this year do the same thing and should work much better.

3	Some time ago I sort of complained about the fact that there was not much Technic represented in the Eurobricks community (this was the topic, if someone is interested).

3	I am glad to see someone took that complaint serious and started reviewing technic sets on large scale to show us how fascinating the theme really is!

3	This review is once again an excellent one, I really enjoyed reading it.

3	I must buy this set sometime soon because I always liked the three-way pneumatic system it came with and the overall look of the machine.

3	For many years it seemed out of reach, much to expensive and hard to come by as a kid.

3	Now as an adult there are many ways to acquire this wonderful set.

3	Keep on reviewing!

3	This is a review of Speed Racer set 8159 Raxer X Vs Taejo.

3	This is my second review and the first review of this paticular set and the only one on EuroBricks... at the moment X-D So without further ado I present to you my review... (I like that saying so much I decided to use it again in this review, it's originally from my review of 8158, which can be seen here.)

3	Note: Sorry that this review got delayed, but there was a hostile takeover of the computer, X-O don't worry everythings fine now.

3	X-D Set: 8159 Racer X Vs Taejo Theme: Speed Racer Price: $19.99US Pieces: 237 Minifigs: 2 Note 2: I did not take photos of just the new pieces this time because they're the same "new" pieces as in 8158, just in diff.

3	colors.

3	If you want to see a picture of them click here.

3	First off pictures of the Box, Instructions, DSS, and Minifigs: Not quite as many stickers as set 8158, but there still are quite a few.

3	Can you guess which ones which?

3	:-D Yes, Taejo's hair really is Red and Black, for Racer X's head TLG just reused the baddie's head from 7620.

3	|-/ Now onto the build: First Racer X's X Racer :-D (Thats not it's official name..

3	I think.)

3	:-$ Back end of the car.

3	The cockpit, and yeah there are no seats for Racer X's hiny, just a flat 2x2 Dark Bley plate.

3	The cockpit and rearend of the car connect using an S-shaped connector piece.

3	The front part of the car.

3	The fornt and the cockpit are also connected using an S-shaped connector piece.

3	Adding some details including Yellow fenders.

3	The underside of the car, so far.

3	Adding some more detail.

3	Newly added motor vents and smooth details.

3	Adding a front bumper, amongst other things.

3	Side view of the car, so far.

3	"No backseat driving, wait a minute, there's no backseat!"

3	The underside with newly added axles.

3	Demonstrating how hubcap piece is put on the car.

3	Now onto Taejo's GRR (Glorious Red Racer) :-P Front part of the car.

3	Cockpit, regular seats... check.

3	Cocpit and rearend of the car connected using S-shaped connector piece.

3	Adding some detail.

3	The front part of the car.

3	Front and cockpit connected also using the S-shaped connector piece.

3	Adding some fenders to the car.

3	Underside of the car, so far.

3	Adding some smooth details.

3	Taejos is the only car with an actual hood.

3	Side view of the car, so far.

3	Underside of the car with axels.

3	Now some finished shots of both cars: First Racer X's fine Black and Yellow racer Reminds me of an older Ferrari from this angle.

3	Up close and personal.

3	I'm guessing the 3 holes are exhaust outlets.

3	Racer X rollin'.

3	Now it's time for Taejo's Red racer "I could've sworn I ordered some hubcaps!"

3	-guess who... Taejo Racer X admiring Taejo's fine red automobile.

3	Up close with 'Big Red'.

3	Rearend shot of the car.

3	"I challenge you Racer X!"

3	-Taejo Racer X bein' a complete badass and smokin' Taejo.

3	>:-) Now for some comparison shots: (The Silver pocket knife is just to hold up Taejo's car.)

3	Now a shot of the extra pieces: Now if you combine 8158 with 8159, you get this: "Go, Go, Go!"

3	Now it's time for the summary: This set is an excellent buy at $20 dollars, it's well designed and has lot's of details, it also has very unique minifigs.

3	(Which are always good in a set.)

3	It's only downfalls are the lack of acessories for the minifigs and that there are no cool contraptions on the cars, and by "cool" I mean lethal to the other racer(s).

3	Now to the scoring of the set: Price:10/10 Pieces: 8/10 Too many stickers for such a small set.

3	Minifigs: 10/10 Unique and creative.

3	Playability: 9/10 Would have been perfect except for the lack of acessories and cool contraptions on the cars.

3	(But both are easily modified/fixed hence the nine.)

3	Overall: 37/40 A great set!

3	Bonus: Try and count how many times my Silver pocket knife appears and win... the knowledge of knowing how many times the Silver pocket knife appears.

3	:-P :-D This concludes the review, more pictures of either set 8158 or 8159 or both available through request, via PM-ing me.

3	*sweet* iamded, on Mar 24 2008, 01:32 AM, said: 29 times!

3	Great review, these are some sweet lookin' rides.

3	:-D Very similar to the other set, but still great.

3	*y* Thanks!

3	~Peace I counted only 28 times.

3	X-D Thanks Iamded, and yes they are very similar.

3	dragonator, on Mar 24 2008, 01:35 AM, said: Those are some beautiful cars, thanks so much for the review!

3	*sweet* Of the two, I like Taejo's one best, as red is my colour.

3	>:-) A perfect car for you and the bird to roll round in.

3	:-D I like the windscreen pieces, they're new right?

3	You're welcome Dragonator, and yes the winshield piece is new.

3	;-) On another note long live dragons!

3	Btw i don't know which one to get so could you reckomend me one?

3	thanks and great reveiw!

3	*y* Nope.

3	:-P And thanks Hollisbrick.

3	They are both really similar so it really depends on which colors you use more in MOC-ing, or which characters you like more.

3	My personal choice is 8159 as it has cooler minifigs, except for Racer X's recycled head :-|, and the colors are more useful to me.

3	Then again if you're like Batbrick the only thing that matters is if a set has Orange in it.

3	:-P whitefang_sg, on Mar 24 2008, 03:52 AM, said: Great review!

3	I personally do not like the stickers very much.

3	It's great that you show us the cars without stickers.

3	Hehe, it look nice!

3	Was thinking why other characters do not have a visor in front of their helmet Thanks Whitefang_sg, I don't put the stickers on because they can be very valuable latter on down the road.

3	Yeah me too, but in 8159 you get an extra black visor.

3	Ronan Nissen, on Mar 24 2008, 04:57 AM, said: Yeah, They're supposed to have see-through visors over their eyes like this: Can't wait for Speed Racer Lego!

3	When TLG makes a helmet like that, Hell will freeze over, we will finally get a proper open helmet Clone Pilot.

3	trooperdavinfelth, on Mar 24 2008, 06:50 AM, said: Curses!

3	You beat me to it.

3	:'-( Anyhow, I saw it 29 times as well.

3	I'm probably gonna get the truck and the Grand Prix.

3	Racer X was a letdown; I expected a kickass awesome unique head and all I get is Bruce Wayne rubbed in my face again.

3	*sing* (that is me screaming) Anyways, these sets look cooler and cooler!

3	More reviews!

3	I must see more!

3	*y* As I stated above I only counted it 28 times.

3	:-P Yeah at first I wasn't going to get any SR sets but when I saw them in person I could not resist, now I intend on collecting them all.

3	More will come as soon as I get more SR sets... darthperson8, on Mar 24 2008, 07:33 AM, said: Wow!

3	Not as cool as the other set but awesome nonetheless...I can see that red car being a sportscar for City.

3	And I hope that Bruce Wayne head does't become of liscened themes that the sunglasses face for City :-| Why is it not as cool as 8158?

3	*wacko* Yeah me too.

3	Asuka, on Mar 24 2008, 03:50 PM, said: A very good review, thanks GeneralTarful.

3	*y* That´s an interesting set for sure, and especially the red car looks really fine.

3	Air intakes, very nice.... :'-) You're welcome Asuka, and yeah the red car is fine.

3	Batbrick, on Mar 24 2008, 04:29 PM, said: Thanks for the review General Tarful!

3	I only saw the knife 27 times :'-( I like this set, but I probably won't justify the price, the other set has orange ( *wub*) and THE Mach 5, as well as better fleshie head I reckon.

3	To the Batbrick Cave!

3	>:-) You're welcome Batbrick, and wait untill you see set 8561 it has the Mach 6!

3	X-O Regards, General Tarful

3	Again, nice review!

3	LEGO should have used this for their helmets, you can put a (protecting)glasses(don't know the name) in front of it: Offcourse with a little 'M' printed on it.

2	GeneralTarful, on Mar 25 2008, 01:43 PM, said: Nope.

2	:-P Regards, General Tarful Thanks *y* probably will get this set although the orange..oh the orange peices 8-?

2	haha anyway once again thanks for the reveiw, and meditate on the decision i will *yoda* X-D

3	Nice!

3	It is probably the only Speed Racers set I will buy - and I will buy multiples!

3	Those cars look awesome.

2	Thanks for the review.

2	And for giving me directions :-P I think the design of these two cars looks to be better than in the other set.

2	The drivers are positioned lower compared to the windscreen and the design of the front on th red car is really nice.

2	I'm missing details of motors and cars this big could use a working steering mechanism.

2	Thanks for the review, mate.

2	I may get this as well, so I can get Racer X. Axctually, I see what TLC's done here, splitting up the two more well-known characters, Speed and Racer X, so you have to get both sets.

2	Matn, on Mar 25 2008, 08:09 AM, said: LEGO should have used this for their helmets, you can put a (protecting)glasses(don't know the name) in front of it: Visor?

2	I'd have to agree with you with regards the helmet.

2	I would've preferred this, especially for Speed.

2	Interestingly, my pocket knife is the same as that one.

2	I didn't count its appearances though.

3	Speaking of pocket knives, I just got Speed Racer and Snake Oiler at K-Mart and might mod the helmet so it actually looks like the cartoon.

3	The problem is - I don't want to shell out two bucks for a clear visor!

3	>:-( By the way, I know trans-clear visors are non-production, but where did they come from?

3	a pick-a-brick?

3	if so, what store?

3	Well at least if I do go through getting the elusive clear visor, it's not as bad as the insane $25+ red vader helmet!

3	This set is great.

3	I would have gotten this along with the one I purchased, but I didn't have enough dough with me to get both.

3	Crap, now I want these sets!!

3	Great review!

3	Very good review!

3	These sets are a lot better than I expected, and for $20, I might have to pick up both!

3	My family and I are going to Orlando this summer, hopefully I'll pick these and some other sets up at the Lego Store in Downtown Disney.

3	:-D

3	As promised, and with only a single day of delay is my review of the 2008 set: 4994 Creator Fierce Creatures.

3	This small set is the same size and price range as last year's 4939 Cool Cars reviewed by prateek and dillthepill.

3	The box General info You get 193 pieces (vs 206 for Cool Cars) which is quite a lot, but most of them are small.

3	There are a lot of hinges and some good slopes and wings.

3	The building instructions contains three models, but no further ideas for inspiration.

3	Primary model: Spider The first model is a big spider which shares some similarities to the secondary model of 4895 Power in the design.

3	The legs each have 3 joints, where the ones in the middle have "stud joints" to be moved sideways while the rest use hinges for all joints.

3	There are 8 of them and it does get a little tedious with all the repetitive building in this relatively small model.

3	I like the design of the face with a lot of eyes and a big and ugly mouth, but the real gem is the X-pattern on the opisthosoma made using double/inverted slopes.

3	It is poseable and I think it looks more "fierce" when inverted.

3	Secondary model: Snake The face of the snake is nicely detailed with a splitting tongue and a mouth than can move a little.

3	There is a problem with the construction.

3	It uses stacked hinges for some of the joints, which are hard to pull apart without stressing the pieces.

3	Tertiary model: Fly I'm not completely sure what this insect is.

3	I will say it's a fly, although the tail and head are too pointy.

3	This is a neat little thing.

3	Conclusion Primary model: 8 It is a good design, but lacks some sturdiness in the legs.

3	They fall off a little too easily.

3	Secondary models: 6 They are pretty good when you look at the bricks that are available, but they don't wow you in any way and they suffer from the same issues as the primary model regarding sturdiness.

3	Alternate models: 3 It is hard to come up with alternate models with so many small pieces and plates that are only 1 stud wide.

3	The colors might make you want to build a Spyrius space ship.

3	Playability: 8 The models have many movable joints and you can put quite a scare into your minifigs when their town gets attacked by these creatures... unless some EN forces are there to protect them.

3	Price: 6 Creator sets are known for their great price to bricks ratio, but this set doesn't quite measure up to sets like Cool Cars.

3	Pieces: 7 The pieces aren't great by themselves, but who doesn't need a fist full of hinges, slopes and basic plates in standard colors?

3	I don't think this is a must-have set like the big rig was last year.

3	The pieces are great and it has a nice primary model, but the set lacks a bit when it comes to the usual strong Creator qualities like alternate models and price.

3	Thanks for this review, it's a nice set with some cool pieces and nice techniques, I like the way the roof pieces are used to make the spiders back, for instance Lasse D, on Mar 26 2008, 09:48 PM, said: Alternate models: 3 It is hard to come up with alternate models with so many small pieces and plates that are only 1 stud wide.

3	Ouch!

3	That's not a good thing, let's refrain from that.... ;-)

3	A fine review of a fine set, thanks Lasse D!

3	*y*

3	Thank you for your detailed review, Lasse D!

3	*y* The only problem about this set is, that most of the people here will regard this as a pure parts pack.

3	X-D Oooh - I just found out about the red "teeth" - cool.

3	I want that!

3	Enchanted Island 6278 Pictorial Review Original price: $66 Pieces: 412 Figures: 7 This 1994 set marked the beginning of a new era for Lego Pirates - it became a theme more centralised around playability and not so much grand ol' ships.

3	6278 Enchanted Island was the flagship set of the Islanders subtheme, heavily based around Polynesian and Native American concepts (In fact, TLC was successfully sued by a number of tribes for using bastardised Maori names, such as Kahuka).

3	It was released as a Legend set in 2001, but due to poor sales was discontinued again.

3	The largest of the Islander sets, Enchanted Island is a portion of an island with a river running through.

3	The left hand side features some sturdy buildings built into a tree-like structure on a rocky outcrop, whilst the left hand side features a tower built out of "wooden" posts and a large tribal statue.

3	The box cover shows all the details; it does, however, differ from the instructions' finished product in that it has been more aesthetically arranged - bushes e.t.c.

3	have been moved to fill in gaps and to not obscure other things.

3	The sides of the box show nothing particularly special, although in one scene it depicts the Islander Canoe chasing the Pirate boat with the treasure; just one way to play with the set.

3	The back of the box, however, is superb, featuring a large number of alternative models: a toothy statue, a Pirate tree (think Wolfpack) with an Islander base, Kahuka's throne, a fire-breathing statue and a souped-up boat for the pirates.

3	These, and many more, can be easily made because of the large diversity of pieces.

3	The set has a huge number of minifigures for its size, the third highest number in the Pirate range (The SES and the BSB being first and second, respectively) - a whopping 7!

3	5 Islanders, including the all-too-common King Kahuka, the elusive Islander babe and 3 standard warriors - this set alone will never leave you short of enemies!

3	2 pirates, Ironhook in his standard attire with a scurvy dog at his side attack the island, although they are only moderately armed - 2 cutlasses and a pistol between them; a musket would've been nice.

3	The Islanders, on the other hand, have 4 shields, a bow and quiver and 6 spears, not to mention the big pokey thing with horns on top (Weapon?

3	Idol?

3	Staff?).

3	A monkey, parrot and crocodile provide the obvious creature features, with a fair amount of gold to finish off.

3	In the instructions, the goblet does not have the lid, although it does on the box; it's a nice touch anyway - adding a little more diversity to the monotonous treasure stashes.

3	The pirates' boat is a nice 2 sail vessel, with oars for when the wind stops and a treasure map.

3	The sails are similar to those in Lagoon Lockup, but with an extra front sail.

3	It's an awesome little boat, better for raids than a rowing boat, but not too big that it can't sail up rivers.

3	It can comfortably fit 2 men and, at a squeeze, 5.

3	The sails are expensive if you buy them seperately; normally this won't be a problem, but they can cost aroun $5 each.

3	The Islanders' boat is a canoe with a sail and an outrigger to stabilise it.

3	The sail is beautifully done, with 2 spars taughtening it.

3	There is a clip for the rower to leave his weapon when at se and the mast can turn to get as much wind as possible.

3	It's quite a top-heavy boat, but it doesn't look hideous and without the mast/sail it looks great.

3	3 Islanders can fit in it, and more if they sit on the outrigger.

3	The markings on the canoe are stickers, but they look fine and are probably more robust than markings for their job.

3	Furthermore, they're waterproof!

3	*sing* Kahuka's throne can be carried by 2 loyal subjects... ...Or strapped to his pet crocodile!

3	The clips on the side can be used to rest his weaponry, or hold spears for battle.

3	The throne looks nice, although I'm not too sure about the blue against the red - I'd have prefered white as it would clash less... An overview of the island; it is built in 2 halves - left then right and then joined together loosley, so it can be seperated for transporting.

3	Around the back to the left and right, there are large open spaces that are great for battles - this set isn't so much about a large solid build, but creating a "village" - smaller structures linked by bridges.

3	And the back... To the far left is a platform built onto the rock, with access from the river via a ladder.

3	There's the standard Islander drum with the lovely zebra-skin part (Where did they get that?!).

3	I've never understood the white flag - I was under the impression it was used for surrender... Further along the rocky bank, there are some hinged palm leaves that swing upwards to reveal...

3	...The treasure!

3	It's an OK hiding place; not the best place to hide it, right where the pirates sail past, but it feels fabulous; it fits right in.

3	Above it on the rocky bank is the main structure.

3	It looks very disjointed when you build it (bricks all over the place), but once it's done it looks nice and rural, with leaves everywhere and the "balcony" where Kahuka is standing.

3	You get a nice roof made from 2 large palm leaves tilting down.

3	Around the back there's a slight shelter, a table for picnics and a ladder to access the upstairs.

3	I was rather annoyed that it is so open, but the set is designed from just one perspective... To the left is the bridge to the other building... A nice, one piece bridge made of the softer plastic used for muskets and the post-1991 cutlasses.

3	It looks good, but be warned!

3	It tilts when you pull a pin, sending the pirates flying!

3	This contraption is a good idea, but it is very stiff and so doesn't swing, even when burdened by a minifigure - you'll want to modify this bit if you get it.

3	The other building looks like it is made out of posts and beams.

3	They are all red; brown would have been better, but it would have added too many colours to the range, just like the use of black for trees in some forestmen sets.

3	There are 3 clips for spare weapons; only 2 of these will ever be used when all the Islanders are armed, but it gives the pirates scope once they've been disarmed...There's another nice palm tree roof on top.

3	2 ladders give access...there's a total of 4 in this set - worth getting, eh?

3	Although they're 5p on Bricklink, for a KABOB, they're like gold!

3	At the top there's another hidey hole; the palm leaves lift up on hinges to show the treasure or hiding Islander.

3	It can be seen from behind, but this set is designed from one perspective only.

3	Nice cattlehorns too...alongside the slats you can see in the floor - 5 years later and it would've been a solid plate...

3	The big statue is one of the main selling point of this set, alongside the tilting bridge - they're the action features shown in every catalogue at the time, but it is not really special, just original.

3	The statue fits in with the theme perfectly - Kahuka's mask, his shield and this statue all depict the same deity, which is a nice "collectible" idea.

3	The back is rather plain, except the angled 1x1 bricks - a good touch.

3	I'm not sure why there's a black brick in the back of the head, but this is easily remedied; it could even be done with a brick from this same set, just swapping the two over... Aside from the head turning, the back can open to store sacred objects, or, in my opinion, prisoners, hence the gaps for breathing.

3	Either way, it's a lovely piece of architecture and deservedly a flagship element of the set.

3	There's your standard cooking pot floating around, although a 1x1 yellow stud as human flesh (remember, minifigs are yellow, no matter what the licensed themes say!)

3	is a superb finish.

3	This set is a stunning set for both kids and AFOLs who are just getting back into Lego/Pirates - it is a great army builder and, due to its release as a Legend, is extremely cheap on eBay - you should be able to pick one up for £18, or £15 if you're lucky.

3	For that you get a lifetime's supply of Islanders, 4 ladders, some wall panels, 2 baseplates (one raised and both with rivers and printed vegetation around the edge), a ton of weapons, a fair quantity of standard bricks, but most of all, a heap of vegetation: This is an easy to buy set, with normally around 5 on eBay at any time, and is well worth it, for the parts, the play and the nostalgia!

3	It can be easily modified; when used in conjunction with any other outpost, a much larger fortress can be made, especially if more rope bridges are used.

3	if you pick 2 of this fine set off eBay (It'll still be less than the original price!

3	), a huge complex can be constructed, giving you an instantaneous village for around £35.

3	thank you for review very good army builder i see

3	Excellent review!

3	*y* Getting a better chance to look at this set actually makes me interested in it.

3	I was in my dark ages throughout the Islander days, though I have built up a small force of them (10?)

3	from eBay buys, but no actual sets.

3	If this is really as reasonable as you say there, I may just have to pick one up soon.

3	Oddly, I do own the baseplates to this set, having also picked them up in a lot on eBay, so I might be able to recreate it manually, but I think I'd rather pick one up whole.

3	It looks like a great mix of parts and makes a decent looking display piece.

3	Thanks again for the fine review!

3	*y*

3	Thanks for a lovely review!

3	I only recently bought this set off Ebay (pretty good deal: MISB for 30 euro's!)

3	and I enjoyed putting it together and mixing it with the other Piratesets.

3	When you put two sets of two baseplates together you'll get a large pond with an island in the center, just to achieve that I bought two more baseplates off Ebay.

3	The result is this MOC.

3	I always loved the Islanders and have most of the sets, not all of them but that is going to change in the future.

3	*y*

3	Excellent review!

3	I really like this set and so I gave it a 5/5.

3	This set is on my list to get.

3	I especially like the speedy pirate boat, and the also very fast outrigger canoe with a sail.

3	I don't think a small number of these cannibals will make much of an impact on gaming though, even if they get a bonus with spears.

3	Duke

3	A mighty fine review you've created SlyOwl!

3	*y* After some sleep I shall immerse myself more fully within it.

3	Nice review ( although I'm pretty sure Eldorado Fortress has 8 minifigs, making this set no 4 in the minifig count.)

3	I gave it a 5.

3	The number of islanders and vegetation pieces comes in very handy for land based scenarios.

3	I've got 3 copies of this set, 1 of them costing me less than 2Euro's from an ebay auction in Scotland.

3	Along with Forbidden Island it's easily one of the most common and affordable pirate sets to be found on he second hand market.

3	A great and informative review with very fine pictures, thanks SlyOwl!

3	*sweet* A wonderful set this is indeed, full of nice details and pretty playable, and a cool subtheme that offers a lot of fantasy and charming characters in a marvelous layout.

3	I really love that little boat with the outrigger, and the neat buildings and sweet landscaping works together very well.

3	TLC got sued for using some names of native sounding origin?

3	Now that sounds really strange to me.... such names´re widely spread within novels, movies and such stuff, I didn´t know that there´s some kind of copyright on them.... 8-|

3	Good review, mr. SlyOwl!

3	And good pics too!

3	I know it probably deserves better but I only give him a 3.

3	I'll be surely the only saying that I don't like this set but I remember I had it for christmas when I was a child and it disappointed me very much because I expected it much larger after seeing it in the LEGO catalogs.

3	Well it's just a little trauma I had :-P LOL Anyway I must admit it's an interesant set, specially because of the large number of mini-figures and accesories it brings with and the two little "ships" Edited by BlueBard, 31 March 2008 - 01:13 AM.

3	Excellent review of an outstanding set!

3	I love the main image.

3	I want this set so bad!

3	Yay!

3	Pictures!

3	Thank you for the review.

3	You made me actually consider looking it up on ebay, but I already have so so many things to get on my want list.

3	Drat my easy ability to get sold on something lego!

3	It's a great set and one I have yet to add to my collection despite my large number of Islander extras.

3	Enchanted Island, aside from having so alluring a name was good value for money in that you only needed this one set and you had a good representation of the islanders both in the size of the set and the number of minifigs.

3	The flipping rope bridge and the river give it a great rainforest retreat sort of feeling and one is inclined to think of this set as more inland than directly coastal for me.

3	Whilst the Islanders were never seen in the same light or popularity as Pirates and Imperials they were an obvious and colourful addition that to me added a whole new depth to the Pirate system and one was now able to play a 3 or 4 way war adding a greater political element to the sets.

3	Enchanted Island is probably the 3rd most appealing of the large land bases for me after Port Royal and Eldorado Fortress.

3	Good review and glad to see the set recognised!

3	SlyOwl, you're a legend!

3	Thank you for taking the time to do such a comprehensive review.

3	You've captured Enchanted Island in impeccable detail and anyone who doesn't own this set should know it inside-out by now.

3	I shall write my thoughts on the set itself, directly.

3	For some reason I never considered buying this set.

3	But your review changed that.

3	I'll try to get it on eBay.

3	Thanks for your efforts to make this wonderful review for us.

3	It's now added to our index.

3	Wow, that is one great review you made Sly!

3	I gave it a four, only thing i don't like is the raised baseplate.

3	It does get you a lot of figs, two ships and some nice assecories, great set!

3	Great review!

3	I think this set looks great.

3	I really like the islanders and that statue is really nice.

3	It comes with a lot of nice leaves and I like all of the secret compartments and the like.

3	Thanks for the nice review!

3	Thanks for the review!

3	I am getting very interested in the classic pirates sets, and I wat some now.

3	This seems like it would be a great starter.

3	I was just going into my dark ages when LEGO began the Islander themes, so I've never really cared for them.

3	BUT this review actually made me want this set real bad.

3	I guess this is what reviews are for then - good job on the review

3	Great review!

3	I recently got this set for only 150 SEK, around $17, and it´s really good!

2	Everytime I saw this at a toy store I always cried to my parents for one, but never got it, I got the smaller islander sets, but the more I see this now, I don't want it, I could buy it, but naahh, I am hoping Lego does an updated version of the islanders with this new pirates line, one can hope right!!

2	Hello Eldiano.

2	Although the review is fine and you have memories related to that set please have in mind that the post you were replying to was in fact some 7 years old.

2	This is what we call "bumping of old topics" and it shouldn't be done.

2	You might want to take a look at our FAQ: Posting tips and etiquette Edited by Phred, 06 April 2015 - 03:47 AM.

2	by Phred: Read next post please.

3	Eldiano, thank you for posting about your desire to have this set.

3	I do own the set, and I do recommend it to others if they somehow find a used one.

3	The bricks are kind of sparse, but the the bricks it does come with are really nice, I love the figs, and the base plates are by far my favorite made by TLG.

3	Captain Braunsfeld, I suggest that you read through the link that covers topic bumping more clearly.

3	I apologize for the confusion Eldiano.

3	I do believe that I have found a way to remove the confusion of posting in old topics soon among the Pirate Staff and to the other members of EB, please stay tuned.

3	Sinner, on 18 July 2010 - 03:16 AM, said: 3.

3	LEGO reviews don't date.

3	Thus if you have something relevant to say then feel free to post in a topic, but if it's more than a few months old please make sure it's good.... and if it's been a few years it better be really good!

3	For example, if you liked the review or set and want to say so you probably shouldn't.

3	If you've got an answer to a question (such as "Does anyone have pictures of the alternate model?)

3	then by all means post!

3	What you shouldn't do is ask questions to the original poster; he/she may not even visit EB any more.

3	Fortunately I got this set on 2000 (not the released version, the original one).

3	And I said "fortunately" because it's a lovely set.

3	How could I rate it, but awesome?

3	A little Islander "army", the islander girl, Ironhook and that cool boat with two sails, the jail-polynesian statue.

3	I must recognize that I have a thing with the Islanders.

3	I know that they are weird, poorly based on the polynesian aborigens, etc.

3	But they are very original, broke with the traditional enemies, and gave to the Pirates theme an exotic and wild look.

1	I realized that building the chess set from the new pirates theme, they are two grey heads that reminded me of the king kahuna throne, which goes to say that I am hoping they bring back new sets, I just wish they were bigger.

1	I would love to build the old ones, but I would side more towards the newer model if they ever released them.

3	What an amazing (old) set!

3	I loved Pirates in my childhood, but that was before the Islander and Spanish stuff... mine were the BSB and soldier fortress with the big baseplate.

3	As I'm now returning to Pirates, I've tracked down most of the 2009 sets and of course bought the new 2015 sets... but knowing I missed this "middle" period of Islanders vs Pirates makes me a bit sad... those Islanders are soooo "Monkey Island" (those of my age likely feel the same) to my eyes!

3	Oh for a "Lemonhead" minfig... ;) I'm curious now how much this set sells for, given it was apparently one of very few Lego actually re-released!

3	I recently bought a MISB BSB that was an early 2000's re-release, and it was very pricey... but then, I suspect the BSB has a LOT more of a nostalgic following these days than this set!

3	Can anyone give me a rough idea what this set goes for in as-new condition these days?

3	Regardless, a fantastic review with some great photos of the whole set and minifigs... even though this is an old thread, I am glad someone else bumped it recently so I can add my thoughts too.

3	:) One thing I've noticed comparing the newest Pirates sets to the 80's ones I had as a kid (and these from the 90's) is the move away from baseplates and big "panel" pieces.

3	I actually like that in a lot of ways; whilst I miss baseplates being included as they are a great starting point for creating new things (and make the sets easier to "play" with), visually, I think Lego-designed model sets look better without them.

2	here is a preview of my review of speed racer: Grand Prix Race i will try to get a full review up later today pics (when public) sorry about the blur, i am not a great photographer.

2	also if, there are any pictures you would like (that i haven't included), just ask

1	Judging from your pictures there seems to be many interesting torsos and new fleshy heads but I don't think this set is for me.

1	Fueling my dismissal of this set is that i saw the trailer for this film at the cinema today and it looked pretty terrible!

1	:-X Thanks for taking your time to review this set though ricecracker!

1	;-) Edited by casewindu, 29 March 2008 - 10:18 PM.

3	No problem Casewindu!

3	i actually like this set for the pieces and torsos (especially Sprittle's)

1	How comes the monkey stays yellow but not the people... :'-(

1	Joey Lock, on Mar 29 2008, 07:13 PM, said: How comes the monkey stays yellow but not the people... :'-( It's a liscensed theme, so they are tan.

1	;-) They are still good sets even though the movie might be crap :-| geez it's not like we buy SWL because the movie is good X-D anyway thanks for myour time rice cracker!

3	I will most likely get all the speed racer sets as it was one of my favorite movies(the animated one) i just loved the decked up and tricked out cars >:-) great review and red tux = X-D

3	Looks like a great ole set to me.

3	The cars seem abit overly slopey to me though, I'll probably pass on this.

3	But as a note, I especially like the black and yellow car's horizontal wheel covering things.

3	Nice :-$

3	again, no problem!

3	personally i would have liked a lower price ($96.04 CAD with tax *n* ) also my favourite would be the gray and black car!

3	Thank you for the pics *y* I want a Trixie impulse set *wub* And otherwise that little boy with his monkey.

3	I like the print on his t shirt.

1	doubt ill get this, i used to like the anime but the the film looks cheesy as a cheese sandwhich

2	Sorry to bump such an old thread, but I´ve just discovered this set is on sale at Amazon.de - for a mere 25 Euros.

2	I am tempted.

2	Not because I like the set or the models, but because of the parts.

2	As most of you might know, I´m especially into Exo-Force.

2	So would you recommend to get this set just for the parts?

2	Are they a good choice to combine with EF-sets?

2	Would anyone of you be interested in obtaining the fleshie-parts of the minifigs from me, as I totally don´t need those?

3	I picked up this set a few weeks ago (along with the smaller sets that come with the Mach 5 and Racer X's car), and I was pleasantly surprised.

3	The commentator's stand is nothing to write home about, but the assortment of figs is great (numerous new face prints in flesh, I believe), and in spite of the large amount of stickers, the three cars are each unique and very well-designed.

3	My only gripe about them is that Cannonball Taylor's car (the black and yellow one) was a missed opportunity, as in the movie it's yellow and purple.

3	I know TLC is dropping purple for the future and had a bunch of problems with it in the past, but it would have made for a great looking car IMO.

2	Well......

2	Thanks for your posting, but I couldn´t care less about fleshie minifigs or movie-accurate cars - or the cars at all.

2	This set would really ONLY go into my parts bin.

2	Therefore I need to know what parts are in there and if they are "cool" enough to go into an Exo-Force collectors parts bin.

2	An opportunity has come up to buy this set for 100 AUD.

2	Just wondering whether people think it's worth buying?

2	I've heard very little about the speed racer Legos

1	Welcome to EB.

1	I don't know what you're trying to say here but it isn't a good reason to bump this thread either.

1	So don't.

3	Hi!

3	I've promised a lot lately.

3	I'll review 8868, 8880, Space Police II, Blacktron II... And I WILL.

3	It's just the time that is blocking me.

3	And my university.

3	And the fact that I just picked up 8460 in original box for only EUR 36,50...!

3	*sweet* The other reviews will follow - please bear with me.

3	And this set review is also a gift to this nice fellow who gave me the title!

3	That's what I'm talking about: #1 useless information with high numbers: This set contains 841 parts and was released in 1995 in the TECHNIC / Tech Build / Advanced (sub-) theme.

3	The bricklink price guide displays for “Used” a Qty Avg Price of $125.85 and for “New” a Qty Avg Price of $212.82.

3	I got it for $56,98.

3	Still can’t believe it.

3	:'-) This set was rereleased two times (8431 in 2002 and 8438 in 2003).

3	#2 the box: Front: Back: Open: The box is higher than other Technic boxes.

3	Why?

3	I don’t know.

3	8460 doesn’t have any real large parts.

3	Whatever.

3	Inlay: I wonder why TLG doesn’t make inlays anymore… They’re noisy and brake easily but are great for (pre-) sorting.

3	#3 building instructions: I will quote myself from the 8862 review: Quote Wow these instructions are used!

3	I'm not used to this after all this sets with unread instruction booklets... Triple-wow!

3	‘nuff said.

3	This is the “first” page.

3	(Fortunately Peeron offers scans!)

3	The last step for the alternate model and a few nice photos showing how the pneumatic pump will be erm- pumped.

3	Yeah.

3	Random page: I forgot the overall thoughts to the instructions: These are Technic instructions as we’re used to them: part count, easy to understand (okay, the string part at the end was too much for me) and the color distinction is okay too.

3	100 pages long and if I can trust my eyes the pneumatics page can be fold out.

3	(I don’t have this page but I assume it.)

3	#4 the parts: #5 building: An easy and fun build.

3	Okay, this could take some time.

3	My longest building review up to date.

3	The front steering: The rear steering.

3	The axle pin between the rear steering is for the axle which rotates the crane.

3	The two worm screws in the front are for the outriggers (they’re not linked.

3	One for each side.)

3	The small wheel in the back is for the rotation.

3	Adjusting front and rear steering.

3	outriggers are finished.

3	You can notice a 8 tooth gear that will rotate the Technic Turntable.

3	A steering wheel has been added.

3	Could be the same stickers like the alternate 8880 used to have.

3	The steering can be operated with both actinic lights (?)

3	No.

3	We’re far from finished.

3	I’ve got a lot of parts left at this point.

3	Wow.

3	A 4x4 corner plate!

3	Pneumatics and a winch: If you can’t recognize it on the photo: The Technic Beams are the erm- wrong/other side up.

3	The 1x6 Technic Beams on the left side are normal.

3	The axle that will extend the crane: 7 gear racks 1x4 the 1x6 Technic plate will keep the two pneumatic cylinders straight.

3	*sad* 8-| Huh?

3	Did you blink?

3	You missed a special part: The whole rotatable thing will be attached to the Technic turntable using two long Technic pins.

3	The pin on the right side should be in the middle of the three “turntable holes”.

3	On the right side, it’s the first hole.

3	Asymmetric!

3	Why?

3	Because we’ll add a cute cab!

3	#6 functionality: You can find the features in comparison to other Technic cranes here.

3	Technopedia, of course.

3	I made one "sentence" out of it: (please don’t find any mistakes.)

3	:-P “two axle rack and pinion steering, pneumatic luffing and gear driven telescoping via crank for the boom which can slew 360° on turntable driven via gear, crank driven hoist and gear driven outriggers at four corners which snap over center.” #7 random shots: Comparison to 8854: uuuh… once again a depth of field.

3	I tried to make it look authoritarian like 8858 but I failed.

3	Somehow 8460 looks cute.

3	#8 comparison to 8421 Mobile Crane / Crane Truck: I feel that a question concerning this will be asked, so I deal with it right now.

3	First of all: I don’t own 8421 yet.

3	I know.

3	A Technic freak really should own it.

3	Anyway: 8421 has more than twice as much parts as 8460, is motorized, features a V6-engine and a very neat mechanism to extend the crane/boom twice using a braided string with end studs.

3	Try to find out how!

3	Of course 8421 features (far) more than 8460.

3	IMHO 8421 should have been a copy of 8460, a set so successful that it has been rereleased two times, but the designers overshoot the mark.

3	8421 is a (breathtaking) monster.

3	Compared to it, 8460 looks cute - not pale!

3	#9 final thoughts: I got it on eBay in kind of good condition, for about 50 dollars.

3	I know that it has been worth the money in any point of view.

3	*wub* I didn’t use the word “old-school” for now.

3	I’ll change that: 8460 belongs to the favored few of old-school Technic sets!

3	thanks for reading and viewing the pictures, I hope you enjoyed it!

3	Please comment if you want to!

3	Ah, thanks sommuch again for that great review!

3	*y* *sweet* Man, I am so happy they made this set.

3	The new one seems too boring.

3	;-)

3	Somehow I competely missed your review when you first made it, I saw your pics on brickshelf and wondered about the review... You have managed to review my all time favourite technic set!

3	It was the first large Technic set I was given by my parents, when it first came out in 1995.

3	I played for hours with this set, making minifig seats in it (it was so huge there was room for four minifigs to sit next to eachother in front....) I made various applications for it, a bungee-jump system with a large rubber band, and lots of containers to be lifted.

3	The first changes I made included the inverting of the wheels and the disabling of one of the flashlight-steering wheels because they obstructed eachother.

3	By the way, the nob for your winch is yellow instead of black (I know this set by heart, so watch out :-P ).

3	I always liked those nobs.

3	I do own the 8421 and I can tell you: this 8460 is much, much stronger, it can carry more weight because the boom is lighter then the 8421: they are powered by the same two pistons... You know when you made it right: when the crane is in upright position, fully extended and you release the brake from the winch.

3	Does the hook lower without having to pull it?

3	If it does, you succeeded in constructing the set right.

3	The alternate model was great fun too, the pump is cleverly hidden and the crane folds up great between the cab and the loading platform.

3	You could easily mod it with a pneumatic claw on the crane, a motor to turn it and a compressor.

3	The only flaw was the loading platform which had no floor (only some axles).

3	Thanks so much for reviving my memorie concerning this great set!

3	*y*

2	I'm in the same situation as you; I have this set but missed out on the newer 8421.

2	This was a great set for its time but the 8421 definitely looks better to me.

2	I've been trying to find a good deal on it on ebay but it's pretty expensive, considering that it only went out of production last year.

2	Quote Inlay: I wonder why TLG doesn’t make inlays anymore… They’re noisy and brake easily but are great for (pre-) sorting.

2	The box designs in general are crappier these days than they used to be 10 years ago.

2	You don't see the old "featured parts" trays anymore and the boxes don't have the different sections either (these also acted as internal supports for larger boxes, so they were less prone to being crushed).

2	The cardboard material is also quite a bit thinner.

2	I think it's a result of TLC's overall cost-cutting moves since then.

2	Most people toss the boxes and probably don't care, but I keep all of them.

2	There was actually a time when the boxes used to be even stronger.

2	I have an old 8859 set and the outer box is made of a hard, styrofoam material, although they probably stopped using that for environmental reasons.

2	Edited by CP5670, 06 April 2008 - 10:13 PM.

3	A great review, thank you.

3	I do not know these old sets like this one, but it is very cool to see how they were made.

3	I have an un-opened 8421, maybe I should do a small review of that when I get to build it.

3	btw.

3	boxes are expensive, so at a given price point, it's a choise between more bricks or nicer boxes.

3	I have no doubt what most people would chose.

3	I got more than hundred boxes... and my 8848 box came with styrofoam too!

3	Thanks for the review.

3	*sweet* For it's size and parts count this is a remarkably featured set.

3	I don't think I've never seen the alternate model before.

3	Personally I prefer 8421 because I think it looks much better and I love the six wheel steering.

3	I also love the three segment boom and the transmission; they fit it all in so neatly.

3	I realise that it has trouble even holding up itself, but ultimately it doesn't matter as it's not like you are really going to construction work with it.

3	What bothers me more about 8421 is the design change in the boom from chainlinks to strings.

3	I would try to mod mine but all I have is the prototype picture to base it on... and I don't have enough links anyway!

3	Yes, that really sucks.

3	Somebody (I haven't got the time to look :-$) on Brickshelf has made a quite good alternate.

3	Lego have been a bit inconsistant with alternate models lately.

3	The recent tow truck had a good one; I even made both!

3	Great review!

3	While I admit I wasn't into Technic at the time this came out (I was a mere child, give me a break!

3	:-D), I can see now why it was featured so much.

3	From the booklets to display stands at toy stores and at my local LEGO center (when it was still around), this thing was everywhere!

3	With your review, I can now truly appreciate all the details of the set.

3	I got to admit, I can see the appeal now!

3	That comparison shot you took is amazing.

3	I love not only just how it included the little details such as the stabilizers, but also looks incredibly fun to play around with.

3	Great set and an even greater review!

2	thanks guys!

2	@ sinner: i hope you refered to 8285 so my answer will match: 8285 is interesting: main model: american styled truck, alternate model: european styled truck.

2	I don't think TLG produced many european styled truck.

2	EDIT: I just found a wonderful MOC-alternate on brickshelf: 8436 by industrialdesigner.

2	If I got him right, he designed a few offical technic sets for TLG.

2	@ all: promises, promises, promises... hm.

2	[BUMP] Serge9591 made a STUDLESS adaptation (version) of the 8460 Lego Technic Pneumatic Crane Truck for a SeTechnic contest, and posted this YouTube video:

2	Set ref: 7624 Name: Jungle Duel Number of minifigs: 3 Number of pieces: 78 Price: 11,90€ It’s the smaller set from the last Indy movie, “the kingdom of the crystal skull”.

2	Here we go!

2	A general view of the set: We have a tent, some food ( a chicken leg is always welcome!

2	), a fireplace, the things with all the swords, a bench with a broken table, 3 ants, a map (printed tile) and other accessories.

2	Don’t make that girl hungry or... YYYYAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!

2	Ho no!

2	Our diner, a giant ant, has gone away!

2	Those giant ants are made in a smooth plastic, in dark red and trans black colour: And here a closer view on the two new hairpieces: The new girl hairpiece is really cute, and I’m a bit disappointed by the new man hairpiece…Those hair lake some volume… But I’m really happy to see that TLC has made some new moulds for hairpieces!

2	It’s the good part of the theatre lines!

2	So, it’s a really interesting set because you’ve got a lot of useful pieces for a city Mocers, with the two new hairpieces without spending a lot of money!

3	I really need another tent (i can later use it for rebel troopers), and I love the selection of minifigs.

3	The new spiders are freakin' awesome.

3	Why didn't Lego make them before This set is a must buy for me (I guess in the UK it will be £8.99) EDIT: Where did you get this set alex54?

3	I really want to know!

3	Edited by The Rancor, 15 April 2008 - 09:13 PM.

3	Actually they are ants.

3	Spiders have 8 legs while ants have only 6 like these.

3	The two thing that look like legs in the front are the antennae.

3	Back on topic, I think this set looks great and I can't wait until I can get my hands on it and the other new IJ sets.

3	I thought they were spiders before, but when I saw them mentioned as ants, I realised that they are definately ants!

3	Being a big ant fan, I recognise that they are not spiders - they look like ants too, and they could be lifesize to some larger species.

3	Yay ants!

3	And new hairpieces!

3	And accessories!

3	Anger the Woman in charge and thou shall have no dinner.

3	Great review, the sets looks good, and the retunr of the tent is something to be very happy about.

3	And also, those giant camp-attacking ants look really great, they can be use as bugs in a ToD spike and bug room diorama.

1	The new Man hair looks like a Wig!

3	A neat little set.

3	Thanks for this review alex54, this looks like a great set.

3	I love the new hair molds and faces, plus al those extra pieces are fantastic!

3	Batbrick Away!

3	Can't wait to get this one (ANTS!!!)

3	I don't have a tent either, so that'll be a great pickup.

3	I'm surprised, though, that it includes the gold Exo-Force sword.

3	I didn't expect this to come in any other sets besides the tower.

3	<Faramir-<

3	Thanks for the review!

2	I have no idea why they dont use that female hair piece on Trixie in Speed Racer.

2	It would be PERFECT!

2	Greta Review!

3	Another great review Alex.

3	Is that the same tent/construction as the tent in 5978, Sphinx Secret Surprise?

3	I'd buy a bunch of these just for the ants to make an ant farm!

3	I also like the bowl cut.

3	I love this set!

3	Or not.

3	There are six legs, 2 antennae, and 2 mandible.

3	And they most definately are ants, to those still in doubt.

3	Thanks for this great review, Alex, this is most definately (well, in my opinion anyway) the best set.

3	Lets face it, in motorcycle chase you really only got 2 bikes and 2 crates as the big parts of the set.

3	In this one, which is the same price, you get those ants, a neat tent (Hurray!

3	), a [b]printed[/i] map, a chicken leg, a Castle sword, EF sword, and Pirates sword, a dagger (now in light bley) and a silver frying pan.

3	This set is packed with useful pieces, I'm definately getting this one.

3	And I for one love Mutt's hair piece.

3	I sense my sig-fig will soon have a new hair style.

3	Thanks again Alex for the sweet review!

3	~Peace Edited by iamded, 16 April 2008 - 05:07 AM.

3	Thanks for the excellent review Alex!

3	This is so far my favorite Crystal skull set (released) the cargo plane is however the best I love the small accessories like turkey leg, banana, golden sword and GIANT ants!

3	Mutt's torso is very nice!

3	I love the leather jacket print Irina is just a another Hottie, but I would like to see her smile Oh and another Indy...........

3	I was already thinking of buying this set, and you've totally convinced me.

3	Thanks for the review, Alex Btw, I think they are ants, having that shape; moreover, we already have spider molds, and they have already been used in Theatre themes (see Spiderman ).

3	LuxorV

3	OK!

3	I think, it''s a no-brainer that this is a must-have for pretty much anyone who likes LEGO!

3	It's cheap and a great minifigs & parts pack!

3	I'll be getting at least 1 of these!

3	Here is what I like about it: 1.

3	Great minifigs with nice torsos, sweet faces, and awesome hair!

3	(Gotta ask 'em where they get it done! )

3	2.

3	Golden katana!

3	3.

3	Chicken leg!

3	YUM!

3	4.

3	Nice campfire!

3	And this is what I don't like about it: 1.

3	Dark bley knife!

3	Seriously, they could have at least made it silver like the sword, if not chrome!

3	2.

3	Rehashed tent.

3	3.

3	Spiders with 6 legs!!!

3	I actually don't really care about the tent and the multi-legged creatures.

3	Those go straight into the sorting boxes.

3	Perhaps I might use the tent someday for a steampunk MOC of some kind, or a stop-motion film, or maybe some kind of contest...

3	Anyway, what's up with that thing that holds the katana, the sword, and the saber?

3	It's in the airplane set too!

3	Is it perhaps one of the treasures of the new movie or is it something Indy takes with him everywhere in this film?

3	44However, nice pics, nice review!

3	Thanks, dude!

3	Edited by Oky Wan Kenobi, 16 April 2008 - 09:38 AM.

3	Mhm...I really need this set!

3	There are various things I’m interested in: the minifigs (hey, I still have no Indiana Jones figs!

3	), the new hairpieces, a gold katana, a dark bley pirate cutlass (is this the first one?

3	), a dark bley knife (could be useful..), those giant ants, yet another silver broad sword (you never have enough of those).....great parts pack indeed.

3	Shakar

3	Great review; I will definitely get this, if not only for the hair but the ants, melee weapons, and new faces and torsos!

3	Great review

3	nice review indeed thanks for review all these new indianna sets just wondering did your set have a crate as im sure the prims has a crat with a banana in.

3	I simply that tent!

3	I guess I´ll have to buy three of these just to make a proper expedition MOC somewhen.... A great little set indeed, with marvelous new MF torsos and that new black feminine hairpiece´s also great and very useable for creating some characters related to the sixties and seventies.

3	And finally a pan that´s not black and a knife in grey.

3	That´s very handy indeed, the chrome one always looked a bit too shiny to me....

3	Thanks for that sweet review, alex!

3	Thanks for that great review!

3	This is a very interesting set filled with nice parts for customisation.

3	Somemore, the price is not that steep.

3	I will need to get ready for the second wave!

3	Set ref: 7625 Name: River Chase Number of minifigs: 4 Number of pieces: unknown Price: 22,90€ A general view of the set: We’ve got an amphibious vehicle, a small boat, an observation post and a dark green croco (so beautiful!

3	).

3	For the figs, we’ve got Indy of course, Marion and two Russian soldiers, nothing special here.

3	In the back of the tree, there is a box, to put some things: The amphibious vehicle is very nice!

3	The proportions are really great (not too big, not too small) and there are a lot of details everywhere, like the propeller: A back view: An inside view: The small boat is a dark grey Zodiac, but the details are nice too, giving it a retro look, in the same way of all the Indy vehicles: The outpost has a net to permit to the bad guys to capture some nice guys and girls… But it seems that the girl Marion is scared of the nice croco!

3	So Indy comes and help her pushing the Technic axle with this round inversed tiles, which push out the net and capture the croco.

3	Now Marion feels happier!

3	And she takes a can of oil and whacks the poor croco, without defences!

3	Who has said Marion is a nice girl?

3	So, I’ve bought this set like an add on to my city.

3	In fact, the elements of this set can easily be integrated in a town layout.

3	I plan to use the outpost for my forest section, and the amphibious vehicle is always a nice touch of originality in a layout.

3	Yes you can use all those military things without creating an army in a layout: just put the violent parts out, and you’ve got nice things, like a biologist car in the case of the amphibious vehicle!

3	Great set, i'll definitely get it.

3	Is there any sign of flesh on the soldiers, like at the collars?

3	Is that a laptop it's on?

3	Does it come with the set?

3	Seriously though, it looks liek it has some good pieces, particularily the soldier's clothing and the crocodile hehe.

3	Hooray for new Indy sets, lets hope the film is as good (it will be).

3	Nice review, I like what I'm seeing in this set.

3	I liked the little comic, Marion should be arrested though

3	nice little review here alex, i like your idea to make the aquatic car into one for a geologist!

3	I really like the little details in this set such as the little petrol can and the propeller at the back of the car, a must buy in my view!

3	thanks again!

3	Quote Set ref: 7625 Name: River Chase I swear it is supposed to have Stickers on the Side of the Car, Boat, Oil canister and Windscreen?

3	I like this set, looks Brill!

2	I expect it does, but alex54 has left them off it, like I do.

3	Must.....have......

3	wow, this is a fantastic set, I love the Dark Green croc and other features.

3	Marion is good to have again and I love her new torso, and those commies look great as well.

3	Thanks for the review alex54.

3	Batbrick Away!

2	Or just put it up on blocks next to a trailer and you've got a nice trailer-trash section of town... Steve

3	Haha!

3	Commies This set really looks great.

3	I really see what you were saying about the whole retro thing.

3	Reminds me a bit of a Dino Island set, myself.

3	Except without the dinosaurs.

3	Always without the dinosaurs...

3	This is a must get, does anyone know when these will be released in the US?

3	<Faramir-< Edited by Faramir, 15 April 2008 - 10:50 PM.

3	What are those bricks with the guns attached supposed to be?

3	Great review and set btw...

3	My favorite part of this is prob the amphibious vehicle!

3	Looks really neat!

3	Nice to see another (different) torso for Marion...

2	Hmm I'm debating whether I should get this set..Great reveiw btw.

2	I love that dark green croc

3	Sweet review again, Alex!

3	Great pictures, I loved the little comic with the croc.

3	You're quite right here too: alex54, on Apr 16 2008, 09:17 AM, said: Yes you can use all those military things without creating an army in a layout: just put the violent parts out, and you’ve got nice things, like a biologist car in the case of the amphibious vehicle!

3	Without the gun, that vehicle is a nice little amphibious car with a tent (I assume) strapped to it, some tools, a spare tire...

3	The little tree hut is quite cool, and a nice touch with the box in behind there.

3	I love the design for those gasoline cans too.

3	Thanks again, Alex!

3	You're lucky to be getting these sets!

3	~Peace

3	Thanks for the review!

3	I really like this little-ish set, quite alot of detail, it reminds me of sets from the late 90's More Soviets are always welcome too, and the new torso for Marion is nice, as is the new dark green alligator All of the neat little accesories are great too, a cup, shovel, binoculars and of course the cans of gasoline Again, thanks for the review, alex

2	Shoc, on Apr 15 2008, 10:31 PM, said: Is that a laptop it's on?

2	Does it come with the set?

2	Yes it's a laptop, and it was in the set!

2	When I opened it, I understood why this little box was so heavy!

2	Asus is my official sponsor, so I have to show the logo!

2	I have to add that I don't have put on the stickers...

3	Great review Alex After seeing these pics i'm really looking forward to getting this set, i really like how lego has designed the gas tank that's just so good.

3	Finally a different shade of green for the croc, it's about time and more than welcome.

3	The vehicle looks good and a fun build, though i'm not that fond of that commie tree

3	Merci Beaucoup for the great review Alex !!

3	Where did you get the sets ?

3	That set is called River Chase This is a great set !!

3	I love the amphibious vehicle with all the darj green part !!

3	I agree with you that the the dark green croc is fantastic !!

3	I'm also happy to have a dark bley Zodiac and a new Marion Torso.

3	That "tree hut" is a fun feature where the playability doesn't screw the design !!

3	I really love the commies !!

3	Its fun how Lego reuses those fleshie heads and I really don't mind at all.

3	So its evil for evil since one of the commie has the zazi face I also love the ptrol cans !!

3	ingenious !!

3	I still have rants on that set: * Why oh why another similar Indy !!

3	Arghhh I can't stand it !!

3	* Why oh why the same Marion head !!

3	Can't wait to have those sets !

3	!

3	good

2	Great review and set btw...

2	Some people have obliquely mentioned this in their responses to the set/review, but to specifically answer your question, it's supposed to be a jerrycan, a.k.a.

2	a gasoline (petrol) container...

3	A very fine review of a really great set, thanks alex!

3	This set has everything, a croc, very nice MFs, a neat tree trap, a cool zodiac and a marvelous and very detailed amphibious car in a beautiful color scheme.

3	The only thing I´m not colpletely sure is the design of that jerrycan (thanks for the right word and the interesting link, Kingboy ).

3	Although the use of the revolver´s pretty clever indeed and fits well too, it´s still clearly, well, a revolver.... very unusual and interesting for an official TLC design.

3	Just like 7626 this is a must buy in my opinion.

3	I just the amphibious vehicle,very nice for army building.

3	This set looks good.

3	About the jerry cans, I like how they give me more pistols.

3	This may be the only Indy set I get from this batch.

3	I'll just have to deal with the fleshie heads... (Exchange them for yellow.)

3	Like Stealth Hunter said.

3	This will be good for army building.

3	Silent Help

2	im glad they change the torso form the prototype

3	Set ref: 7626 Name: Jungle Cutter Number of minifigs: 4 Number of pieces: unknown Price: 39,99€ A general view of the set: We’ve got 5 giant ants, two Russian soldiers, a General, Indy of course, 3 trees, a small entrance of a cave, and the debroussaillor vehicle (I don’t know the English name of it…).

3	You can’t enter into the cave, because there is a spider web with its spider…Unless… Unless you know how the mechanism works and the spider web go up… And reveals a case with diamonds and accessories.

3	A closer view on the mechanism (which is simple but works well), and you can also see the difference, or maybe the same, size of a spider and a giant ant!

3	And I’ve always thought that those spiders were very big compared to the minifigs!

3	So those ants are really giant!

3	Poor small frog!

3	The three trees with the entrance make a nice jungle layout!

3	Don’t speak too loud, you will wake up the soldier… Don’t worry for him, he will be waken up by the vehicle before being eaten by those giant ants!

3	A front view, making the vehicle really menacing!

3	A back view: Push the red part from the back and there are two parts that fall down from the vehicle.

3	I don’t know why… The movie will clarify this I think… And here you can see how the two big circular blades turn when you push the vehicle… Simple but effective!

3	Run Indy, run!

3	This set is really nice.

3	The playability of the different elements is great, the colour scheme is nice too (I like those dark green tree parts!).

3	The vehicle is really impressive without being too big and its very well details!

3	In general the designers of the Indy sets have made a really nice works, with a lot of efforts in all those details everywhere!

3	I’ve got some project for this set, to integrate it in my city... I’m a city mocer, and not an Indy fan.

3	So I don’t have bought the temple, the bigger set of the series, because it has nothing special for me in term of part selections or in the design, in relation with the town theme, and because my supermarket doesn’t have it yet!

3	So, we are waiting for a member to review it and make the part 4…

3	I like the creatures in this very much, and it is good to see the vehicle from different angles.

3	Thank you I think I shall buy this.

2	I CANT WAIT FOR THESE!

3	Oh, man, thanks for the review!

3	IMO, this looks like the best set in the new Indy line!

3	Do you have any better pics of the Colonel?

3	Excellent review Alex.

3	Thanks for sharing.

3	I can't wait to buy this set once available.

3	I really like the dark green leaf pieces.

3	I like the cave/temple which will look great in my Jungle Diorama.

3	Blending the dark green and light green works well for the vehicle.

3	Overall, a neat little set.

3	Great review, thanks for that.

3	I love almost everything about this set.

3	The ants, commies, general (can we please get a shot of his face?

3	), dark green, treads, foliage and other creatures.

3	Great stuff, i'll have to get it on sale though.

3	Batbrick Away!

3	This is a great set!!!!!!

3	It is probably my favourite Indy so so far!

3	Great reveiw!

3	Although the set is great the price is greater have to get it on sale..

3	Wow in the protype pics I kept thinking this thing looked lame; a boat on treads with saw blades?

3	But this is definetly something I want now.

3	lots of great plant and animal parts.

3	And looks like plenty of wheels with those treads; its just begging to be made into a propor tank.

3	This one is my favorite from the bunch.

3	Thanks for the time spent in making a review

3	Great review, thanks a lot for all the pics.

3	I agree that this is probably the nicest set of the Indy 4 wave.

3	So much dark green and I love all the plant pieces.

3	It's been ages since we've had enough pieces in a regular release to build nice forests so it's great to see 11 of the dark green leaves in one set and all the vines!

3	The design of the cutter looks very solid and brick built as well.

3	Giant ants are great looking too.

3	A great, detailed review for an excellent set!

3	I love the Jungle Cutter vehicle itself, and all the dark green!

3	It's great to have the trees and cave entrance; you can never have enough extras!

3	The figs are nice too; two Russian soldiers, the cool-looking general (I think his name is Dovchenko or something) and the repeated-but-still-nice Indy with RPG.

3	Thanks again, looks like I'll be picking this up along with Jungle Duel.

3	(By the way, I think this set is called Jungle Cutter).

2	Wow those trees look so weak compared to those enormous blades.

2	Anyway, a high-possibility-and-appeal-to-us-compulsive-LEGO-shoppers set, so, I'll try to get it, which means I'll obsesively look until i find.

2	Deforestation of puny trees, ON!

2	Thanks for this fantastic review, Alex!

2	Those trees are a neat add on to any jungle, as is that sweet cave.

2	But the main part of this set, the Jungle Cutter, man, that is wicked!

2	Packed with that awesome dark green and with those wonderful treads, not to mention the smoothly spinning buzz saws.

2	However, this set's a tad overpriced in my opinion, and looking through the instructions they have that crazy colour syndrome again, using blue, yellow and red parts in the internal build.

2	Still, thanks for this sweet review with neat pics!

2	*thumbup* ~Peace

3	Thanks for the review alex I agree that this is the best set of KotCS sets (although the airplane comes quite close..).

3	Although I'm not too fond of the trees, the cave is good, and the jungle cutter is brilliant.

3	Plenty of great features, and very detailed, with much of the engine showing and a decent cockpit (if that's the right word..).

3	The general and the two Soviets are great too (could we have a close-up pic of them please?

3	), good to see that neither torso has exposed fleshy skin like the Nazis.

3	As said though, it is quite a pricy set, I was expecting it to be just over the price of Race for the Stolen Treasure.

3	Great set, thanks again, alex!

2	Here some close-up pics of the Russian soldiers and the General : And I know that you have seen that I don't have put the stickers on...

3	Ahhhhh now this swamp vehicle looks great to me, when i first heard lego were making it i was worried that it would be a poor version.

3	However im pleased to see that it's not, even though i'm not a great fan of those treads.

3	The trees don't really add anything to the set which is a shame, still the parts are welcome at least.

3	The entrance is good though it could do with being bigger, but i guess we can moc that.

3	I really like the commie general, he looks like a real bad megablocks

3	Great review again Alex !!

3	Same question (in case you didn't se it in my reply to the other set): where did you get those new sets ??

3	I really love that set !!

3	Its called Jungle Cutter The trees are really cool and make a great adition to it IMO.

3	That temple entrance or monument is really cool !!

3	Those Bionicle parts do make fantastic vegetation !!

3	I totally forgot about that green frog !!

3	Thats cool , those are so cute !!

3	5 more ants is great !!

3	The vehicle look really sharp (ah ah ah).

3	2 more commies yeay !!

3	That officer is really freaky actually !!

3	Could have been a high rank under Pol Pot's regime in the S21... Yeay looks more asian than russian IMO Now its time for my grips: * same bloody rant about Indy !!

3	* I haven't read the instructions before but once again there are so many parts in crap colours that need to be changed Look at all the crap red and yellow in there !!

3	I will need to look for those parts before buying the set like I always do !!

3	Mod while building On !!

3	I am really soimpressed with that Indy line !!

3	I sincerely hope it will have a long and healthy life !

3	!

2	I get... 11 Russians!

2	And six are basic soldiers, although two are duplicates and triplicates.

2	Damn its really getting worse and worse Ahh, thanks!

2	I'm definitely changing them; they may be bearers of the Red Star but they don't need red lining inside their vehicles.

3	looks great

3	What a lovely set!

3	I think I have to put this on my wishlist,just for that beautiful woodcutting tank thingie.

3	2008 is gonna get expensive for me

2	the thing and the set is called jungle cutter and the reason the front pops off is because indy blows it up with a bazooka incase you wanted to know.

2	thanks for the nice review

3	What a marvelous diversity of plant parts, very nice MFs and a cool and detailed harvester.

3	That conventionalized cave with its neat opening feature´s also very well done.

3	Thanks for that fine review of a pretty cool set, alex.

3	This is the 3rd review, that i had read.

3	It's very tempting to fly over and get those sets from there.

3	Because, i may need to wait for some months before it arrived.

3	It seemed we will have a new small little creature to add into the ranks.

3	These "Red Ants" is cute and of course looks nasty too.

3	Haha.

3	I love those trees, foilage and plants very very much.

3	It can be used for my MOC and is good for any "Green" project related expansion.

3	I love it.

3	About the vehicle, i find it abit wierd.

3	It seemed too big in the set-up.

3	Hehe, but still i love this set.

3	Mainly, i will get it for the green parts

3	Here's a review of the second largest set in the Dragon Masters subtheme for castle month, Dark Dragon's Den!

3	Figs: The set comes with 3 Dragon knights, two of which have the dragon wings on their helmets(Sad thing is, one of my knights was missing the left wing on the helmet).

3	There are also the definitive dragon, Wiz the wizard (or Majisto if you prefer)two horses, and a hawk( try to find him in each picture!)

3	The set: there's a large spot under the mountain for the dragon to guard the treasure chest.

3	The chest has 2 red and green 1x1 circles in it.

3	Another gate in the back, along with a door for knights.

3	The right side of the mountain has a ladder and a removable rock face.

3	The left side has some stairs leading up to the top.

3	I love this tree design.

3	simple yet effective.

3	A shot of the top- Hey, what are you doing?!?

3	NO!!

3	Throw him in the dungeon!

3	Overall: This set when first released in 1993 was priced at $43USD, although that might just be because of the Juniorised pieces (6 BURPs!).

3	It's a fun set that provides excellent playability.

3	If you can find it at a $20-$30 price point, pick it up.

3	Overall grade: 8/10 Edited by KimT, 10 August 2008 - 01:33 PM.

3	This is around the time that many consider the decline of castle, in which point I somewhat agree, but admittedly it still looks like a very playable set, and the tree is very well done.

3	Thank you for the review!

3	Thanks every much for the review!

3	I remember having this set, and making really terrible stop-motion movies with it.

3	Very playable.

3	This brings back lot's of fond memories!

3	Thanks!

3	Majisto ON!

2	Ah, the wonderful Dragon Knight (Or was it Dragon Masters?)

2	sets.

2	I personally preferred the Black Knights, but these guys still had some awesome sets!

2	Thanks for this review, this looks like a neat little set, although those modern stairs look a little out of place.

2	That tree design is indeed a neat one, I remember having that in one dark Forestmen set I got.

2	The interior sure is roomy.

2	May I suggest for future review you photograph the set on a cleared table, that way you won't get distracted by the clutter in the background and can focus on the main part of the image, the set.

2	~Peace

3	This is probably one of my favourite sets and/or one of the sets which I wish I owned..the 90's was probably my favourite castle era!

3	tobad I was to young to buy this set when it came out Man I wish I had one of those dragons, they were one of the best type I reckon although all the dragon's are good thanks for the reveiw Edited by hollisbrick, 16 April 2008 - 07:41 AM.

3	Yay, go Dragon Masters!

3	I have to agree with iamded, I do like the Black Knights sets better for their design ( betrayal!

3	), however, the Dragon Knights are just awesome, 'cause they have dragons!

3	This is a nice set, with some awesome minifigs and a nice overall design.

3	I wish I had it... Go Masters!

3	Agent Rick: You're definately the Dragon Master around these parts.

3	What a great little set.

3	I really like the classic dragon which reminds me of a similar style used for the Lego crocodiles.

3	And the dungeon is pretty slick too.

3	I like the use of the large gates plus the doors.

3	Plus the set contains the blue wizard.

3	Awesome!

3	Great review.

3	Great Classic Dragon Den!

3	I love the old green dragons very much!

3	There were my fave.

3	I love these theme very much after the Black Knights era.

3	This is a very very good set!

3	I wished i can have this too.

3	A very neat set with charming MFs and a great classic dragon, a good use of BURPs and a really nice tree indeed.

3	Thanks for the review, AgentRick57!

3	this was the last castle set i got before my dark age.. really liked it although the big rock parts looked really bad ( i am kind of used to them now) unfortunately i lost the little wand.. and i never understood who is "good" and who is "bad" does the wizard own the dragon?

3	well they dont seem to be enemies but isnt the dragon supposed to be evil?

3	?

2	the wizard somehow "controls" the dragons i think, like, for example the wizard of the new castle line does with the undead skeletons.

2	but i think it isn't sure that the dragon master's wizard is evil.

2	as it is still unclear which factions of the older castle series are "good" or "bad".

3	well they dont seem to be enemies but isnt the dragon supposed to be evil??

3	I always liked the BURPs, I don't know why.

3	Maybe because they were dark grey and dark grey pieces seemed a bit hard to come by at the time.

3	I always assumed that the dragon was, sort of, the mascot of the Dragon Masters.

3	The wizard was there to keep him under control so he wouldn't turn on them.

3	I always figured that the wizard was working with the Dragon Master King, and they were fighting against the Royal Knights (the dudes with the lion faces on their torsos), or whatever they were called.

3	I like this set a lot.

3	I think the castle theme declined after the Dragon Masters and Royal Knights themes were discontinued.

3	The new knights never really took the cake.

3	It's funny, but it seems, to me anyways, that when the Lego Minifigs lost their regular smile/smirk faces (whether they were masked by a beard or not), that's when Lego began to decline...a bit.

3	The Dragon Masters had their vicious faces and all, but they still had that smile/smirk underneath their rough exteriors.

3	The new knights look a little...less confident.

3	I own this set and I think its a great for a smaller fortress building.

3	There is a good selection of mini figs, the BURPS do detract somewhat from the set, but they do make it feel as if its in a large cave.

3	The cloth flags that are included are really nice and mine have lasted a long time.

3	The 8291 Dirt Bike comes from a long line of Technic bikes, and I think it's the best ever.

3	It looks great, and it's fun to ride around in the house.

3	I hoped to find a figure the right size for it, but none of mine would fit.

3	Unlike a lot of Technic models, it looks good from all angles.

3	Considering the size of the model it has a complicated way of connecting the engine to the wheel.

3	The rear shocks are just the right stiffness... ...and they have a good amount of travel.

3	I thought these shocks were new.

3	I need to get out more...

3	Functions: Shocks: Two front, one stiffer one in the rear.

3	Drivetrain: 2 piston engine linked to the rear wheel via gears and a chainlink.

3	Steering: Yes it does...

3	Stand: Retractable.

3	For the price, size and subject, what else could be added?

3	10/10 Parts: Considering that it has three shocks and a 40 chainlinks it's a great set for parts.

3	Some hard to use large parts are included, but they are not overused.

3	The usage of the green does limit part usage somewhat though, and I'll be struggling to find a use for those wheels for anything other than a motorbike.

3	8/10 Price: At $39.99 AUD for 248 parts it isn't the best value set.

3	The US price is $25.00 which is somewhat better.

3	It does have some more complicated parts however.

3	7/10 Looks: Lego seems to be moving away from the see-though look for Technic sets and this is a good example of it.

3	I'm not a big fan of fairings but I think they work great in this set as a fuel tank.

3	8/10 Fudge: This set was great for me as I have never had a Technic bike.

3	However for those that want this for just parts or have other bikes it could be a hard sell.

3	The alternate model (a chopper) is a complete rebuild (which I didn't make), and it's great that Lego have been including these most of the time lately.

3	7/10 Overall: Recommended.

3	8/10

3	I think the green motocross bike looks great.

3	I like the use of fairings on this bike.

3	The only thing I really don't like about the Technics bikes in general, is the "clumsy" design of the chaindrive.

3	It sticks way to much out to the side.

3	If they made a really big bike model, it would be more in place with this chain drive.

3	I'm not sure if it wouldn't be possible to design a shaft drive to the rear wheel, ala BMW style.

3	But the green "Kawasaki" look great with the front and rear suspension.

3	I have the Street Bike, 8420, a somewhat larger and more complicated set, and will probably add the motocross bike to my collection soon.

3	It would be great if Lego could make a line of bikes, like they do the Ferrari line.

3	Front

2	I saw this set at my TRU for only $20.00.

2	Now I might go get it!

2	Thanks sinner for another nice review!

2	Quote hoped to find a figure the right size for it, but none of mine would fit.

2	Well, just sit your booty down and ride it wourself... ...

2	Okay, well, maybe if you have a bionicle lying around or a halo figure.

3	A very good review, thanks, Sinner.

3	That´s really a pretty cool model, very detailed with useful parts too.... hmm, perhaps that one´s gonna get the first Technic set I´ll buy, beside that 4481 Hailfire Droid.... um, thank you, Sinner....

2	Thanks for the Great review Sinner I like the Technic bikes I wonder how it would look if you replaced the gear on the back wheel with a smaller one?

3	I have just finished building this set.

3	I was a bit disappointed with the amount of bricks when they were out on my table, but the final model is really nice and totally makes up for that.

3	I like the small details like on the handles and fuel tank and the only real negative thing I can say is that the cog seems a bit oversized in the rear.

3	I don't know if the designer frequents this forum, but I'm sure he will be happy about how much you like it - it took quite some time/prototypes to get to this design: (Sorry about the size of the picture - it isn't mine)

2	Best review of a Lime Green Technic Dirt Bike ever!

2	Really, it is.

2	I just don't understand the allure of the bike very much.

2	Where does the Fabuland fig go?

2	Anyway, very insightful review.

2	Thanks for taking the time and effort to review it for us.

2	I'm not really interested in the set, but wanted to support my buddy since I know how much work you put into these.

2	Now I shall go read the cherry picker one.

2	I look forward to it because there's a walrus in it.

2	I must say that's a nice collection of motocross bikes the employe is displaying.

2	Building technic is such a specialist dicipline, I think it takes a lot of patience to finalize the design of a model, even such a relative simpel one as this "cute" bike.

2	Front Indeed it would.

2	I marvel at how they are explained so relatively simply in the instructions.

2	It must take a lot of tweaking to have the model easy to assemble.

2	Sinner, on Apr 23 2008, 10:37 AM, said: I'll try to take a photo this weekend.

2	Well, I took the photo but didn't get around to posting it!

2	Here it is with a smaller gear.

2	I think it looks better... ...the problem is that it's too tight and it doesn't rotate as freely anymore.

2	Adding another link makes it too loose!

2	Thus the set is probably the way it is as it's the gear that fit best.

2	How did I manage to miss this review?

2	I must have overlooked it somehow...

2	Thanks for making this one Sinner, it's always nice to see reviews of Technic sets.

2	I'm not so sure whether I like this set, I am not that much into motorbikes, but Lego did a good job on this one.

2	It looks a lot like an upgraded version of one of the first bikes Lego made, namely the 8838 Shock Cycle.

2	I also believe the back gearwheel is somewhat oversized, it looks better with the smaller one you attached.

2	It is good to see that Lego is back to making the Technic sets the way they were (except for the green, that is )

2	Yes, it does seem to be a remake.

2	The Shock Cycle even has a dangly chain like my modded version... As a set I'd prefer the old one due to the four indentical springs.

2	Sinner, on May 18 2008, 05:18 AM, said: You must have been ignoring me!

2	It's been in my signature for weeks!

2	This is when shame kicks in...

3	I wasn't very interested in this set at first.

3	It seemed to be just a nice looking truck with a small motor... but when I found out it had a transmission I changed my mind!

3	Here is the transmission.

3	It allows the single motor to be used for two functions.

3	This system has been around for a while, and Lego seem to be using it more and more.

3	The Transmission Driving Ring alone (the red circle) goes for $5-15 USD on BrickLink, and you also need the Catch and Clutch Gear so I have been buying sets that have them instead.

3	I now have enough parts to make a Supercar gearbox.

3	(I bet a new supercar comes out next year now...) This is the gear that rotates the arm.

3	Note the colour of the 24 tooth gear; it seems to be a new gear trend.

3	A lot of work has been put into this truck looking real.

3	Personally I think they went too far as the truck seems to have been designed for a tilting cab, but it's disabled to prevent breaking the front.

3	Bottom of the transmission.

3	The bottom shaft lifts the arm.

3	Note that there are more dark grey gears.

3	The motor fits in very well also.

3	The bottom of the arm.

3	I was surprised by the usage of a 12 Tooth Bevel to link with the 36 Tooth Double Bevel as I had never seen that done before.

3	As you can see there is no room for any drive train.

3	Standard steering for a recent technic truck.

3	There is a hand-of-god at the cab top that links via two Knob Wheels.

3	It looks good from the back.

3	You can also see the white Clutch that connects the transmission to the motor to avoid burnouts.

3	It goes decently high, and can go a bit higher if you use the crane arm.

3	Compared to last years fire truck.

3	(If I didn't buy the fire truck for half price I would have been annoyed that Lego brought out what is almost a motorised version of the same set.)

3	Functions: Cherry Picker Arm: Motorised rotate and lift that links to a motor via a transmission and anti-burnout clutch.

3	Steering: Rack and pinion controlled via a hand-of-god linked by Knob Wheels Doors: Open and close.

3	Good functionality that works well, but I wish they made the cab lift and I'm a bit sick of the lame fairing door trick.

3	7/10 Parts: Motor, battery box, transmission, clutch, practical wheels, only two fairings, compact turntable... this is a great parts set.

3	10/10 Price: At $99.99 AUD for 726 parts it's OK value when you consider what you are getting.

3	The US price is $60.00 which is better, but still not great.

3	I bought mine for $80 AUD which was good however, and I suspect that the price is designed for easy sale...8/10 Looks: I'd buy this for the looks alone!

3	9/10 Fudge: The functions work well and I llked it more than I thought I would.

3	Oddly mine seemed to be missing a Axle Pin with Friction, but since it includes extra parts for the alternate model I didn't mind using one of my spares.

3	On the subject of the alternate model, it is a dump truck which is made out to be a total re-build, but it isn't.

3	It could have easily been done like Super Street Sensation was, but Lego have probably determined that instructions like that confuse people.

3	8/10 Overall: Recommended.

3	8/10

2	Great review!

2	I never have been interested in this set.

2	I am saving my money for a grey technic set or thatt Technic ferrari set...

3	Thank you for that fine review of a pretty cool and nice set with a very good amount of functionality and, um, playability, for sure.

2	Thanks for the review!

2	I bought this set when it first came out and it is still in the box.

2	It is stuck in my fairly lengthly backlog but after seeing your review, I'll have to put it to the top of the queue.

1	Great review Sinner I bought this set a few weeks ago personally I prefer the alternative model of the flatbed truck.

2	Thank you for your detailed review, Sinner!

2	I´m not that much into Technic building because I´m lacking the inspiration to build something different with all those technic elements.

2	So I´ll pass on this one and stay to classic bricks.

2	Thanks for the review!

2	I think I am going to get this set for it's many technic pieces.

2	I could really use those for a rig I'm going to build.

2	Looks like an interesting set.

2	I didn't realize the motor controlled two functions through a transmission switch.

2	That's always good to see.

2	I'll probably pass it up though until the price falls a bit.

2	The overall design is a bit too studless for my liking (I think the 8275 bulldozer has a much better balance of studded and studless pieces), and the wheels somehow look too small to me.

2	I also have something of a backlog at the moment; I still need to pick up that bulldozer along with the 8421 mobile crane (on ebay).

2	Wow, it's a smarty set with drive shafts (We are everybody!)

2	and technical junk.

2	The specs and stuff kind of lose me but the walrus looks really cute in the cherry picker!

2	I imagine he's saving a kitten.

2	But really, this is a great review and has a wealth of detail and knowlege for techni-philes!

2	Thanks for providing such a cool resource for EB!

2	I really did enjoy delving in to the world of Technic for a few moments.

2	The walrus rides it ... oh, he's so smart.

2	Thanks for reading my review guys!

2	Honestly, if I bought this, it would be my first Technic set ever Another illusion shattered!

2	Interestingly, I've never bought a Mindstorms set as I have enough programming to do for work without doing it for fun...

2	I have been tempted though.

3	Set: 7627 - Indiana Jones - Temple of the Crystal Skull Pieces: 929 Price: $AUD149.99 Out of all the Indy 4 sets, this one seems to cop the most flak - which may account for the fact that the other 3 were reviewed weeks ago and this one has sat, unloved and alone, waiting for someone to turn their eye upon it (or, y'know, buy it).

3	Luckily I'm a sucker for spooky old temples, filled with devilish traps and hidden treasures, hissing fountains and overgrown foliage, creepy skeletons and crumbling stonework, so here it is: Indiana Jones 7627, Temple of the Crystal Skull.

3	Part 1: The Figs First off, the figs - 6 humans and 4 skellies (or should that be skullies? )

3	Indy, Mutt, Irina, and that sneery Russian guy that's in the 2 smaller sets.

3	Nothing new here.

3	Aha!

3	What have we here - two natives.

3	I wonder if hair is a sign of power in this culture, since one guy is completely bald and the other one has the most extraordinarily luxurious black mullet.

3	Somehow I doubt the movie will answer this question.

3	Back view - as you can see, the scalp tattoos are also popular in this tribe.

3	Fashion conscious!

3	(Note in the background the paws of the fearsome black jungle panther, ie my cat, curious as to see what the tribe was up to.)

3	Also, don't ask me why these guys are carrying axes rather than, say, spears.

3	And what everyone's been waiting for, the skullies - three of 'em and a conquistador skellie - very cute.

3	Note the backs of the crystal head have a plume-sized hole - or maybe that's just where they injected the blue brain-plastic.

3	Spooky!

3	I love these skulls, I wasn't sold from the initial pics but they have a very creepy smile and the head shape is just... weird.

3	With the large eyes, it's kind of Homer Simpson-esque.

3	And here we have the token vehicle in the set - a weird little tank thing with treads.

3	Kind of looks like a cross between the amphibious boat and a mini-tank.

3	I'm sure there's a military expert around here who can tell us exactly what it is supposed to be.

3	The treads are nice, but the rest of it is a bit thrown together.

3	You can tell they wanted to keep the dark green colour scheme but the budget only allowed them 5 parts to do so .

3	All in all, a mixed bag with the figs.

3	4 repeats from the cheaper sets which means we have one new native figure and the crystal skullies.

3	There are heaps of the old-skool skele heads scattered around the sets so those that prefer can replace the skullies with ordinary skellies.

3	Bizarrely, the top of the box which has the line of 1:1 figs pic (you know what I mean) doesn't have names for any of the characters, whereas all the smaller sets do.

3	Part 2: Box, Parts Front of box: Back of box: Two instruction books: Parts.

3	This set has come under criticism for being overpriced - myself included - but the official piece count is 900 plus, which is pretty good considering it also contains the baseplate.

3	6 big bags and 2 of those 12x12 bricks in dark tan.

3	(Note: set does not contain live Black Jungle Panther™) The DSS, helpfully comes pre-scrunched thanks to TLC.

3	Even in a $AUD150 set they can't get that right... sigh.

3	The dark tan baseplate.

3	Say what you like, I'm in love.

3	I know some people don't like these, but they were such a staple of Castle/ Pirates for so many years that I don't consider them a juniorised piece at all.

3	This one, recycled from the 05 Police HQ and 06 Hospital, is much better in design than the King Leo's Castle one as the different heights and asymmetry make it look much more like a natural piece of ground.

3	Perfect for MOCs.

3	And it's dark tan - how could anyone not love such a huge slab of dark tan?

3	Note this love doesn't extend to applying the stonework stickers which are, frankly, crap.

3	Random instructions page: Part 3: Temple of Doom - or just a doomed temple?

3	The complete set, front view.

3	Isometricish view: Back view: Top view: First impressions?

3	It's very dark tan, isn't it?

3	And green.

3	And bright green.

3	And dark green.

3	And dark red.

3	And normal tan.

3	And dark bley.

3	And pearl gold!

3	In fact, it's a bit of a mish-mash of colours.

3	I'm of two minds about this.

3	I kind of prefer the palette to be a bit subtler, but I can see that a playset designed for kids isn't going to sell bucketloads all tastefully done in shades of tan with lashings of dark-green foliage.

3	There's a huge amount of dark red in this set, which is always a welcome colour, but I'm not convinced it quite works with the 2 shades of tan on offer here.

3	On the plus side, there's also a huge amount of dark tan in ordinary 2x2 bricks, tiles, plates and 1x1 and 1x2x3 slopes, which is great for anyone wanting to stock up.

3	Let's take a closer look.

3	I'll do this roughly in order of the build itself: a) The big scary face.

3	This is a simple, fun build and very effective at projecting menace at the temple entrance.

3	It actually detaches very easily from the temple (as pictured on the box art) to allow easier access to the inside.

3	The eyes are flick-fire missiles, with Scary Face's hair conveniently providing ammo refills should you run out.

3	All in all, from me.

3	(b) The Back Spin the skelly head and stone steps appear - we haven't seen this feature in a while.

3	Nice to get these pieces in dark bley.

3	A conquistador hides under the stairs - this is a bit useless as the stairs can't fully extend while he's there .

3	Moving right... a trapdoor - what could possibly be behind it??!!??!!?

3	Answer: not much, really.

3	A little red stair.

3	I really like these 2 stickers though - very intricate.

3	The staircase leads to what I like to think of as the Crystal Skull Transmogrification Chamber.

3	Now, I know nothing about the movie except that it's supposed to be have a kind of 50s B-movie plot rumoured to feature (look away, spoiler-haters)..... aliens.

3	These weird, creepy gold chairs look made from the bones of aliens if you ask me, with their strange vertebrae and silver claws.

3	It wouldn't surprise me if bringing these aliens back to life was part of the plot of the movie... hence the crystal skull?

3	I guess we'll find out May 22.

3	In any case, transforming aliens clearly like a disco whirl as when you pull the handle, the whole of this assembly spins giddily around.

3	A very clever and simple trick - it's basically just a wheel under the platform but the effect is great.

3	Also under here is a bottomless pit (stickered)...

3	I would very much expect a villian to be thrown down it at some point.

3	"So, do you come here often?"

3	"I don't know who designed this club.

3	These chairs are REALLY uncomfortable."

3	NB.

3	I am really, really over those pearl gold 1x2 roof corner slopes which started popping up in the 2006 Castle range, infected Exo-Force and have now spread here.

3	Can we please have these in a different colour?

3	Or a different pearl gold piece?

3	Pretty please?

3	( c) Left tower (looking from the front) A small tower with a trans clear gem.

3	(d) Right tower Waterfall with booby trap.

3	I like the sticker, it's very cartoony, which fits with the set somehow.

3	When you turn the wheel, flick fire missiles spray out and hit whoever is on the stairs.

3	Both towers have a trap where if you move the skull, another one pops out from the dragon mouth.

3	(e) Central turret thing This thing is kind of annoying and doesn't really sit or work well.

3	It's kind of like a laser beam sending messages to space, I guess.

3	As the central dome rises, the two plates peel away.

3	I find it is a little bit tight to work smoothly and the two plates doesn't really sit well together at the top.

3	Maybe I just need to rebuild it.

3	I'm sure this will also be explained in the movie.

3	(f) Final trap - the stair that isn't there The final trap is at the front - as Indy goes down the staircase, you can push the red heads and all the 1x8 bley bricks come tumbling down.

3	Simple and works well.

3	(g) Alternate view Here's how it looks as pictured on the box with the head removed.

3	As you can see, this allows better access to the centre of the temple.

3	As you can see, sadly there is nothing actually interesting there except a staircase to the turret and 2 dark tan slopes which are just stuck there and look a little out of place.

3	I mean, come on, everything else has a splash of dark red and gold!

3	Your Destination: Nowhere!

3	Part 4: In Conclusion So after all those endless pics, what about the set itself?

3	CONS:As a playset, 7627 doesn't quite make sense.

3	Admittedly, the traps that are there are well-designed and unobtrusive.

3	On the other hand, there's a great big whopping entrance at the front - but I wasn't sure if the figs are supposed to sneak in through the backdoor and go up the spiral staircase and past the waterfall (as shown in the box art) or if they were meant to end up in the golden skull room.

3	The middle area doesn't really connect with anything, nor does the giant space turret.

3	It may be that some of these questions are answered in the film, but whereas with 7624, 7625 and 7626 I could at least picture a story myself (eg with River Chase is fairly obvious what's happening - a chase down a river with a croc and a communist staking them out)!, the Temple set is a little all over the place.

3	The design feels a little off to me - not really bad but not really great either.

3	PROS: On the plus side, the natives and crystal skulls themselves are great.

3	At 900+ pieces, this is also a great parts pack for dark tan, dark red, plant pieces, gold oddments etc.

3	I especially love the baseplate in that shade.

3	I like the overall shape of the temple - a big staircase with secret nooks and crannies.

3	The build is reasonably interesting and there are some clever tricks with the traps.

3	But upon reflection I shouldn't have to sell this set - it should be able to sell itself!

3	As I said before, I'm a huge fan of dark, mysterious old temples so for that I have to give it some love.

3	It reminds me of the big old Adventurers sets and the whiff of nostalgia is itself a powerful intoxicant.

3	However, for the price Lego is selling it in Australia/ Europe/ Canada I couldn't recommend it as a must-buy for full price when the smaller sets in this series are themselves so good.

3	Review done - woo!

3	Note the backs of the crystal head have a plume-sized hole - or maybe that's just where they injected the blue brain-plastic.

3	Spooky!

3	I love these skulls, I wasn't sold from the initial pics but they have a very creepy smile and the head shape is just... weird.

3	With the large eyes, it's kind of Homer Simpson-esque.

3	They reminded me more of the movie "Coneheads", but I think your description is more accurate.

3	Looking forward to the rest of the review!

3	The figs look great!

3	The natives and the skeleton conquistador are my favorite figures in the set.

3	The set itself is very good.

3	The interior sort of reminds me of an older style lego set for some reason.

3	It could be just me, but it has a classic feel.

3	This will a great set to add to my list!

3	Great review!

3	(So far, anyway.

3	i only saw the back of the box!)

3	Edited by General Zen, 01 May 2008 - 02:17 AM.

3	Thanks, svelte_corps.

3	I was really hoping that the conquistador helmet would end up being silver in the final set, but I suppose it's good to know that the helmet is being porduced again anyway.

3	And is the armour the skellie is wearing pearl gold?

3	Thanks again, I look forward to the rest of the review EDIT: The dark tan baseplate is in fact very nice Although the fact that you have to put stickers on it is a real downer.

3	But I suppose it is good for those who want it plain.

2	Hi TinyPiesRUs - I love that helmet too!

2	If only we had plumes again... soon hopefully!

2	The armour is pearl silver, not gold.

3	Looks great!

3	I cant't wait until I can get my hands on this and the other new IJ sets.

3	This is turning out to be a really good theme!

3	I'm really liking the crystal skulls and I also think the baseplate looks very nice.

3	Those natives look fantastic in my opinion.

3	Thanks for the great review!

1	Oh sorry, my mistake.

1	So is it pearl silver, as opposed to metallic silver?

1	That sure is an odd little vehicle The engine looks nice enough and the rubber treads are always good to have, but other than that, it really just looks thrown together.

1	Thanks again, svelte!

2	Brilliant review, and great pics.

2	Thanks.

2	Hmmmmm I would actually like one of these now, where before I was unsure.

1	Thanks for the great review, svelte_corps.

1	I've been wanting to see this set in detail since it debuted at the conventions.

1	I have to say that, on the one hand, I agree that the minifigures, the crystal skulls, and the colors are great (I even like the waterfall), but, on the other, I kind of think that the set itself is a disappointment.

1	It looks like they tried to accommodate design and playability needs, but really didn't come through on either.

1	So, as you pointed out, the mid section doesn't really fit in with the other parts, and the trap sequence doesn't really flow, either.

1	But, perhaps your right, and all will be answered in the film.

1	I was surprised at just how empty the temple looked in the photo taken from above.

1	They really should have gone the extra mile and made the temple look more like a temple, and not worry so much about the action features.

1	Eh, but so it goes.

1	But, I, too, am a sucker for tombs and temples, so I won't be able to pass it up.

1	Archaeology on!

2	Damn, you've convinced me to get it now, thanks for the review, tan is my favourite colour in Lego!

2	Batbrick Away!

3	Thanks svelte_corps for the great review, if it's out in Aussie then it should hopefully be reaching NZ soon.

3	I can't wait!

3	This looks like a great set, for me at least.

3	I too am a great fan of spooky old temples, they are such fun.

3	I love the look of the base plate, but the stickers don't look all that great.

3	I wish they printed it like they always used too.

3	I have to get this set.

3	And the other ones too.

3	Thanks again, you have brightened this sad day.

3	Outstanding review!

3	Your efforts have totally convinced me to get this set no matter what!

3	It really looks very great and funz reading that review.

3	I will be looking forward to the new addition of those mini-figs.

3	Just love the layout of this temple.

3	A great addition indeed

2	Thanks for the reveiw it was a enjoyable and good one!

2	I really like this set!!!

2	too bad it's beyond my price range, I guess i'll just get the smaler set.

2	What suprised me is that there is no giant ants I'm guessing you live in Aus.?

2	where did you get this set from??

2	?

2	Great in-depth review!!!

2	Svelte, I love your cat!

2	:) :)

3	I was going to review this on Monday but my camera ran out of batteries!

3	Anyways, great review!

3	As I have the set built, it's a really fantastic set.

3	The waterfall is a reall cool sticker, and the flick fire missiles are quite interesting.

3	Another point of interest: There are seven of the new flick fire missiles overall, if anyone cares.

2	Nice review, and your cat looks exactly like ours!

2	Shame yoda ain't around to review anymore, though... *M'aiq runs off to the nearest tavern to drink* away all thoughts of parson yoda yoda* *"I don't know how to get drunk off soda, but it's possible!"

2	-Me

3	Nice big set !

3	Thanks for the review.

3	The skellies seem to me as the only really big plus of the whole lot.

3	I agree on the Homer Simpsons' paternity to them...

2	Great~!!

2	Your cat is soooooo cute~

2	Thank you for the nice review.

2	Off-topic: I heard something on Lowlug that Tlc cancelled 2624 (Little set with Indy, Mutt, Irina and tent).

2	Have anybody heard something about that?

2	That would be not so nice.

3	Great review!

3	Now I'm really truly convinced that I'm gonna buy this set.

3	My faith was a little wobbly, but its benn restored Anyway, I just wanted to point out that the temple's entrance might actually be the turret thing.

3	If you watch the teaser, there are some very similair stone pillars surrounded by sand (there are 4 not 2 though ) and when they close up it looks like all our characters are sucked into the sand and magically appear underground going through some stone plates(which act like steps to go down) that dissapear.

3	So, in theory those steps beneath the turret are actualy the entrance, and I'm asumming from this picture That the steps with 1x8 bricks with the dragon heads at the end lead us of somewhere else.

3	All in all this temple looks like a mixed up version of the real temple, which is fine by me (SIDENOTE: I'm not sure but based on minifig inclusion, either Lego was cheap or Colonel Dovchenko is dead by the time Irina and her goons reach the temple, I'll wait till I see the movie. )

2	But I looked now on Shop@home and 7624 (I posted the wrong number, sorry) is only available in Canada and the United states, so I hope it's not an exclusive.

2	That's AWESOME!!!

2	I'm going to my local TRU today to see if I can find the two smaller sets.

1	The architecture/aesthetic design looks like a twelve year old's modification of the real set.

1	The parts look good though.

3	I know that alex54 had already reviewed this set beforehand, but I wanted to give my 2 cents (it is really more like $1.50) on this set I bought from toys 'r' us on friday (guess what, the price had not been increased by a dollar like all other sets, ).

3	This is my first review of a set ever, don't be too mean.

3	1) Box It captures the potential (I don't know how the scene plays out... for now ) action of the scene nicely and is very pleasing, good job TLC .

3	On the back it shows some of the play features of the set and a net little comic.

3	Indiana Jones seems to be surprisingly calm considering that he is about to be captured under a net and attacked by a snake (the thing he fears most).

3	1a) comic not much to say on this... 1b) screw up At the top of the box, both "Russian Guards" have the same grining face, in the set one has the generic bad guy face from 7620.

3	2) Contents The box opens up to reveal a quartet of bags, an un-crumpled manual (YAY!

3	), and a sticker sheet (BOO!)

3	2a) DSS Yoda said every for of rambling imaginable about this accursed item, I have nothing to say.

3	Meh... 3) Minifigs The only thing that has not really been discussed about the figs that you get in this set is that Marion has a slightly new torso.

3	4) Parts of interest When I opened up the baggies, these were the components that grabbed my attention.

3	A DARK GREEN alligator, a net piece that I Know has appeared in sets before hand ( I needed it for a MOC I am working on), some raft part that is probably very old, a ladder with two pairs of hindges, and a DARK brown version of this part.

3	4) Build (amphibious vehicle) This I one of the more enjoyable builds of the new line.

3	But that is just my opinion.

3	You start of with some thing very simple... By the end of the next page, it starts to bulk up More detail... Beginning to look like a car... 4a) Build (rear attachment) Bulk it up and add Taillights...

3	Done...

3	Slap it on to the main vehicle... 4b) Build (Front attachment) I am running out of things to say...

3	Bulk it up... Add some detail... Add a gun and headlights... And attach to the rest to get the completed vehicle... Add stickers...

3	I honestly think that the amphibious vehicle looks much better with the stickers than without... 5) Build (boat) This build goes by rather quickly and adds to the playability of the final set.

3	Base...

3	Apply clamps... Add more to engine...

3	Build more detail and a gun base...

3	Finished boat... Plus stickers...

3	I love how Lego slips in the product number into their stickers.

3	6) Build (tree fort) This is the weakest part of the whole set.

3	But I find my self liking it more and more for some odd and inexplicable reason.

3	That tan 6x6 will most likely see use in a pirate themed vinigete soon (not mine ).

3	Install net-launcher... You spend the next two pages building this... And putting it on... A tree branch that is an ugly mix of brown, dark brown, and frown... (our commie friend seems to like coffee a lot) Second branch... 3rd... (a wee bit to much on the coffee there, don't you think?)

3	Final step...

3	The only redeeming value of this section is how well the net launcher works, fantastically.

3	The rest is just utter fail.

3	7) Spare parts Very little in terms of what is left over...

3	Finished set... All in all, this set is a fine build and an excellent parts pack for dark green components.

3	I recommend this set strongly, despite its few weaknesses.

3	NIce review!

3	Got this set yesterday and U have to say, that amphibious vehicle rocks!!

3	!

2	Great review, thanks!

2	As i thought, amazon did send out my pre-ordered sets not until yesterday evening, so i should receive them (hopefully) on monday or tuesday.

2	Can't wait for them!

2	Btw., i wonder what's up with all these sticker leftovers in the indy sets..this hasn't been the case in any other set with stickers, right?

2	Edited by metalandi, 03 May 2008 - 01:56 PM.

2	I brought this set a few days ago and agree with everything you say.

2	I would have never noticed that the boat sticker is the set number unless you pointed it out.

2	Glad to see that one set of fuel can stickers was extra, i spent ages looking for a place to put them.

2	cool review btw

2	Nice review!

2	Although you need to use the Macro setting(a.k.a.

2	the Flower setting) for better pics.

2	Are you using a digital camera?

2	You really need Macro...

2	The idea is, turn it on and hold down on the 'take picture' button halfway until the pic focuses.

2	Then press it down all the way to take the pic.

2	I'm glad this one also comes with the new Uzi; I wanted an extra...

2	A very nice review of a very lovely Indy set indeed, thanks wilhelm screamer.

2	But you need for sure a better lighting for taking your pictures....

2	Good,thorough review.

2	Some of the pictures were a bit blurry though.

3	Thank you for the nice, in-depth review!

3	I have to say, Lego did a good job on the amphibious vehicle.

3	P.S.- If you need photo taking help, PM me and I can give you some handy tips.

2	Nice review Wilhelm Screamer!

2	Very thorough.

2	The pictures are a little dark and blurry, though.

2	I made a tutorial here for amateur photography tips.

2	I also edited your first post to include a link to Alex's review.

2	Great job!

3	Very good for a first review!

3	I bought this set and Jungle Duel at Target the other day (I was going to wait and buy them when I go to Downtown Disney this summer, but how could I pass up saving four bucks that I can spend on store-exclusives? )

3	and I have to say I absolutely love them.

3	The amphibious vehicle (don't they call it a Duck in the movie?)

3	is definitely my favorite LEGO vehicle I've ever built.

3	Everything about it is wonderful- the size, the colour scheme, and it's accurate to the one in the movie.

3	And Irina Spalko's hair is to die for.

3	On a side note, I don't get why they made Marion's arms white in the set.

3	The shirt underneath her vest in the movie is obviously blue.

3	I switched the arms out for light blue ones and it looks a lot better, and it makes Marion's eyes look great.

3	-Ryan

3	An extremely thorough review - you definitely do this set justice.

3	Looks like a fairly interesting set, and that comes from someone who isn't particularly a fan of lego Indiana Jones.

3	Tom

3	While i truely fell in love one more time with the older lego city sets, i thought, why not make a review of one of the, in my opinion greatest city sets of all time.

3	Let's not talk too much, here we go!

3	Set Nr.

3	: 6395 Name: Victory Lap Racetrack Number of minifigs: 13 (!!)

3	Number of pieces: unknown Release Year: 1988 Starting with the beautiful old Legoland box: Front: Back, with some cool alternative models: Inside: We continue with the great minifigs, which are not less than 13!

3	I don't think there is any city set with more figures, is there?

3	Civilians: Race Crew & Assistant Personnel: Drivers: All: Here's a overview of the whole set: The "Rescue Rig" (don't exactly know how to call it) with trailer: The score board & Traffic Lights, which would be one of the details i love the most about this set: The next sweet detail, the Camera + Cameraman!

3	Of course we have a doc, if there is some kind of accident: The pit stop boxes, i love the small tool-holder with the axle and wheel behind it: The control room high above the racetrack: Ready to go?!!

3	That was it all in all,all i can say is, if you see this set anywhere on ebay ore somewhere else, get it!

2	What a fantastic set.

2	I'm overwelmed with feelings of nostalgia by seeing this review.

2	The playability factor of this set is as high as it can be.

2	Thanks for making and sharing this awesome review !

3	Thanks for this review!

3	You have reviewed my most favourite town set of all times, I am so happy to own this one.

3	I actually is a story to go along with it: In the summer of 1998 I went on holiday with my parents to the country of Luxembourg, in the city of Wiltz we encountered a small toystore which still had this set for sale, (9 years after the release!).

3	I did not had the sufficient amount of money to buy the set and had to leave it at the store, I was practically in tears... Four years later we passed through Luxembourg and I remembered the city and the store.

3	We made a detour and stopped by the same store.

3	Every other old set was sold, the only one remaining was this one!

3	I bought it immediately and treasured it ever since.

3	I use the baseplates a lot in my cities, they serve well as roads with parking spaces next to them.

3	This was the first set I owned which had the huge 6x24 plates in them, I remember my surprise when seeing plates of such enourmous lenght...

3	I recently made an entire racetrack together with this set and to promote myself I will place a link HERE

2	metalandi Thanks for this wonderful lovely review.

2	I enjoyed myself very much when I am looking through at the lovely pictures.

2	I must admit, this is what I called a "real classic" race prix I miss those cute sweet little race cars which is able to contain a mini-fig.

2	Furthermore, this set offers 4 race cars and 13 mini-figures In addition, if town collectors remember, the car number tiles are printed instead of using stickers.

2	This is the other set I owned, which holds the similarity above.

2	6381: Motor Speedway Overall, great review!

2	Nice reveiw I would fork out $100 AUD for that set its just so bueatiful if only TLG re-released this

2	Ahhhh... back in the days when Shell was the racing fuel of choice before that Octan company came to town, bought off the old Shell execs and ran them out of town on a rail... but I digress...

2	I always liked the look of the set, but at the time could not work out where I would be able to fit it into my town...

2	wow simon you got two?

2	yummy!

2	Thank you for the nice review Metalandi, And thank you for the nice story and selfpromotion Simon Willems.

2	The racewaytracks were always nice dioramas in the catalogues of the eighties.

3	I can remember when I saw this set in LEGO catalogues, looking at it, dreamin to have it.... like so many other sets... And this one is still a dream...

3	I really like the design of this set, it looks really complete, with some nice details.

3	There are no lost place.

3	The strairs withe the foot bridge add a lot to it IMO.

3	Looking at the pics, I've got a question : is the "Rescue Rig" trailer one piece or is it brick build?

2	adik_sa_lego, on May 15 2008, 08:29 PM, said: wow simon you got two?

2	yummy!

2	I'd be happy if I had two... No, it's just one, but extended with the baseplate of 6381 (mentioned above) and some more plates and small fences.

2	alex54, on May 15 2008, 10:20 PM, said: Looking at the pics, I've got a question : is the "Rescue Rig" trailer one piece or is it brick build?

2	It is one piece, not even the wheels come off...

2	This trailer is always ready to go and was only used in a slecect number of sets.

2	Thank you very much for that fine review of a really classic and wonderful racing set!

2	And I really wish that TLC would continue with showing some great alternative models on the back of the boxes.... just imagine on!

1	Hello all, I don't believe there has been a review of this set yet, so I wanted to take this opportunity.

1	Up for review today is 8160 Cruncher Block and Racer X as part of Batbrick and iamded reviews: Here is the box, I have to say I love the art on it.

1	It's very colourful and makes the truck look a lot less crap than it does on the box.

1	Plus, you have to love the "Missile launching action" bit right, am I right?

1	Why are you all staring at me?

1	And here is the back.

1	Pretty generic, but shows some nice details and so forth.

1	Oh dear!

1	In turning around the box have I killed myself AND iamded!?

1	Okey dokey, up first is the best part of the entire set: the minifigs!

1	Racer X is wonderful, though coming with a boring Bruce Wayne face.

1	But it is Cruncher Block, his lady Driver Taejo that really shine.

1	Look at those awesome suits!

1	The cool faces!

1	Taejo has a ripped shirt!

1	Now up is the first building part of the set, with me and iamded looking rather slick in X's car.

1	While I'm not a big fan of yellow, it is very nice, and slopes in an underused colour is better than no slopes at all: Front view, the new windshields are fantastic: While a very cool car, it is rather silly of TLC to give us the exact same one we got in the smaller set.

1	I didn't get the smaller set with this car, so I'm still happy, but it is a bad marketing move: Sorry iamded, I know it's your birthday, but......VROOM!

1	Now for the second part of the build and my favourite, the front of the truck: Annoyingly enough, this part opens up to shoot a pointless rubber projectile: To do this, you open the roof (a nice detail btw) and pull back the mechanism, here: Thus blowing the front part open and launching it.....well, not far really The wheels and covers are pretty cool, and the front is nicely designed, the red looks good and the rear vision mirrors are a great touch.

1	And now for the most disappointing part - step three, the trailer: (Note - Clicky joint piece not part of set, just used to hold it up!)

1	That's right, almost the entire thing is open, even the "filled in" side has holes!

1	I'd certainly be cared to be back there, one bumpy hill and back you go!

1	I didn't put the lame computer stickers on, and the control area is pretty lame in general.

1	Not to mention Taejo (who is depicted on the boxart as standing at the desk, would most likely just be sucked out the back at those speeds!

1	There are some pluses too though, like the ridiculously awesome minifig paintings I'll be using for Wayne Manor.

1	Also note the "control" on Cruncher's desk that when turned, turns the gun at the bottom.

1	It's an alright feature: Here is an example, I've shot iamded on his birthday.

1	What?

1	It's a love ray!

1	Haven't you seen the Care Bears?

1	And though I'm not a massive fan of stickers, this is just too cool.

1	The little aquarium is very simple but very clever, using a printed piece between two clear windows to create the illusion of a tank: It looks much better in real life, trust me, and here is a side view to better explain: Now, to connect the two is a good thing, I like the way a simple technic piece assumes the job.

1	Oh, and behold my hand!

1	The completed truck, which, while a mixed bag, still doesn't look too bad (I guess): Now the completed set, which, despite its unbelievable large flaws, still looks cool.

1	(Warning, the kickass iamded and Batbrick figures do not come with this set): More pics here: http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=3147324 All in all: Minifigs: 5/5 - Racer X is beautiful, Cruncher Block and the Driver too, and Taejo has a ripped shirt, damn!

1	Design: 2/5 - Pretty poor considering the best part is available in a cheaper set, and only the front part of the truck looks cool, but still not truly awful.

1	Build: 3/5 - Despite having a bad trailer, it was a fun build and sometimes you need something that doesn't take ages to make.

1	Price: 2/5 - Overpriced easily, but Rogue Shadow is worse!

1	Fun: 3/5 - The mere concept of such an open truck kept me playing with this baby for hours!

1	Total: 15/25, not as bad as it would seem.

1	Overall I'm really glad I bought it as the minifigs are fantastic and the paintings and fish tank are cool.

1	It's fun, stupid and downright ridiculous, but while not a great set by any means, certainly isn't as bad in the brick as it looks in photos.

1	Until next time, Batbrick Away!

1	Awesome review Batbrick!

1	I don't see any appeal at all really in this set, but that's okay, as I want to stick to Castle anyway.

1	The car is the best part IMO, which you can get in a different set with another cool car and for a cheaper price.

1	But the main downfall to this set is the fact that the truck's trailer is half blown up and the survivors are magically staying inside and not being sucked right out of there, as you have mentioned.

1	I would have thought TLC would at least included some sort of cover that you could take on and off easily (kind of like the modular buildings).

1	Having said all that though, the front of the truck does look incredibly cool, and those minifigs are sweet.

1	Too bad they all have flesh tone printed on them.

1	So, while this may not be my set of choice, I can see the appeal... well, really I can't, but it's just my opinion!

1	I'm sure there are plenty others who would love to scoop this set up.

1	~Peace

1	I'll be passing on this set, thanks for the review anyway, is everyone supposed to be bald in the film?

1	it looks weird

2	WARNING!

2	This reply may contain several minor movie spoilers.

2	If you haven't yet seen the movie and want it to be a complete surprise, do not read.

2	Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: But it is Cruncher Block, his lady Driver Taejo that really shine.

2	Look at those awesome suits!

2	The cool faces!

2	Taejo has a ripped shirt!

2	I was originally skepitcal about the driver figure—I like the head, but I was trying to figure out why they put in a female minifig with no hairpiece.

2	After having seen the movie, I now understand why; Cruncher's driver is a fairly manly looking woman, and most of the LEGO hairpeices would make the minifig look too girly for the character.

2	:) Now that I know why Taejo's shirt is ripped up I don't mind the bits of fleshie color that are printed on it, but I do wish they would make some of the new torsos a little more head-colour agnostic...there's no real reason why Cruncher and his driver couldn't have had ties that came all the way up to their necks instead of having those little wedges of flesh showing through loose collars.

2	Yeah, they are low-level mafioso type scum, but they aren't complete slobs.

2	Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: Front view, the new windshields are fantastic: They are indeed very nice, it's the main reason I started looking at the Speed Racer sets in the first place.

2	Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: While a very cool car, it is rather silly of TLC to give us the exact same one we got in the smaller set.

2	I didn't get the smaller set with this car, so I'm still happy, but it is a bad marketing move: I think the error they made was in the smaller set though.

2	In the movie, the only time we see Cruncher's semi is when he's being chased by Racer X. Racer X and Taejo do end up on the same team for a cross country rally race (along with Speed of course), so I guess that's where they were going by putting those two together in the smaller set, but it would have been much more interesting for them to have made up a set with Taejo and one of the cars from the very goofy, comic book-gimmicky teams they are racing against.

2	Especially since one of the teams (that is chasing Taejo specifically) is a bunch of Army-wannabee loonies—I'm sure more people would have loved some sort of dark/sand green racer with one of the IJ Soviets at the wheel than another Racer X.

2	To summarize: Two Racer X's is bad, but it is the smaller set that should have been changed (imho).

2	Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: Annoyingly enough, this part opens up to shoot a pointless rubber projectile: Thus blowing the front part open and launching it.....well, not far really As much as I normally don't like the stupid techic launcher thing, and would rather not see it in a set ever again (although one of these days I will make a giant multi-launcer rig out of them just for fun), at least there is a reason for it to be in this set, as Cruncher's semi has a missile launcher in the front end of it in the movie.

2	I think you're supposed to lift the panel that hides the missile before launching it, similar to the way that panels slide out of the way on the semi cab to allow for firing in the movie.

2	Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: And now for the most disappointing part - step three, the trailer: That's right, almost the entire thing is open, even the "filled in" side has holes!

2	I'd certainly be cared to be back there, one bumpy hill and back you go I'm gonna chock this up to the standard LEGO philosophy of "playset" rather than "model" design for a lot of things.

2	The semi rig and Raver X's car are the models, the trailer is the playset.

2	Seeing as how the trailer is Cruncher's mobile office (rather finely appointed with lots of paintings and his pirahna "babies" in their tank behind his desk), and the intent seems more or less to have a playest bit in order for kids to re-enact the scene from the movie, I'm not going to give them too much grief over this.

2	They tried to capture the basic bits of the movie set (which we see mostly from the inside during the movie) and translate it into a playset type environment.

2	That being said, I do wish the back walls were more solid, as I see no reason for there to be gaps in the back wall when the front wall (or the "fourth wall" as the case may be here) is already conspicously absent.

2	Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: There are some pluses too though, like the ridiculously awesome minifig paintings I'll be using for Wayne Manor.

2	Also note the "control" on Cruncher's desk that when turned, turns the gun at the bottom.

2	It's an alright feature: Could have been a little better, but it's such a minor bit of this scene in the movie that I can see why they didn't spend too much time and effort on it.

2	It would have been nice to have more paintings though, had the back wall been more complete (and I like your idea of how to use them :) ).

2	Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: And though I'm not a massive fan of stickers, this is just too cool.

2	The little aquarium is very simple but very clever, using a printed piece between two clear windows to create the illusion of a tank: Definately a feature which is not showcased nearly well enough on the box art.

2	Since it is one of the major features of this set in the movie, it's nice to see it translate rather well into brick.

2	Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: Design: 2/5 - Pretty poor considering the best part is available in a cheaper set, and only the front part of the truck looks cool, but still not truly awful.

2	That may be a bit harsh (but not much) given what I've said further up this post, but it probably only deserves a 3 at best, so I'm not realy going to quibble the point.

2	:) I still think that Racer X should be exclusive to this set and a different car should be in the smaller set with Taejo, which would have improved the cachet for this set overall.

2	Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: Price: 2/5 - Overpriced easily, but Rogue Shadow is worse!

2	True...this should have ideally been about a $30 set (especially given the general awesomeness of the IJ Race for the Stolen Treasure set), unless they made the trailer a bit more detailed (better back wall, perhaps some drop down gun ports like in the movie) or at put least one (or more) of Cruncher's goons in the set, then maybe I could agree more with the msrp.

2	On that note: if I remember correctly from my visit to my local TRU yesterday in search of the new IJ sets (since local Targets seem determined not to get them in stock yet), they had this set on sale for around $35 along with an offer for a coupon good for $7.50 towards the purchase of a ticket to the movie with any Speed Racer toy purchase over $25.

2	I may be wrong on the sale price, but I know the ticket offer was there.

2	So, if you haven't seen the movie yet, and are interested in this set, TRU may be the place to go right now to get both at a slightly cheaper price.

2	Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: Fun: 4/5 - The mere concept of such an open truck kept me playing with this baby for hours!

2	So you did enjoy the playest aspect of the trailer, even though you didn't care for the design...looks like they didn't do too badly then on what they wanted out of that bit.

2	:) Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: Overall I'm really glad I bought it as the minifigs are fantastic and the paintings and fish tank are cool.

2	It's fun, stupid and downright ridiculous, but while not a great set by any means, certainly isn't as bad in the brick as it looks in photos.

2	I was actually thinking about going and getting this set now that I've seen the movie and I understand what the heck is going on here more.

2	Your review has definately added an additional impetus to that notion.

2	My pocketbook (does not) thank you!

2	Thanks for that fine review, Batbrick.

2	The most interesting part of the set, for me, are the neat MFs.... the trailer looks really pretty skeletal.

2	However.... it´s a nice little play set and´ll fit its purpose I guess.

2	Nice review.

2	Good pictures, thanks.

2	I think I may get a couple of the smaller sets, as I think these will become collectors sets in years too come, Not sure this range will be that popular?

2	Love the minifigs though.

1	Batbrick thanks for the sweet review.

1	You give me great insights into this set.

1	Hehe, I agreed that Racer X is nice, but I believe we can get it in the other set for a much lower price.

1	For me, the trailer which does not have a cover is bugging me alot.

1	That's why, I holding my reservations against this set.

1	At most, I will consider the other 2 smaller sets for collection purpose.

1	Nevertheless, Batbrick great job

1	Thanks for the review.

1	My wife wanted me to buy this for the fishtank, and I came close!

1	Untimately this set didn't offer many good part to me so I bought the smaller set with the same car.

1	The trailer is just too insubstantial...

2	Thank you for the nice review

3	Thanks for the great review!

3	It seems like the most awesome part of the set is the sticker sheet, which is a reversal of the usual situation!

3	I bought this set a few days ago and agree with what you have said about it.

3	The trailer is fun to play with but just so plain.

3	Overall great review.

3	I really like this set: My favorite parts are the minifigs and X's car.

3	VROOOM!

2	I enjoyed the review.

2	Some cool fleshie heads and parts, but it does seem a bit lamer even than I imagined from the box (the "airy" truck is rather slyly disguised on the box art).

2	I would like to get it if it is ever on sale, 50% off would be nice :) Speed Racer Lego doesn't seem to be selling too well in local shops here.

2	Hi all Newly arrived today, don't you just love Shop at Home.

2	Thought I'd give it a quick review.

2	See more details over at my site.

2	The Tumbler: Joker's Ice Cream Suprise

2	Nice review--I'm surprised these are out already.

2	I'll probably end up passing on this one.

2	Even with the surprise.

2	:)

3	Good review.

3	A must have for my batman collection.

3	Are these sets already out in germany?

3	Good review.I think the sets amazing!

3	The Batman minifig have a detailed and cool torso.

3	Thanks for the review brickbitz.

3	Edited by darkrebellion, 16 May 2008 - 07:31 PM.

2	That is a very nice and quick review!

2	Thanks for giving us a quick summary.

2	Not much comments on this set, as I do not really go into Batman theme yet.

2	However, the ice cream truck in the set interest me.

2	Apart from that, nothing much yet.

2	Who knows, maybe I will change my mind in the future.

3	Must...Get...!

3	!

3	Nice review, brickbitz.

3	I actually think this kit is really very nice for the size.

3	True, you only get three figures, but it seems that's a norm in most batman sets.

3	Besides, everything else is great.

3	The tumbler looks like an amazing build - they really nailed this tank of a ride.

3	And the Ice cream truck... Plus, this set does seem to have some neat pieces in it (trans green popsicles and lime hubcaps, anyone?).

3	I think this far beats the rest of the batman lineup this year, which seems quite disapointing overall.

3	Edited by Grevious, 16 May 2008 - 08:12 PM.

3	It's on the way!

3	And also the buggy!

2	Oh wait, Is that torso dark grey or light grey?

2	Ronan Nissen, on May 16 2008, 10:05 PM, said: Oh wait, Is that torso dark grey or light grey?

2	It's definitely dark grey.

2	Great review, as always!

2	Although I know you don't take many pictures in your reviews(IMHO, ) but can we see a little more about the Tumbler?

2	Is that little windshield down near the bottom front a third seat?

2	What is in the framework of the back, behind the cockpit?

2	I know there's a blunt shooter and flick fire missiles, but is it all framework?

2	trooperdavinfelth, on May 16 2008, 11:11 PM, said: Although I know you don't take many pictures in your reviews(IMHO, ) but can we see a little more about the Tumbler?

2	I'll get some set up tomorrow in better light.

2	To be honest there isn't a lot to see, most of it is just basic technic blocks underneath with all the slopes built up on top.

3	Thanks a lot for the review brickbitz.

3	I really love this set, sure the figs are annoyingly not new, but the ice cream truck is fantastic and the Tumbler is a marvel of black slopes.

3	I see now that it is far too huge though, I reckon I will either keep it that way as a "mega tumbler", mod it to become another Battank, keep it as a model Tumbler, or pull it apart and use the bits to make a Tumbler like Wetwire's awesome one.

3	Love those popsicles though, and those wheels are very nice, so overall as a loyal Batfan I love the set, even though it could've been better.

3	Batbrick Away!

3	Nice review I really can't believe that it is out already!

3	I love that new Batman suit and the tumbler have they made the posicles before?

3	This is sure a must have!

3	A nice review of an interesting set, thanks brickbitz.

3	A great new Batman, a funny ice cream truck and a pretty detailed Tumbler.

3	And although I wish that vehicle would be just a bit smaller I almost wonder that it´s not even bigger, compared to TLC´s other Batvehicles.... And well, the interior could be better too....

3	The Tumbler is massive!

3	I'll struggle to fit it into the Cave, but never mind.

3	The figs are nice, the Tumbler is pretty accurate (or at least, it will be after I've MODed it), and Joker's tainted ice cream van is so very Joker.

3	Thanks for the review, btw.

2	Hey brickbitz, I love how your review is not biased 10 ups.

2	In the end, you said, "Overall slightly disappointing."

2	Most people post reviews only with praise, but I'm glad you take both sides .

2	Enjoyed the review just like others have, thanks so much

3	General Grievous Reviewed by Dunamis Set 10186 1,085 Pieces $89.95 from LEGO Shop @ Home Build time 3.5 hours It is the start of summer here in California and along with the weekly deluge of new action films we start to see some of the next wave of Star Wars LEGO sets.

3	The latest offering from our favorite building toy company is none other than the infamous General Grievous!

3	No doubt you all know the story of Grievous; two parts Technic and one part human and his hatred of the Jedi.

3	Follow along as we get a close-up view of the mighty General.

3	No doubt the observant will wonder why I purchased this set from Shop @ Home instead of my trusty LEGO store in Glendale.

3	Well, it’s really as simple as two things: I’ve been traveling a lot and didn’t have time to drive to the store to get it AND gas is now $4/gallon and I would likely spend more in gas than the $9 shipping cost to get it to me.

3	So there you have it.

3	The Box: A gigantic box (much larger than expected) held the mighty General.

3	We’re back to the perforated tabs on the side and two stickers on the front that let the box lift open: Inside, we have 17 bags, two manuals and three stickers on a relatively small sticker sheet.

3	The Manuals: The manuals are not terribly thick in fact the second manual is noticeably thinner than the first.

3	They come in at 75 and 31pages.

3	Interesting to note on the back we see the next (and more interesting) wave of sets later this summer.

3	Nothing new to report on the manuals as they provide the LEGO standard of high quality and features we expect.

3	- Piece callouts - Models divided into sections - Large images - Page numbers Since there were links posted to the .pdf files of the instructions online, I’m sure you can all get an idea of the manual and the parts inventory.

3	However, for those of you without access to the Internet here are photos of the parts inventory pages: Random manual image: Features page: The Pieces: The short answer is you get lots and lots of little pieces in white, gray and black plus some big pieces in white, gray and black.

3	Mixed in the set is a fair amount of oddball pieces like minifig tools, Jedi hood and trans yellow dome.

3	Fear not, despite the eclectic collection of parts, it all comes together in the end (not unlike a typical day at work for me…) It is probably worth noting again that there is a heavy amount of Technic parts and pieces here.

3	The Build: The build starts off with a rather in-depth build of the stand in which General Grievous stands on.

3	Once you think you are done, you keep adding on to this (rather solid) base.

3	I bet there are 250 pieces just in the base alone!

3	It is quite nice when you get done with it though and really adds to the display.

3	I’m glad LEGO didn’t skimp on the base as it completes the model.

3	Once you get through all that, the rest of the build is a real thumb-bruiser.

3	Anyone who has built a decent size Technic set knows the feeling of your thumbs being sore when you are done.

3	You get the same effect here.

3	It is actually a fun build and I really liked seeing how the designers used all the various pieces to recreate a fairly accurate model of Grievous.

3	The model is built from the ground up as seen in a few of the progress shots: Here is what is left over: The Design: The design is quite good and is very accurate.

3	Some might be disappointed that since this is a Technic set we don’t have more articulation in the shoulders and have the ability to separate two arms into four as seen in the movie.

3	However, it would seem the real intent is for display and not functionality.

3	Here is a shot of the torso and the detail involved: Here are Grievous’ organs: Careful observers will note that my model is lacking two “arrow” stickers from the two white chest pieces.

3	I failed to see these on the sticker sheet and only grabbed the large Grievous sticker.

3	So, note that there are actually THREE stickers and not ONE.

3	Chest protector and respirator: Head and arms: I was a little disappointed that we got two yellow blades and no green blades on the lightsabers.

3	Note how all the lightsabers have different hilts which is a nice touch: Here are some shots of the completed model with a few other sets shown for scale.

3	He is actually pretty tall: You have the option to remove the top two arms and put in shoulder plates if you so desire: Detail on the back: Overall Thoughts: I’ve been saying for a few years that we should have a Technic Grievous set and we finally got one.

3	Designed more as a model and not a fully functional swooshable figure, Grievous is a tad flimsy.

3	You won’t want him to veer too far off his massive and sturdy base.

3	It would have been nice to have is cape with him (like the Technic Vader set).

3	I do like the size of the model and it is impressive to look at.

3	LEGO Star Wars System fans will likely want to think twice before purchasing but Technic and UCS fans should be satisfied.

3	Final Rating: 75% Build 8/10 (Very Good – Fun, relatively quick build.

3	Technic fans will be more pleased than others.)

3	Design 8/10 (Very Good – Some nice SNOT and Technic techniques.

3	A bit flimsy but the base is kind of cool.)

3	Parts 7/10 (A mixed bag of stuff.

3	Probably can’t get too many diverse builds from this except for other robot type models.)

3	Price 7/10 (Just OK – A bit stiff at $90 USD for a nice display model with limited functionality.)

3	As always, let’s hear your thoughts and feedback.

1	Thanks so much dunamis for your awesome review .

1	Yeah I think TLC miss the cape, it would be cool to own one but when we were talking of the 2008 sets around july of last year I can remember someone said it would come with cape.

1	Finally is a little dissapoint TLC miss it .

1	Edited by darkrebellion, 16 May 2008 - 07:20 PM.

3	Excellent review, Dunamis.

3	This set looks great.

3	The designers really though the kit out, it seems.

3	The internal organs have got to be my favorite part, but everything is good.

3	Now all we need is a UCS Obi-Wan with a laser pistol to finish off Grievous in a totally anti-climatic way!

2	Hey Dunamis, think you can get a straight-on shot of the face?

2	The red pieces inside the eye sockets are topped with trans-greenish-yellow studs which make his face look eerily alive and very close to his screen appearance.

2	It's a nice little detail that seems to not show through on pictures I've seen of the set.

2	The legs are a little wobbly.

2	I'm scared that he'll be leaning too far forward in about 5 years

3	Nice review dunamis !

3	I built it two weeks ago on the LEGOWORLD speedbuild in Oslo and didn´t have time to get the "feel" during that crazy race.

3	Thanks for that fine review, dunamis.

3	I really like that set.... GG´s an interesting and well designed movie character and that LEGO version of him´s indeed well done and very detailed.

3	And although I would wish for a some more functional (or playable ) feature of move- and even splitable arms I guess it´s an already very cool UCS version of that grumpy old Kaleesh....

2	OK, here are a couple of shots of the head and eyes: A very nice effect.

3	Awesome review, Dunamis!

3	That's such a sweet set, I loved it as soon as I thoroughly examined the online instructions.

1	Snice review!

1	(Super nice) Though I think I'll pass on this one, I really dislike the head.

1	What's with the frame around the neck and the clip under the head?

1	That, and I don't really care for UCS or technic stuff.

1	The base looks nice though!

3	This is a very nice, i never gotten to chance to own or buy one of the SW big sets.

3	Detailed report,thx for sharing.I love to see the special parts of it!You persuaded me to buy this!

2	nice review!

2	but id rather save my money for the indy and Clone Wars sets.

2	LEGOscum, on May 17 2008, 04:03 PM, said: You forgot to add the stickers to the chest plates too.

2	Jeremy Yeah, I know.

2	I mentioned it in the review that I completely blew past the other two stickers.

2	If you look closely, you can see that the big Grievous nameplate sticker is off-center as well.

2	Me and stickers don't get along...

2	Great review, very detailed indeed!

2	nice review i hope to get this set for my birthday!

2	Thanks for the great review!

2	Sad to say, as cool as he looks, he's a sale-only set for me.

3	Hi all again.

3	Another one of todays special deliveries.

3	I think personally this set is great.

3	Mars Mission is really finding it's feet.

3	7646 ETX Alien Infiltrator

3	The walker reminds me of the old Kenner CAP-2 Captivator which is good.

3	Thanks very much for the review brickbitz!

3	I love this year's Mars Mission line, and though this is the weakest set, it is still a major improvement.

3	The mech is very cool and well made, and the Commander is one of my favourite alien figs ever.

3	The alien ship is pretty good, better than last years ones but not extremely good either, but i still like the set.

3	Batbrick Away!

3	Thanks for the sweet review, brickbitz!

3	That really is a neat little set, that walker is fantastic, most likely the best part of the set.

3	Though the alien craft does also look neat, and it's cool how it can fold down into aa walker.

3	Or rather, a sentry turret, seeing as it can't really move while in that mode.

3	Still, it's nice.

3	My favourite part is the mini mining robot though.

3	So cute!

3	~Peace

3	Thanks for that interesting review, brickbitz.

3	The alien fighter looks pretty nice, nothing special but streamlined and fast nevertheless.

3	That transforming feature´s a nice addition for sure, and these new flicker missile with its launch apparatus.... hmm, I hope I won´t spend quite some time in search of that little 'rocket' piece....

3	However, there´s still something I miss with these alien crafts....

3	I don´t know....

3	I like some more organic looking design, and they even come in some nice and different shapes, but still.... perhaps a real space fighter just needs a solid cockpit, cool windscreens and controls to satisfy my odd likings.

3	That 'exo suit' looks really good and I wonder why it´s a little underrepresented on the box art.

3	The jet pack/space scooter´s a really good idea, and the only thing I hate´re those darned studless technic beams.... it could look so much better with a studded version of these parts.

3	But of course that´s only due to my personal preferences.

2	Thanks for the review!!

2	That makes me wanting this set even more!

2	!

2	Thanks for the review brickbitz I don't normally come into the space forum but this set it tempting me, on the basis of you review I think I might aquire one at some point.

2	DAMN!!!

2	I was just about to post a review on this Here's the Infiltrator WITH the nice shiny holographic stickers!

2	I was just about to post a review on this Why not.... multiple reviews´re doing no harm, and it´s always interesting to see reviews with a perhaps different point of view too....

3	LOL your sig is awesome!

3	The little power suit is well done, I would like to see articulation some how jammed into the little legs though, and we all now exoforce 4 finger hands would look great on his arms.

3	Edited by Rayskull, 18 May 2008 - 04:51 PM.

3	Thanks for the review nice little set and its around $20.00!

3	Excellent review as usual, brickbitz.

3	I really love this set.

3	The moonwalker is amazing, and the alien craft is really nice too.

3	I might get this someday...

2	I was just about to post a review on this Here's the Infiltrator WITH the nice shiny holographic stickers!

2	Mars_Mis...tor_tiny.JPG There's nothing stopping you from posting a review as well...

2	My first impression upon seeing this set was "no thanks", but now I'm warming up to it.

2	Still, I'll skip it if it interferes with my Hypersonic Operations Aircraft fund.

2	:P

3	Hi y'all!

3	Guess what happened today?

3	When walked into my Toys 'R' Us in Fullerton, CA, just to buy a simple Tiny Turbo racer, what do I see?

3	All the Agents sets sitting on the shelf, ready for the taking!

3	I didn't have too much money with me, so I just got 2 of 8631 Mission 1: Jetpack Pursuit!

3	It's a really cool little set, so I thought I'd review this puppy for you!

3	I shall proceed in the order of the instructions.

3	So, let's get started!

3	The Minifigs Let's begin with the minifigs, Saw Fist and Agent Chase!

3	They are really cool, some of the coolest minifigs I have seen in a while!

3	I took off Saw Fist's wig & chainsaw so you can see his head and cybernetic arm better!

3	Here is a back view of Saw Fist, and - SURPRISE!

3	Agent Chase has a double sided head!

3	One side with his cool "mission face" with sunglasses and headset, and one with his casual Bruce Wayne type face (note, though, that it is not really the Bruce Wayne face).

3	His wig, btw, is Mutt's hairpiece in black!

3	Very neat!

3	Poor Saw Fist seems to be forced to always drag his chainsaw around for it is way too long to just hang down from his shoulder like a normal arm.

3	The Snowmobile Next up, we have the snowmobile, a sleek little vehicle with only minor design flaws!

3	The container with the jewel is attached to the vehicle by a single stud, so it doesn't fall off, but is easy to pick up!

3	In the pic below you can see the only two tiny design flaws: Thanks to the exhaust pipes, the laser cannon (or whatever it's supposed to be) can't be lowered any further than this.

3	Also, the corners of that slope-ish piece that the handle bar rests on are sticking out a little at the sides.

3	Other than that, it's pretty well done!

3	The Jetpack Finally, there is the Jetpack!

3	IMO, a name like Autogyro-pack or something would make more sense, but whatever.

3	Although a little bulky, the Jetpack is very well designed!

3	The rotor can be tilted back, and at the lower back of the Jetpack, there is hook with which you can grab the container with the jewel from the snowmobile.

3	What I like best about the Jetpack is that although it is attached to the minifig in kinda the same way as that of the Riddler, this one doesn't rotate around.

3	So, the Agent is being held in place steadily!

3	"See ya later, chainsaw-cyborg-dude!"

3	Stickers This set comes with a surprisingly large sticker sheet.

3	The reason is that half of it are extra stickers!

3	There are two large Agents logos and one Inferno logo - perfect for Agents MOCs!

3	There are also a star and a small, round sticker portraying the number of the mission.

3	The star seems to be part of some kind of game where you collect the stars from all sets on an Agents ID that you get from the Mission 5 set.

3	I don't know, though, if you get any gain from this except for becoming a full-status Lego Agent!

3	Below, you can find the list of parts from this set!

3	Click here for a better quality pic!

3	That's pretty much it!

3	I hope you liked this review and will run straight to your next toy store to get one or more of this set!

3	This was my very first set review!

3	So any questions, comments, or requests?

3	Any more pics you want me to take?

3	Would you like me to exchange the chainsaw with something else, or do you want me to try the Agent's new hairpiece out on another fig?

3	If so, just tell me!

3	See ya!

3	Edited by Oky Wan Kenobi, 25 June 2009 - 08:21 PM.

3	Thanks for the excellent review Oky!

3	Judging by this set, the line is going to be promising.

3	I really like the figs and I'm glad to see that robot arm is actually a new arm mold.

3	Awesome!!

3	Can a minifig hand fit in the end or just the chainsaw attachment?

3	Could it fit an Exo-Force robot claw?

3	There's a lot of detail in the torsos and I like that the Agent's suit is like a moto-cross uniform.

3	I love that the snowmobile has a working tread.

3	Copmike, Ras and I tried to build a snowmobile with working treads, but we ended up using chainsaw blades in the end.

3	Great work Oky!

2	That's a great review for your first one.

2	I think the jet pack if far to bulky it could do with some minimising but that’s life.

2	I assume that you can’t fit a standard hand in the chainsaw arms are the hole would be to large but would you be so good as to confirm this for me?

2	Overall I quite like the jet ski and the ability to lower the arms to much doesn’t both me.

2	How much was it just so I can get an idea of the price?

2	Finally thanks for posting this review so quickly.

3	This is MUCH MUCH MUCH more promising than the 2008 Batman set for $10.00.

3	The vehicle looks like someone took time to design it, but the Batman one looks like .

3	Lego dear Lego, where is the quality for Batman??!?!

3	I really like the new cyborg arm, and the propellers on that thing : ), it is a really promising line although I would get rid of all those bionicle pieces.

3	Thanks for the great review Oky Wan The two vehicles look quite nice for a small set and the minifigs look great!

3	The two sided head is nice, although it would've been nice if it was a new head rather than the standard frowning face.

3	The cyborg looks good, nice and cartoony, I like the printing on his back.

3	The belt on the hips should be useful, not to mention the robotic hand.

3	I assume that anything that fits into a 1x1x1 cylinder can fit in it?

3	I hope so Thanks again Oky.

3	Any chance you can get any more sets?

2	Thanks for the review.

2	I'm looking forward to some of the new parts and ideas in this line.

2	The figures look great.

2	The actual sets themselves don't really appeal though.

2	This set looks wicked!

2	Thanks very much for the sweet review Oky Wan!

2	The pics are perfect, great quality and the perfect size, well done!

2	This sets got everything, a new hairpiece, tank treads, a gem, well, I could go on but you can all see everything from the great pics.

2	Thanks again Oky!

2	This is one set I'll definately be getting!

2	~Peace

2	Huhm .. i like the idea of the agent-ID .. but offcourse all they want with that is that you buy all six sets .. but it can be a good idea for children, they wouldn't think of "hey they get all money only because i have a little card with stars" or something.

2	Well, not to rant, i think it's good.

2	Also, can you make that name yourself?

2	maybe set 5 comes with a extra stickersheed with all letters, that would be nice "Agent Rupee" A very nice review Oky Wan Kenobi.

2	=Rupee

2	Thanks, guys!

2	I really tried to make it a good first review!

2	Now to answer your questions: The robot arm can fit EF robot claws and anything that a minifig can hold in his hand or that would fit into a 1x1x1 cylinder, so normal minifig hands are too small to fit.

2	TLG is using the robot claw idea for the main villain of the Agents line!

2	Do you still want me to try it out and take pics?

2	The price was 10.99 USD at the TRU I bought it at.

2	I bet it'ss be a dollar less on S@H!

2	And I'm sorry, but I probably won't get any more sets any time soon.

2	I have to save my money for all the other good set that are to come.

2	But if I would get another set, it would just be the one with the helicopter and the all-silver car!

2	If anyone gets this set, can he/she PLEASE review it?

2	Thanks!

2	Any other questions I can answer for you guys?

2	Edited by Oky Wan Kenobi, 18 May 2008 - 08:59 AM.

3	Oky Wan, thanks for this wonderful review!

3	I really have mixed feelings towards Agents set.

3	Haha, but I love the Agent mini-figure.

3	The double-sided face is great and I love the sunglass look.

3	It's nice that they made use of Mutt's hairpiece which is personally my fave hairpiece at the moment The jet-pack is neat.

3	Making use of the additional secure backing onto the mini-fig is really very smart.

3	Nice first review Oky Wan !

3	I´d say this is better than we first thought.

3	The minifigs looks cool and the overall look is ok. And the excaustpipe is a new peace also I think?

3	Agents On copmike

3	I kind of like the set.

3	As said it has a very cartoonish style to it so I'm guessing the kids are going to love it.

3	And as a parent I'll love it if the construction isn't to fragile.

3	;) I'll probably be getting a few for myself but only as parts pack.

3	copmike, on May 18 2008, 11:29 AM, said: And the excaustpipe is a new peace also I think?

3	Yeah and it's all over this years releases.

3	From what I've seen so far it's found in: racers, Speed Racers, Mars Mission and Exo-Force sets.

3	I just wish that instead of a 2x1 plate with an exhaustpipe in each end they would have made it an 1x1 plate with a single exhaust.

3	That would have been a lot more useful.

2	OMG OMG OMG.

2	Im coming to the US in just under two weeks, really hope I see them somewhere!

2	Does anyone know what NY Times Square Toys R Us is like for new sets?

2	Is there any chance u could post pics of the comic and the box i love legos box art and instruction art?

3	I love the way the bad guy has a special attachment on the jewel case JUST to allow the Agent to grab it with his hook.

3	It's like the two of them sat down beforehand and drew up the plans for the vehicle together... CYBORG: "OK, and then I'll make my getaway in the special snowmobile and you can follow me..." AGENT: "...And I'll scoop up the jewel and return it to foil your plan".

3	CYBORG: "Perfect.

3	See you Tuesday?"

3	Dr. S.

1	Good review!

1	Thanks Oky Wan.

1	Hmm, although I really like the villain (not just the new arm, I think the color is very... villanous, as all Bond-villains with class have minions in uniforms.

1	It's even possible to fill out their numbers with Exo-force grunts of the same color) I'm not that hot for the agent himself, his uniform... nah.

1	It doesn't even look like clothes, just give the man a suit or some nifty leather.

1	I think I'll try to grab some sets from the agents line just for the new parts (to begin with... MOCs may follow, who knows?)

1	when they are available in stores here in Sweden.

1	Haven't seen them yet, though Indiana Jones just got here so there might be some further waiting for me.

1	Now I want to see reviews of the other sets :)

2	Thanks for a very good review!

2	Agent line seems better all the time...

2	Looking forward in seeing review on Mission 2 Gold Chase (and new pictures of the jet) really soon!

2	Hmm, interesting set.

2	Great review!

2	I might pick this one up for the wonderful parts.

2	~VBBN~

3	What a lovely set, thanks for that fine review, Oky Wan Kenobi!

3	The MFs´re wonderful, that helipack looks solid and well done and I especially like the slightly asymmetrical design of the neat snowmobile.

3	A very playable little set for sure, and the most interesting part´s for sure that new cool MF arm....

2	They are already on the shelfs?

2	That's kinda weird, since there aren't even the instructions online yet

2	Yay, Oky Wan!

2	Wow, the Agents line is looking good so far.

2	The jetpack is pretty nice, and the minifigs... My dad was in Portland just yesterday, and If I'd have called an hour sooner, he might have been able to get to the TRU...

2	Thanks for the great review Oky Wan!

2	At first I didn't think I liked the Agents sets but the more I see them the better I think they look.

2	I will definitely pick up 1 or 2 of the sets.

2	I really like the jet pack, and the figs look great.

2	That double face is very nice.

2	TLG should make more figs with these faces in my opinion.

2	Great review!Thank youvery much!

2	I think this line is much more promising than most orginally thought it would be.

2	I'm onmy way to see ifican find the big rig right now!

3	Thank you for the nice review.

3	It has some big pieces I don't like, but the minifigs are good.

2	Thank you.

2	Thanks for the review!

2	Do i see a little Indy hint on that map?

2	Oh and btw., the map looks like it actually is printed am i right?

3	Looks good, and I'll bet that jaw and wire could be used for lots of MOCs... Is this the only Agents set that contains the wire?

3	While I'm here: I got the third mission, would anyone like a review of that?

3	Faramir

2	That would be great!

2	I still wonder why the instructions aren't up yet, though..

3	Mmm this set looks amazing.

3	lovely pieces.

3	And I actually like the minifig faces.

3	That Jaw helmet is cool aswel .

3	Are those stickers on the crocodile heads or is it printed?

3	Not many words this time, but as they say: a picture is worth a thousand words - and your pictures are lovely!

3	Once again, Agents is turning out to be a cooler and cooler theme with each new review.

3	This set looks like an awesome parts pack, and I love the bike!

3	BTW, anyone else notice the possibly accidental reference to Alpha Team?

3	Agent Charge is back, it looks!

3	Edited by Grevious, 21 May 2008 - 09:05 PM.

3	Thanks for the review, this set is wonderful!

3	U love the TWO dark green crocodiles and awesome minifigs, especially break jaw That bike is awesome and the base, like all agents sets, comes with great pieces, like the barbed wire, orange anything, leafy pieces and brown log pieces.

3	Thanks for the review, I'll definitely get this one!

3	Batbrick Away!

3	Wow, great review for a really great looking set.

3	The pieces, like the minifigs and crocs are very nice, but that map is reeaally cool for an Aztec/Maya/Inca fan (like me)!

3	I will definately buy this set when it is available in England.

3	Grevious, on May 21 2008, 10:04 PM, said: BTW, anyone else notice the possibly accidental reference to Alpha Team?

3	Agent Charge is back, it looks!

3	Yeah, I thought that.

3	Then I thought, "nah, he looks different", but I remember that the characters in Alpha Team did change their looks a lot throughout the years (being spies and that).

3	Edited by Shoc, 26 May 2008 - 10:37 AM.

3	A really cool playset, thanks for these great pics, SirNadroj!

3	A silver jaw helm, cycrocs, some cool faces and a very swooshable bike.... see you later, alligator!

3	The only thing I don´t get entirely´re these neat barbwire circles.

3	What´s the purpose with these.... life rings for masochists?

3	Well.... that makes me look at that tower in a completely new way too.... baddie´s baywatch on!

3	But where´re the girls?

3	Have you made any other reviews?

3	I want more.

3	Please?

3	I'm not planning to get this set, but its pretty cute.

3	The set itself is okay, but the figs are amazing.

3	Agent Charge: I want that head.

3	Unibrow man!

3	Great villain!

3	Crocs...

3	Great little set, nice to have a small building instead of all vehicles.

3	Plant pieces and dark green crocs always welcome.

3	Good parts selection for the price.

3	Thanks for the review!

3	Can't wait till we can get our hands on these!

3	Like all the others, (except the truck) this set is great.

3	Love the figs and the green crocidiles.

2	Can't..resist...the unibrow...must obey.

3	Nice set... Im definately gonna pick it up when I see it.

3	I like the design of the base and it comes with lots of usefull an neat pieces.

3	Great looking set!

3	I’m determined to get all the Agent sets this summer.

3	Comments: Swamp Tower-The barbed wire is cool, but it seems like it’s only for looks.

3	Bike-Cool looking, but doesn’t seem to have any controls.

3	Cybercrocs-Wow, haven’t seen any of these pieces for a while, and in dark green, awesome!

3	Agent Charge-Sweet head, definitely cool.

3	Break Jaw-He looks like the result of some animal testing on humans gone horribly wrong.

3	I hope they come out near me soon.

3	Wow, thanks for the great review, SirNadroj!

3	The overall set is what attracted me in the first place, that elevated hut and swampy setting just sucked me right in!

3	It all looks really nice to me, a definite buy.

3	That Agents head would make a great Indy, for those opposed to fleshies.

3	And that monobrow, I mean, villain guy looks very... er... well, the monobrow is unique, thought I noticed the suit looks a bit skin tight in the crotchal area.

3	Don't look at me like that, you saw it too!

3	Anyway, the helmet's the best part about the villain, great for Warhammer 40,000 Orks.

3	~Peace

3	Very useful pieces, that new Agent head (I think it's new) could be used for a Gordon Freeman minifigure, and Break Jaw's head for Otis the security guard when you take his donuts away from him.

3	I always joked that our house would have a moat around it with mechanical alligators.

3	Now I can build the house in lego!

3	Thanks SirNadroj for the review and pictures.

3	This is definitely my favorite Agents set.

3	Great review and a good confirmation of exactly what I suspected... this is a parts line for me.

3	Much like Exoforce before it, this will be the theme I pick up when I'm out of other things, or it's on sale.

3	Plus those dark green alligators bring tears of joy to an old pirate.

3	Alice, on May 22 2008, 12:43 AM, said: I always joked that our house would have a moat around it with mechanical alligators.

3	You were joking?

3	What about the monkeys and the miniature golf course?

3	Don't ruin my dreams ...

3	Nice map.

3	Is it a sticker or printed?

3	Steve

3	Thanks for the review.

3	I the bike and the bad guy's helmet.

2	Why do all of the reviews that we have for Agents sets have the agents getting hurt?

2	Is this a new trend?

2	Plus Unibrow man doesn't have a unibrow.

2	His eyebrows are really close together and bushy!

1	Is this a new trend?

1	No, it's an old trend.

1	And it's because villains are cooler.

1	Actually, it could be long-simmering resentment towards the not-highly-regarded Alpha Team/ Dino Attack sets bubbling forth.

1	See Dr Lucky's hilarious post here for an example of what I mean...

1	I'm sure the new agents will learn to fight back soon

2	does anyone know if the turbo car chase is out yet?

3	I've copied another thing because i don't know how i must do a review.

3	And i can't do long reviews!

3	Set ref: 7884 Name: The Buggy: The Escape of Mr Freeze Number of minifigs: 2 Number of pieces: 76 Price: 13,95€ Front of the box: Back of the box: The comic: Very close: What's in the box: Without: The set: The set with the box: The time: Wow, this is a funny set, but it's a little expensive, and a little to small, but i like some pieces like the fire, and the mr freeze gun.

3	And the best of all, here it comes, NO STICKERS!

3	That's one of the greatest things.

3	But i understand why lego has made this set, some people want batman lego, and they are most of the time expensive, and the mr freeze set is also expensive, but this set not.

3	If you want more pics, you msut ask!

3	For exaple for the minifigs, or the mr freeze and the blaster.

3	Ask it, and this is my first review and sorry for the great and blurry pics!

3	The Final Verdict: 7.5/10 Figures: 8/10 Playability: 6/10 Build: 7/10 Pieces: 7.5/10

2	Very nice review Riddler!

2	Thanks for an interesting review, ???theriddler???.

2	The set´s cheap and very useful to get two fantastic MFs, a great Mr.

2	Freeze and a very cool new Batman.

2	But I have to say that these two small vehicles just look plain ugly IMHO, without any inspiration nor orginality....

2	Sorry, TLC, but you can for sure do better than that, and even with less pieces....

3	Nice review, thanks!

3	I really like those little go-kart thingies, they've got a fantastic Mario Kart look to them

2	Thanks for the review... Ill probably get one copy of this set.

2	Mr.

2	Freeze and his cart look neat.

2	I dont like the huge wing on the back of Batman's buggy so Ill probably mod that out.

2	Quote But I have to say that these two small vehicles just look plain ugly IMHO, without any inspiration nor orginality Indead.

2	The only reason to get this set is if you couldn't afford the Batcave back in 2006 and want a Mr.

2	Freeze fig for a cheap price.

2	And anyone who did get that kit really have no reason whatsoever to get this.

2	Wait, did I forget something?

2	Oh yeah - thanks for the review, Riddler.

3	I'll get it, I admit the vehicles are extremely poorly designed, I mean REALLY poorly designed, but the Mr.Freeze fig is fantastic, and I would buy two of this set just for him, as his head and gear are very useful for mocing.

3	It also comes with some nice pieces, like the grappling hook, little wheels, exhaust pieces and such.

3	Still, a pretty bad set build wise, but it has atleast inspired me to make my own Batbuggy Thanks for the review theriddler, appreciated.

3	Batbrick Away!

2	As others have said, this really is a set for those that didn't buy the Batcave.

2	Thus I want it!

2	The cars are pretty horrid though...

2	Thanks for the review ???theriddler???

2	!

2	Thanks for the review!

2	For such a high price that we need to fork out, compared to a total pieces of 76.

2	It's is very expensive to pay for such poor design.

2	But then, I will still considered to get them.

2	As what Sinner had said, this is a very good way to get Mr Freeze without getting the Batcave.

2	And it so happened that, I do not have the Batcave too.

2	I believed that is the cheapest set among the four.

2	So, for the mini-figs ONLY, this set is recommended.

2	Other than that, I am sorry.

1	Like many others, I'll buy this just for Mr F, quickly recycle the parts, and pretend this set never existed.

1	The flame detail is indeed terrible.

1	The Bat is back - and he's flatulent!

1	This third Bat-wave isn't really doing anything for me.

1	I'll get the Penguin set as well for pretty much the same reason - although the sub on that is pretty cool - but skip the others.

1	Maybe Batbrick can make us all nice alt-mocs to improve these sets...

1	Thanks for the review though!

3	Thanks for the review ???theriddler???.

3	This is a neat little set, a bit overpriced in my opinion, but for a new suited Batman and a Mr Freeze fig in a set other than one of the most expensive Bat-sets released, it's worth my money.

3	~Peace

2	WOWIE!!!!!!

2	I'm glad you like it!

2	Maby i'l do the tumbler also!

2	But soon the batcycle and the scuba also come!

2	Pretty nice review for a first time ???theriddler???.

2	Next time though, if your camera has it, use the macro function (little flower icon) and perhaps a tripod.

2	That should get rid of any blur and provide you with better pictures.

2	Apart from that, a good little review.

2	Keep up the good work!

3	Neat little set.

3	I do like the parts a number of hard to find bits all in one pack, depending on how much it costs in USD I'll have to consider it.

3	And while the buggy designs kinda suck, I'm a little happy to see them, its been years since TLC made any small go kart style vehicles.

3	I guess Tiny Turbos have been overshadowing that market?

2	Thanks for the reveiw The figs are bloody great!

2	but those cars are a bit... well I'll put it blantly, RETARDED!!!

2	Although they shall be good after some modding!

2	and whats with that grapple hook?

2	does it even have a rope, so I guess Batman will hokk it to Mr freeze so his ride looks more ugle anyway, can you pleese take some pics of the figs

3	That's a great set.

3	It'd be even better if it were sold as two separate little cars.

3	They remind me of the dozens of little LEGO cart vehicles I got as a kid.

3	Those were always fun, quick builds that resulted in lots of cool play.

3	I think this set is aimed more at kids and, in that respect, it's a pure winner.

3	It doesn't hurt that you can get Freeze and the newly designed Batman both in this set for a reasonable price.

2	And do someone also another review of the 7888, the tumbler?

2	Thank you, The Riddler! )

2	For this highly informative review.

2	Despite the fact that I still consider it to be one of the weakest sets in all Batman Line, I guess that now I may even get more than one of these for the same reasons as Batbrick. )

2	Good day, gentlemen! )

2	Thanks the penguin, and more pics on monday!

1	Thanks for the review.

1	This set was poorly design, when i first heard of it i think it was like a car with a much better design than this one.

1	I think i will get it for the minifigs.

2	The pics as promised.

2	Extra part:

3	Thanks for the extra pics, I don't think you could have gone into much more detail than that!

3	Nice pics of the Joker van too, will you do a review of that one?

3	Batbrick Away!

3	In actuality, I think that this may be my favorite Batman set of all time.

3	I know, I know - it's a small set with crappy tiny vehicles; so it probably sucks for the fan who likes to display sets; but look at the MOCing side and you see this set has a ton of potential: -New Batman fig.

3	Well, mainly the torso; but it looks nice, sleek, and armored!

3	A definite plus whether you're a MOCist or batfan.

3	-Mr.

3	Freeze.

3	Because nobody bought the Batcave when they should have...and by nobody I mean me.

3	Plus, I love that head!

3	-Cheapest way to amass the lightning piece.

3	The other sets that have it are lolhueg (Well, not really, but I don't have $50 to toss around on a little skeleton tower...), and it's a great piece.

3	-Two little blue gems.

3	I may be alone on this, but those are my favorite parts (the gems), and that's my favorite color for them!

3	<3 <3 <3 -Several other useful parts, including a +O piece in black, some light/medium blue bits from Mr.

3	Freeze's kart, the oddly placed grappling hook, and some cheap wheels.

3	Now, I don't know about you guys, but this is as close to a Batman Battlepack as we're going to get, lol - I'm buying at least three, maybe more once I get my summer job ^.^ (Oh, and the fact that the US price is only $10 helps a little, but this year you guys can't complain - you got practically every set first, ESPECIALLY the new castle!

3	T.T) ~Trexxen

1	Thanks for the review.

1	I dont know if I would get this set though.

1	The cars are not that great and the price is a little too high.

1	I got this yesterday and built it this morning.

1	Apart from the figs, it is very crappy.

1	Mr Freeze's buggy is OK but the bat buggy is easily the worst vehicle I've seen for years.

1	Colours are all over the place, the grappling hook feels cheaply made, the inclusion of those odd pearl silver parts which have been in the Exo-Force sets seem especially random here, the terrible Bionicle flame piece...

1	It's the first Lego vehicle I've built where I've immediately had the urge to disassemble it and pretend I never bought it!

1	Really, I only got it for Mr Freeze so I shouldn't complain.

1	But still.

1	It's a real step backwards.

1	The comparable Catwoman dragster set was heaps better.

1	The Penguin sub is sweet though Thanks for the review anyway!

3	Coming in at around $50 US, Turbo Car Chase is one of the bigger of the new Agents sets.

3	A big box with a helicopter, car, and gate in it.

3	Seems like a winner, but how good is it really, and is it worth the cash?

3	Let's start with the Minifigs.

3	This set comes with a standard Inferno Henchman, Spy Clops, and Agent Chase.

3	The Henchman is you basic LEGO criminal type with a gun and a jumpsuit, nothing real groundbreaking here.

3	Spy Clops, on the other hand, is very cool for, technically, half of a Minifig.

3	His head has a neat electronic goggle print and the rest of him is a torso mounted onto a set of six legs made from Exo-Force robot arms.

3	The whole thing is really well done and neat as hell.

3	Agent Chase (Turbo Car Chase! )

3	seems to have a standard agent body and a double-printed face with one side a sunglasses and headset print.

3	The other face is a determined Agent look.

3	The set also includes a laptop with Doctor Inferno wallpaper.

3	The laptop is a new piece and works like the LEGO books that are in a lot of Harry Potter sets.

3	Molding on the keyboard is really well done and the thing can be held by a Minifig along either corner, but not in the middle and not while closed.

3	The gate in the set is nothing revolutionary by itself, and I sort of get the feeling that it was included to drive up the piece count and the set price point.

3	That being said, there are some things to like here.

3	For instance, the gate has four wheels of barbed wire attached to it.

3	The barbed wire is new and makes me want to start building some World War I trench MOCs.

3	The rest of the gate is fairly big and it has a handy ramp attached so that vehicles can roll through it easily.

3	The main feature of the gate is a sound brick.

3	It's much better then LEGO sound and light units of the past, when the gate is opened it depresses a button and an alert klaxon blares that sounds every bit like a prison-beak in progress.

3	The triggering action works surprisingly well and it's pretty much for this feature alone that I'm not going to immediately break the gate back down and add it to my parts bin.

3	The designers did make an effort to create more then just a fence though.

3	A nice control panel connected to a big spotlight crowns the piece, and a pair of cameras watch the opening.

3	It's really hard to mess up a LEGO helicopter, and this set is no exception.

3	The Inferno Chopper is a nicely proportioned and well built machine.

3	It looks properly menacing and has the uniform orange and black of other Inferno property.

3	It's armed with a set of four Technic pegs cleverly used as guns on outriding mounts, as well as a pair of the newer-style flick-fire missiles.

3	I personally don't care for flick-firing missiles, but these look decent enough and seem to stay put so I really can't complain about them.

3	Along the fuselage are a pair of intake pieces that I've never seen before and I'm guessing are new.

3	They're pretty well designed and will come in handy for MOCing down the road.

3	The action feature of the aircraft is the wench system.

3	This is very different then other LEGO wenches in that you build the entire mechanism and housing.

3	You can then use it to raise Spy Clops up and down from the bottom of the chopper using the rotor.

3	Now, this also keeps you from sitting there and just giving the rotor repeated spins to simulate flight.

3	I'm not too thrilled with that, but there are a hundred other LEGO helicopters out there with fully rotating rotors, so I guess I can let it by just this once.

3	As you'd suspect, the bottom of the cockpit is completely open, which makes this a vehicle pretty much solely for Spy Clops (Sorry Henchman).

3	But there is plenty of room beneath the body to attach a plate with some seats on it to accommodate another pilot without drastically altering the design, or even removing existing pieces.

3	The Turbo Car is a slick little honey of a LEGO car, and the silver pieces that make up the body work contribute a lot to that fact.

3	The front license plate appears to be an Exo-Fore code brick.

3	But it also hides the activation lever for the passenger ejector seat.

3	The seat works about as well as the Spruce Goose, which is to say not well at all, but here it's the thought that counts.

3	The interior of the car is really well done.

3	There's even a radar screen for keeping track of pesky helicopters.

3	But the Bond-like features don't end there.

3	A lever in the compartment raises pair of guns in the hood and a knob on the rear deploys a quad rocket system with more flick-fire missiles.

3	This is a car that won't be stopped easily!

3	The rear has two cones sticking out.

3	I'd like to think they're smoke nozzles or oil-slick sprayers.

3	All-in-all, this is a really good set.

3	The car is pure LEGO vehicle love and looks fantastic.

3	The silver pieces are very nice and it's a shame LEGO doesn't use metallic colors in System sets more often.

3	There are, however, a LOT of sticker for this set and I know how much that bugs a lot of people.

3	I personally like how much detail the stickers add to these sets and don't mind them so much.

3	The set also comes with an Agents ID card for Chase which you can put little star stickers on from other sets as you get them.

3	It's printed on a real nice piece of sturdy plastiboard and would be cooler if you could put your own picture and name on it instead of pretending to be Chase.

3	Sold by themselves, the car and chopper would be must-haves.

3	All tossed together with the gate sort of makes the set a little less then the sum of it's parts.

3	And with 498 parts (most of them small) that's not so hot.

3	It's only slightly over-priced in my opinion, but if you do shell out the money you won't regret it.

3	I'm very comfortable recommending this set to anyone.

3	Close to perfect, but the price and some minor flaws bring it back just a little.

3	I'd say 4.33, but out of 5 is close enough!

3	Looks cool, one of the best in this line.

3	Cant wait for review!

3	Chrome..... Can't wait for the review, Deino!

3	can't wait for the review the car is ly!!

3	!

3	Deinonychus, on May 23 2008, 10:12 PM, said: Pics and thoughts tomorrow!

3	I picked up this set earlier in the week and was quite pleased with it (in fact I have missions 1-5 and am happy with all of them - this series is much better than the old Alpha Team ever was).

3	I look forward to reading your thoughts on it.

3	I will say 2 things about it now though.

3	1)My set came with defective instructions.

3	In 2 places pages are missing and duplicates of other pages repeated.

3	For instance, the car instructions are missing steps 16-21.

3	Fortunately, I was able to make out what pieces went where in the missing steps by studying the illustration in step 22.

3	I hope you have better luck with your instructions.

3	2)This set contains the best LEGO sound brick ever (it's just begging to be incorporated into my Arkham Asylum).

2	Yay!

2	Can't wait for your review.

2	I plan to get this and the giant truck.

2	The Brick Rat, on May 23 2008, 07:31 PM, said: 2)This set contains the best LEGO sound brick ever (it's just begging to be incorporated into my Arkham Asylum).

2	What is a sound brick?

2	Mr. Mandalorian, on May 24 2008, 11:58 AM, said: What is a sound brick?

2	Ditto.

2	Maybe its like the Exo-Force light-up brick, only with sound instead of light.

2	That would kick [INNAPROPRIATE WORD DELETED].

2	Sounds like you just ran into some bad luck there, my friend.

2	Quote 2)This set contains the best LEGO sound brick ever (it's just begging to be incorporated into my Arkham Asylum).

2	I agree 100%.

2	And I didn't even see it had a sound brick until I read this last night.

2	Usually LEGO promotes stuff like that pretty loudly on the packaging.

2	Not here though.

3	WOW!

3	Thanks, Deino, for this great review!

3	I can't wait to get this myself, but right now I gotta save for the CW sets!

3	The car is with no doubt one of the most mind blowing things TLG has come up with and we can only hope that there will be more models made out of almost only metalic colors!

3	The spider cyborg, while not as innovative as some of the other cyborgs, is a very nice fig, and his head will be very usefull for Splinter Cell MOCs!

3	And those intake pieces are only relatively new btw, they are in almost all of the current $10 Racers sets.

3	Any chance of you taking a pic of a line-up of all the silver parts in this set?

3	Edited by Oky Wan Kenobi, 24 May 2008 - 11:32 PM.

3	Great review, Deino!

3	Man, that car is just so beautiful, and the helicopter is nice too.

3	Unfortunately, this seems pretty pricy, and I hardly think I'll be getting it any time soon, what with my limited budget and all.

3	Still, it's great to see how well Agents is shaping up.

3	I love it !

3	Fun, playable, cool looking, and killer minifigs!

3	Sweet!

3	Thanks for the review Deino!

3	I love going back through the old "Agents" thread just to see how wrong we were about these awesome sets!

3	I actually really like the gate, those portcullis pieces people may know i always find nice uses for, and I really, really, really want that awesome sound brick.

3	The figs are a bit disappointing in numbers, but agent Chase is very cool, generic henchman are great, and Spy Clops is one of my favourite minifigs ever!

3	The helicopter is wonderful too, I love that it is customised for Spy clops to winch him down.

3	The colours as usual for these sets are fantastic, the dark blue, orange and chrome silver!

3	The car is the best though, I love all the functions.

3	How does the ejector seat work though?

3	Batbrick away!

3	Wow, thanks for the great review Deino This set is really a must have for me.

3	The sound brick seems great, the helicopter looks very nice and the car is superb!

3	All of the James Bond features are really cool, though I'm very interested in how the ejector seat works (or doesn't work..).

3	The car itself is very sleek and full of beautiful silver, and the inclusion of the new rims and windshield mean that I won't have to buy many Speed Racer sets.

3	As for the minifigs, they all look great, especially SpyClops.

3	Though it looks rather easy for him to fall off of his spider legs.

3	Can you confirm this?

3	A great review of a great set, thanks Deinonychus

3	Thanks for the awesome review, Deinonychus!

3	This really is a sweet set, a bit expensive a set for me, as I only get the cheaper non-Castle sets, which is a shame because I love that head!

3	It would be great for some more cyborg troops.

3	The car is awesome, I didn't expect it to have that many silver parts, that's fantastic!

3	Heaps of play features too, that ejector seat mechanism sounds interesting.

3	Thanks again for the sweet review!

3	~Peace

2	I'd like to think they're smoke nozzles or oil-slick sprayers.

2	According to page 14 of my BrickMaster magazine, the left cone is for smoke screen and the right cone is for oil slick.

3	Wow great review thanks!

3	This set looks absolutely great!!!!

3	But I'm afraid of the price Oh weel I'll just get the 2 smaller ones.

3	I'm really liking this theme!

3	Well done TLG

2	ES.JPG 47.94K 110 downloads The ejector seat A long Technic axle runs the length of the front of the car.

2	It comes in to the seat area here and nests into the gray joint which is attached to the small gray Technic beam.

2	The beam is attached to the ejector seat (bottom white 3x2 plate) with a Technic pin.

2	The seat, in turn, is attached to the side of the car with a Technic pin.

2	The result is, when the axle is pushed forward, the gray joint and beam tilt the seat and "eject" a Minifig.

2	After about 20 shots the Minifig only went outside of the car 3 times...the rest of the time he just bounced around the inside of the car.

2	So they get an A for effort, but an F for execution

3	Thanks Deinonychus for another great review.

3	I must say I do look forward to people uploading reviews of new sets, it really helps me decide if I want it or not.

3	If it's a good set (IMO) then it adds to the excitement of picking up one myself!

3	This, I must say, is one of those sets!

3	The only concern for me, like alot of others, is the price.

3	I will just have to wait and see and continue to look at these photo's Deinonychus has provided for us!!

3	So much for thinking the Agent line was going to be weak!

3	I wonder if the ExoForce style code brick number plate is a hint from TLC as to what will replace ExoForce at the end of this year?

3	JB

3	Thanks for the great review!

3	I'm really liking these agents sets the more i see them.

3	The car seems to have alot of features.

3	Its to bad the the ejection seat doesn't work as well as one would hope.

3	Oh well.

3	Makes me want the big rig even more now!

2	Looking closely at the red cones on the missles, and grey cones on the car's rear These appear to be a new piece.

2	Note how there is a slight stopper ridge at the base of their top stud.

2	Interestingly, the trans green cones on the helicopter seem to be of the older mould style.

3	Thanks for your great review!

3	It looks very nice indeed!

3	The gate have very interesting mechanism.

3	The car looks very slick and cool.

3	It looks like those typical kind of James Bond car.

3	This review gives me very good insights.

3	Great review deinonychus I really like it!

3	can someone record the sound os the sound brick(maybe on youtube?)

3	I really want to hear it.

3	This sets are really cool deino can you post a picture of the agent card it comes with?

3	Great review and fantastic pics, Deinonychus.

3	And a big thank you to whoever pointed out that you could use the sound brick for Arkham Asylum, my addled brain didn't make the connection.

3	The car is just beautiful, and with a good use for the most expensive part of the gate, this is on my wish list for sure, just have to see how much cash is left over after buying the new death star in a month or two.

3	Agents has to be the biggest surprise from Lego for ages, without any pics it sounded so-so, but they've done a brilliant job with it, love those metallic coloured pieces!

3	great w, im totaly gonna buy this set

3	Great Review Thanks for sharing

3	Hello all Eurobricks members, I will present to you a very short review on the recent Castle Battlepacks.

3	This time, I will be reviewing Skeleton Battlepack, and I hope everyone of you do enjoy viewing it.

3	This was a request that put up by hollisbrick in the Castle thread.

3	Initally, I thought it was a very simple set to do a review.

3	However, for the love of Castle, I decided to whip this up for every Castle fan out there.

3	This is an image of how the Skeleton Battlepacks look like.

3	I have bought 12 last packs of these in total so far but none of the Crown battlepacks yet.

3	There were snapped much faster, that I imagined.

3	Do pardon me for the poor lightning.

3	Today is a bad weather, it's hard to get natural light.

3	The Skeleton Gang For a single battlepack like this, with an attractive reasonable price.

3	You obtained a series of 5 skeleton mini-figs with tons and tons of useful castle accessories.

3	To me, it's a very very great buy, and it's a MUST to stock up for my army building!

3	Some add-ons!

3	However, I was not very satisfied with my Skeleton armies standards.

3	Therefore, I decided to make some slight modifications with some additional castle accessories that is stocked in my Castle warehouse.

3	After the makeover, Ok, this is what I called a real skeleton army.

3	This is mainly my opnion and it have to be aligned with my standards.

3	I felt this improved battlepack gives a punch to the exisitng battlepack.

3	The two soliders on the right, is able to align with the rest of my Castle Chess sets armies.

3	While the one on the left, it gives me a great archer back up with the quiver and helmet attached to him.

3	The ones, on the center especially the armored guard which equipped with the black nose cone helmet is my fave.

3	It is able to illustrate the "Elite" among the rest of the guards with its armor and helmet which was featured in my Castle Deep Forest Expansion MOC..

3	Promotion On!

3	In addition, the one which was hastly done with a modify mace, it looks rather simple.

3	In time to come, I will change it and gives a better equipment and look.

3	These are the remains.

3	I can use the axe for my dwarf in my dwarf mine defender.

3	In that set, there is no weapon for my dwarf and I have to get it from other sets.

3	The rest of the accessories, makes a very good stock up for future upgrading!

3	Overall: 9/10 This is not a playset.

3	It is mainly bought for its abilty to mass recurit any armies, and is a main love for all Castle Army builders such as me!

3	This set mainly have no major faults, and I love it so much.

3	Although, I have done some slight modifciations, but this set is a must for me to buy more and more!

3	Meanwhile, I will need to wait for the next shipment!

3	Hope everyone have enjoying viewing this simple review of mine!

3	Edited by WhiteFang, 25 May 2008 - 12:52 PM.

3	Thanks for the review WhiteFang.

3	I love these sets, and I wish they were available in NZ.

3	So far, it seems they may never come here...

3	But I can sit and hope.

3	I like the look of them after your make-over, a real skeleton army there!

3	Did you say you've bought 12!

3	Tht's lots of Skelies.

3	Are you planning a big MOC or something?

2	No problem!

2	I had bought it last month.

2	I thought it was so simple to do a review for this.

2	Was looking through the thread, then I realised there is a request for it.

2	It was an unexpected shipment that send to Singapore.

2	It came in very limited quantity.

2	Most of the battlepacks were snapped within a day or two when it arrived.

2	Well, I am thinking of building something big in the future.

2	It's just a plan that I have not decided yet.

2	For me, I always love to see the beauty of a big army with different battalions, forming a kingdom.

2	That's why, I always buy many many sets that have figures that attracts me.

2	And for this battlepack, it served a very good purpose for it!

3	Thanks for the review!!!

3	It wasn't "really" a request but more of an imply to do it Anyway great review!

3	Can't wait til these come to Aus.

3	probably when the rest of the castle comes out in September though

3	Thanks for the review I wanted to see what was in this set looks good!

3	Is it sold in stores?

1	How the Megablok does Lego price its items .

1	I'm gonna have to skip this set, and a few others that I wanted because of this bloody outrageous.

1	Back on topic thanks for the detailed review, Whitefang I also like your little changes to the set they really make this set look better.

3	Thanks, WhiteFang!

3	Castle Battle Packs.... simply wonderful!

3	Finally a dream came true, well done TLC!

3	Thanks Whitefang!

3	I love this battlepack, but can only really hope to get one.

3	still, great accesories and a spider!

3	That's great!

3	Guess then, we will have to wait till September 08. mammymarf, on May 25 2008, 11:37 PM, said: Thanks for the review I wanted to see what was in this set looks good!

3	Is it sold in stores?

3	Yes, I have bought these from stores in my country.

3	However, it came in limited quantity and it was snapped out within moments.

3	MacK, on May 26 2008, 12:47 AM, said: I wish these battlepacks had a reasonable price click here to see the Canadian price of these battlepacks, 18 dollars thats 6 dollars more than the Starwars battlepack yet you get the same amount of Lego (or Less then a Starwars battlepack).

3	How the Megablok does Lego price its items .

3	I'm gonna have to skip this set, and a few others that I wanted because of this bloody outrageous.

3	Back on topic thanks for the detailed review, Whitefang I also like your little changes to the set they really make this set look better.

3	MacK, I am glad you liked the little changes I made.

3	Yes, the price for the battlepacks is a little steep.

3	However for the amount of mini-figs and castle accessories, the price and quantity justifiy my bulk purchase.

3	This is one way to acquired soldiers without spending much money on other sets.

3	In this way, you will save much more.

3	I understand the concern of Star Wars Battlepacks from your country.

3	But in my country, Star Wars battlepacks are priced much much higher than the Castle Battlepacks.

3	Castle Battle Packs.... simply wonderful!

3	Finally a dream came true, well done TLC!

3	Asuka, I agreed with you totally.

3	This is indeed a dream come true!

3	Batbrick, on May 26 2008, 06:59 AM, said: Thanks Whitefang!

3	I love this battlepack, but can only really hope to get one.

3	still, great accesories and a spider!

3	That's great!

3	Batbrick Away!

3	Batbrick, you MUST get one of these packs.

3	I am sure it will help you in your Batman Medival MOCs.

3	There are many possibilites for you to play around and custom with your mini-figs.

3	This battlepack, and of course Crown battlepack too, will prove useful to you.

1	No offence- make this 7.99 CAN.

1	Too expensive to be coming with only a few figures.

1	20$ earns you the same amount of figs, plus a catapult, barricade, two horses and a jousting divider.

2	Are you refering to these following sets?

2	Both these sets adds up to $18.00 (CAD) And the skeleton pack have the same price of $18.00 (CAD) *prices quoted from S@H I understand that 7009 and 7090 offers more pieces, horses and same amount of mini-figs compared to a typical battlepack.

2	IMO, I feel that all 3 sets are all army building sets.

2	7009 offer small catapult, 3 mini-figs, a skeleton white horse.

2	7090 offer a joust divider, weapon rack (good accessories), 2 mini-figs, a horse with barding and a skeleton black horse.

2	These sets have different purpose.

2	For me, buying multiples of 7009 is to build its catapult, white skeleton calvaries.

2	While 7090 is to build on Crown calvaries and Black skeleton calvaries.

2	However, Battlepacks have a different agenda.

2	It offered some castle accessories that is not available commonly.

2	For a Castle army builder like myself, castle accessories are always in demand.

2	The black robe, silver armor, silver short-axe are not very common castle accessories.

2	It can be used as a good stock up too.

2	I am not saying this battlepack is an one way solution to solve everything.

2	That's why, different sets are released to target on different purposes.

2	WhiteFang, although I realize that the battle packs are great specifically for building armies, and castle accessories (which is why its such a shame that I won't be able to buy these things ), while sdpirate's sets are more for a catapult, Calvary whatever.

2	The fact to the matter is with the battle pack you get: 5 minifigs with lots of accessories.

2	While with the sets that sdpirate showed us you get: 5 minifigs with an okay amount of accessories 3 horses (including two skeleton ones) A ballista A weapons rack, and a jousting barricade.

2	You cannot say that the battle pack contains the same amount of stuff that the other two sets have and therefore should be priced the same.

2	It just seems that Lego is ripping off Canadian army builders, to me if the battle pack contained a small catapult, or wall so that it contained about the same amount of stuff that the other sets had it would be fair.

2	It seems stupid that you will only get minifigs from one set, while you can get about the same amount of minifigs plus a bunch of other stuff from two other equally priced sets.

2	That’s why to me these battle packs are a rip off, because of what they contain, IMHO the Battle Packs seem to be only worth about 10 dollars.

3	Thanks for the review Whitefang!

3	Your additions look great, I like your mace much better than the use of a small technic cog, your looks much sturdier.

3	And that helmet looks really great on skellie soldiers, I never thought to use that before.

3	Very cool indeed!

1	MacK, I can understand your concern when pricing is concerned.

1	Pricing is always a big issue for us to determine whether to buy or not to buy a certain set in a particular country.

1	Pricing varies differently across different countries such as US, Europe, Canada, Australia and etc.

1	This is something very hard for us to decide on.

1	We can't be sure why TLC placed their pricing strategies this way.

1	Well, I think we should appericate what TLC is trying to do for us, by not using price as the only factor to judge whether to buy this set or not.

1	At least, I am sure there are many of us trying to request for battlepacks to muster armies for their MOCs, Armies Collection and etc.

1	Different people have different judgements towards different sets and different themes.

1	I respect your opnion.

1	IMO, let's don't let price be the only determined factor to decide whether to purchase a particular set or not.

1	Instead, consider an array of factors that is offered.

1	However, I do know that consumers like me and you are always affected by price.

1	iamded, I am glad you enjoyed the review and my slight modifications.

1	That mace was a much looking weapon.

1	It looks much firm than the orignal look.

1	The design was inspired from Dwarf Mine and Dwarf Mine Defender.

1	I would not want to have so many troll flags hanging around.

1	The nose cone helmet, was to give the soliders a whole new look.

1	To me, it retains the classic look, yet it belongs to present theme, suitable for my Skeleton Elite Guards.

2	Thanks for sharing these close-up images of this battlepack WhiteFang.

2	I actually had this set in my hand at Legoland Cal.

2	and could not decide if I wanted it.

2	I'm currently out of "castle-mode" with my large Indy Jungle set up on the table, and creating Ghost Train MOCs that are starting to line up on the bookshelves.

2	Once I buy the Troll Ship, I'll want to start collecting these great fig sets.

2	Thanks again for sharing.

2	Thanks for the nice review WhiteFang!

2	I got the Knights BP just for the scared face.

2	Sorry to be going a little off topic here but personally i have just bought 40 crowny battle packs for the only reason that i am running out of space to store the left over blocks.

2	About 500 of my crownies came from sets (mentioned above) on sale which would have been cheaper than the battle packs.

2	Thanks for the review Whitefang but i dont think i will be buy any skeleton battle packs, that army is large enough.

2	For those of you who buy so many of this and the other battle pack with Crownies, what do you do with all of them?

2	Is this simply to create a large-scale army, or do you plan to build large castle scenes with all the figs.

2	I'd love to see some pictures (on the "share your castle army" thread).

3	Time is a huge factor at the moment, i have to work so hard to pay for all this..lol.

3	There is a Queens birthday holiday coming up on the 9th of june here in australia, thats the deadline i have given myself.

3	You will definately see my army in the "share your castle army thread".

2	Brickster, you should try and get back into "castle-mode".

2	There are so many great stuffs waiting for you such as Dwarf Mine, Tower Raid and etc.

2	However, I can understand that the problem of space is always the key issue.

2	Without space, it is hard for us to keep it on display for big-scale MOCs or for storage purpose.

2	I will be waiting for you to get your Troll Warship too.

2	Hope one day soon enough, we will be able to view a Castle MOC from you too.

2	For me, I will use these battlepack for army building purpose.

2	I always feel that every kingdom needs a considerable amount of soldiers to defend their kingdom.

2	Therefore, most of the time, the amount of soldiers will dictate how strong that kingdom is in my collection.

2	In the future, I hope to build large castle scenes, combined all playsets, armies everything together and developed a kingdom scene.

2	Of course, that is just a dream for now.

2	I am still currently not able to afford much space and time to do such big scale project at the moment.

2	Meanwhile, for this great castle theme, I am storing them at the moment and take it out when the time is ripe.

2	One day soon, I hope I can post an image or two of my armies.

1	I don't think these new skeletons do it for me, but thanks for a good review

3	Hi gang!

3	As you all know, Indiana Jones IV has just debuted, and TLG has released a set depicting the Incan temple (7627) from the film's climax.

3	But Lego beat Harrison Ford, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and company to the punch by nine whole years with Johnny Thunder's adventures in the Amazon Ancient Ruins.

3	The Vitals: Year of release: 1999 Parts Count: 453 MSRP: $80.00 The set included eight figures: (from left) Two skeletons, Dr.

3	Lightning, Gail Storm, Gabarros, Achu, Johnny Thunder, and Señor Palomar.

3	On the far right is my new sigfig, el Conde Voltio Villar.

3	Construction begins with Dr.

3	Lightning and his jeep.

3	It's a sturdy Adventurers-style vehicle, with fatter tires at the rear for better traction.

3	Next is Gabarros and his unusual boat.

3	The hull is from Belleville/Paradisa sets, where it is usually pink or white.

3	TLG ought to have put it in the Pirate theme, as it is a nice, intermediate size.

3	In this set, it is a small steamship.

3	The temple is built on modular 8x8 green bricks which fit into square holes in the baseplate.

3	This is the "treasure room."

3	This square has a nasty double-spear trap.

3	Careful...

3	This is the top section of the temple, crowned by Achu the (mummified?)

3	Incan.

3	More modular sections (these are from the front of the temple site, across the river from the main building).

3	El Conde: "You are too beautiful a woman to be wandering alone in the jungle, Miss Storm.

3	Please, allow me to accompany you."

3	Gail Storm: "I'm with Johnny, and I have a cutlass."

3	El Conde: "I'll be on my way."

3	Here's the finished temple, with all parts in place.

3	Now for the traps... "Hmm, a giant ruby to bring home to the king."

3	"¡Uf!"

3	"That was embarassing.

3	Miss Storm saw me fall..." "And now I've fallen again!"

3	"I had better rest here before something worse happens."

3	"¡Chispas!"

3	"That's it, I'm leaving this place!"

3	"Why me?

3	Why?"

3	The Verdict: This is a fine set, a set whose bare parts/price ratio does not accurately reflect the intricacy of its design nor the rarity of its parts.

3	I had to buy replacements for some of them, and let me tell you, they are PRICEY!

3	That green baseplate?

3	$14.

3	The little dark gray saucepan near the fire?

3	Not available on Bricklink at any price.

3	The brown boat hull?

3	VHTF.

3	With this set, parts quality trumps parts quantity.

3	And the minifigures are wonderful!

3	There's not a dud in the bunch with the possible exception of the very common Dr.

3	Lightning, and even he is not bad.

3	When you factor in the coherence of the color scheme and the brilliant traps, it is obvious that 5986 is a classic.

3	10/10 Edited by WhiteFang, 27 November 2008 - 05:33 AM.

3	This review is added to the index.

3	I've always wanted to see this set close-up Voltio.

3	Thanks for sharing the image review.

3	This is the only Jungle Adventurers set I don't have and it's got some great unique pieces (esp.

3	those leaf brick pieces).

3	What's great is they're not stickers.

3	This is a really a nice review of a neat set; with the extra little humor you shared.

3	Thanks again for taking the time to photograph and share over EB.

3	Great review for a great set!

3	Man I loved the Adventurers Although the new Indy sets are good they will never match up to Johnny Thunder!

3	Most of all no stickers great review!

3	Thanks for this great review, voltio!

3	I never knew of this set 'till now, and it really looks great!

3	I never paid much attention to those Aztec/Incan style sets, which I now regret.

3	I love the bright colours used here, and all the great traps, there's so many of them, which is exactly what we can expect from an old Incan temple like this one.

3	I'm surprised there's no catapult.

3	Anyway, the minifigs included are also great, and am I right in guessing those bricks are printed?

3	That would be fantastic, as they look amazing.

3	That boat hull is new to me too, although I guess the fact that it's mainly in Belville sets explains that pretty well.

3	Thanks again for the sweet review, do you have any other Jungle Adventurers sets you plan to review?

3	~Peace

3	I'm gonna start searching Ebay!

3	I've always wanted this set, ever since it came out in '99.

3	I have never seen it close up (unless you count driving over it in Lego Racers 2), so thanks for the pictures and the great review.

3	Hehe.

3	A real classic, thanks for that nice and funny review, voltio!

3	A well designed set, very playable with a lot of nifty traps, a very good use of that raised baseplate and really nice crafts.

3	The MF characters´re excellent too!

3	And although the color scheme´s great and original, especially with all these neat printed pieces, it´s perhaps the only part of that set that looks a little out of date today....

3	Nevertheless, the set´s plain charming and shows clearly that TLC don´t need licenses to do some distinct Adventurer sets.

3	Great Review.

3	I saw the instructions of this set, but never atracted me Until now A great set an a excelente review.

3	Thanks for reviewing this rare set!

3	Since it came out in 1999 I have only seen this set in a toystore one single time, one single copy as well...

3	It was in the summer of 1999 in Belgium (Arlon) in a store called 'Maxi Toys' (Belgiums TRu, I think).

3	They had the three biggest Junglesets for sale there: these Ancient Ruins, The set with the beautiful black boat and the zeppelin.

3	Being into Adventurers at that time I had never seen the entire Jungle theme (not even in a leaflet or catalog) and surprised as I was I bought all three sets.

3	That was one happy Dutch boy in Belgium!

3	Surprisingly the two smallest sets made it in very small quantities to my local stores in Holland (except for the pontoon plane and small raft which was my very first Shop at Home order).

3	The spider's secret I bought off BL, which makes me the proud owner of the entire Jungle Serie.

3	Back to the set: This was the first time in a long history of collecting Lego that I had a deformed piece: an 2x8 red plate was twisted, I twisted it back and it still serves it's purpose...

3	I loved the whole steam-idea in this Jungle serie: the two boats both (including the one in this set) had nice steamengines and a very cool mechanic (yours has the wrong hat/hair btw) to come along with them.

3	The skeleton falling down on the end of a chain was the most intriguing part of this set for me, it worked really well and when you were done scaring minifigures you could winch it up again ready for the next go.

3	The only thing I did not really like about this set was the difference in wheelsize on the car, front small, back large and the way the palmtree consisted out of just three parts... All in all a great set that is becoming more rare and expensive as we speak/post.

3	Get it!

3	Edited by simonwillems, 26 May 2008 - 07:59 PM.

3	Great review!

3	I just barly missed the Jungle series, growing up with half a year of Jungle and mainly Orient Expedition and Dino Island.

3	I like Egypt more, but this set (despite the 4x4 palm tree) is practically perfect.

3	I love the detail and vibrant colours.

3	Gotta say, I've got a thing for Pippin Reed myself.

3	By the way, what does "VHTF" mean?

3	Edited by sdpirate, 28 May 2008 - 01:06 AM.

3	VHTF= Very Hard to Find.

3	To answer some earlier replies... No, there are no stickers in this set.

3	While some Adventurers sets of the era had stickers (the 5956 Zeppelin had tons), all of the interesting mesoamerican designs from this set are printed.

3	Also, simonwillems was correct; my mechanic is missing his hat, which should be a black kepi.

3	They're extremely expensive on BL, though (proving once again that this set has some awesome parts), so I ordered a replacement from Lego.

3	It's in the mail and should come soon.

1	The printed pieces are the real gems of this set.

1	Beyond them, there isn't much to this set, though the boat hull is nice.

1	The model itself, isn't all that great.

1	The new Akator temple is definately a superior model (at least in piece count), but those printed pieces are hard to resist.

1	Steve I have to agree.

1	Too few pieces for such a high price- but amazing figs too, and a nice baseplate!

1	Despite a 4+ palm tree, you get more palm tree leaves for MOC's.

1	Plus, I think a monkey?

1	And that sweet Achu figure.

3	I absolutly love this set.

3	This is in my opinion the best Adventurers set.

3	It has it all; the falling bridge, the falling skeleton, the spear trap, and the classic trapdoor.

3	It is a must-have set.

3	Thanks for providing such a nice review.

3	this set is awesome .......... gr8

3	I just rebuilt this entire set today, and the nostalgia was totally worth taking bits and pieces from a few of my own MOCs.

3	Only now did I realize how rare some of those pieces are, and I'm rather thankful that I have all of the printed pieces, and Achu.

3	The only pieces I am missing is a transparent orange headlight (3 out of 4), black minifigure hammer, light gray chain(replaced it with a dark gray chain), and ONE WHOLE minifigure, which is the mechanic guy.

3	I still have both the instructions and the box, and both are in appalling conditions.

3	Kudos to the pre-2000s lego sets like this one!

3	Love 'em

3	Wow, good review!

3	I used to love this old sets, as I was greatly fascinated by Inca and Aztec cultures, and the Mayans technological marvels astounded me.

3	I was thrilled to death when Lego released little Aztec figures, so of course I jsut HAD to buy some Your narration with the sig fig was hilarious, and the review was all around wonderful, keep up the good work mate!

3	Thanks for the awesome review Voltio.

3	El Conde is the man!

3	Great review Voltio, I never actually owned this set but my friend does, He gave me some of the peices, but he burnt the base (don't know why)

3	I got this as a birthday gift when I turned 7 years old or so.

3	I can still remember the big box with the brown bridge in its display!

3	So many hours of fun.

3	One of the most amazing sets I own.

3	A lot of play value.

3	A true classic!

3	I had one of these!

3	It was awesome, it went well with the zeppelin.

3	I can't remember if the box was one of those fold up the lid ones though.

3	Can't tell from the picture.

3	Anyone want to jog my memory, I always thought the sets with the flap lids were the best, I kept those!

3	Haha, I love seeing reviews where sigfigs and minifigures from the set present the set!

3	I'm looking foward your next reviews!

3	:D

2	The images are obsolete, please fix it.

3	Welcome to Cardinal Brick's Review of 7736 It's a small set but as I bought it the other day I felt that it probably did merit a short review.

3	The box is ofcourse far larger than necessary!

3	There's plenty of air inside.

3	The contence is one bag and the instruction booklet, you could proably build it inside the bag if the desire took you.

3	We have one new coastguard with the slightly stubly head found in the castle range and a trans-clear visor.

3	The build was challanging and arduious The final product is quite nice at one ?3.00 it's a good set only 50p more than an impulse set and with enough extra parts to justify the increase in the price.

3	A good set for a little gift or so on, the buggy moves well.

3	There's not that much to say really for I can't really think of additional models to build with the parts but then what do you expect for the price.

3	Edited by Cardinal Brick, 26 May 2008 - 06:47 PM.

3	Thank you very much for the review, Cardinal Brick!

3	That's indeed a very nice little set!

3	Klaus-Dieter

3	i recommend this lil set, it's a nice small set, and the vehicle does roll well.

3	I'm sure many young builders would love it

2	i might buy a second one of that set, and build it in the bag.

2	i just wanna prove that it is possible.

3	I bought 4 myself!

3	Its like having a little beach fleet!

2	So i just piced up a new digital camera and i thought what better way to try it than doing a review of my newest set.

2	The new 7738 Coast Guard Helicopter!

2	itsmy first review, so go easy on me!

2	lets start off with the small stuff.

2	First the mini figs.

2	You get 4 figs total.

2	Two helicopter pilots, a diver and a civilan to rescue.

2	The torso's are nothing new on the pilot and diver.

2	Same ones as in the last coast guard line.

2	But i like the colors alot better in this coast guard line than the previous generation.

2	The yellow and blue really work well together and the coloring on the badge looks great!

2	The civilian looks to be just a dock worker with an overall torso and a beenie.

2	The diver has nice vented helmet and a pair of flippers that suits his duty perfect!

2	Next we have an absolute work of lego art.

2	The rescue raft!

2	The orange flaps can be moved back for easy entry to the raft, as well as the white "support" beams with the caution tape.

2	I put support in perenthaces cause they really don't support anything.

2	Just there to fill in the gaps.

2	At the top of the raft is a red locator beacon, ccommunications antenna, and a cargo loop for lifting the raft.

2	lets move on to the interior of the raft.

2	Not much here.

2	But you can see the techinc beam that attaches to the top loop,and to the floor of the raft.

2	So far this has proven to be very sturdy and has supported the full weight of the raft quite well.

2	You can also see the white box that holds the equipment of the raft.

2	Here you can see the life saver tube.

2	Here's a shot with our dock worker peaking out the side.

2	The raft says max ocupants 4, but with the storage box, that might be a tight fit.

2	Now lets move on to the Helicopter!

2	in my opinion this is one of the best helicopters TLC has come out with to date.

2	I really felt they captured the look and proportions of a real Coast Guard helicopter.

2	it uses a lower hull and tail section of the new airliner, and cargo airplane.

2	It really seems to work well with this application.

2	The engines have good detail using new "cheese graders" as vents, as well as the new engine stacks that come in the new speed racer sets.

2	The rotors also appear to be new as well.

2	lets move on to the cockpit.

2	We have two seats for our pilots with a sticker sheet for intruments on a flat 4 wide plate.

2	There's also an antena being used as a flight stick.

2	Another shot with our pilots at the helm.

2	Now lets moveon to the high lihgt of this heavy lifting machine.

2	The med bay, and lifting winch.

2	http://www.brickshel...icopter_020.jpg here you can see the winch arm at rest, along with the medical strechter.

2	The bad part is that the med.

2	strechter doesn't include the ussually included fold away wheels.

2	here's a shot with the winch arm extened ready for rescue!

2	In the second shot you can see the drum that the wire coils up in.

2	It coils up via a recently new power functions "pull" back motor.

2	To operate, just pull out the winch cable, hook on your load, and presse this orange button on the side...

2	The bad part of the new power functions winch is that although its very smooth in its operation, its not very strong.

2	It will only lift the raft a couple inches before it runs out of torque.

2	It also has a tendency to want to pull the crane arm backin while its lifting.

2	It doesn't matter if its a light load, or heavy load.

2	The bay doors open on both sides for easy postioning of the figures and accses to the strechter.

2	Here we have our diver looking over his rescue-e. Nice and roomy if you don't mind a crane arm being in your way!!

2	At $39.99 and a peice count of 445, i felt this set was a great good considering what your getting.

2	The raft construction is very creative and is probbly the highlight of the set by itself.

2	The helicopter is probbly one of the best, if not the best helicopter TLC has ever came out with if you can get over its size.

2	in a scale of one to five.... Price- Peice count- Playability- Design- overall- .5 I would have given it a full 5 out of five, but since the winch can't pull the raft all the way, it didn't fell it right.

2	Even with this minor flaw, i still highly recomend this set!

3	Wow.

3	I was skeptical of this Coast Guard line.

3	Though getting to see some detailed pictures of this set I really want to get get it.

3	Alas, I have not the money to get it and it isn't available in my town.

3	Oh well.

3	Maybe I can catch it on a sale at some point.

3	Good review!

3	Great Reveiw this is DEFINATLY one of the CG sets im geting i cant wait to get my hands on this set!

3	Great review 5150 Lego!

3	The new camera was well worth it.

3	You´ve got everything well done.

3	I´m looking forward to your next review.

3	I love it its so accurate plus your review is great because it shows all the inner details

3	Nice review.

3	A must have for my city collection.

3	Great review!

3	This does look like an excellent set; great chopper!

2	Thank you very much for the nice review, 5150 Lego!

2	The helicopter is - apart from that it is very, very big and that it does not include any interior - a very nice set .

2	The most I like the life raft becuase it is simply .

2	Nevertheless I don't know if I buy it (probably not) - but it's very nice!

2	Two questions : -Where can you fasten the stretcher on to haul it up and down?

2	-Is the motor working with batteries?

2	Klaus-Dieter Edited by Klaus-Dieter, 28 May 2008 - 09:19 PM.

2	Great review, 5150.

2	Although, you might want to resize your pictures before posting them so they don't take forever to load.

2	Quote Wow.

2	I was skeptical of this Coast Guard line.

2	I was actually the complete opposite.

2	Ever since I saw the first pictures, I fell in love with the whole line.

2	The helicopter looks to be one of the two best in the line, right up with the 4WD and Jetski.

2	Great job TLC, and I do hope you have something equally as great planned for next year.

3	Very nice job on the review 5150!!

3	I definitly like this set much better now that I have seen good pics of it.

3	I am definitly picking this up as soon as I can.

3	Again, great review .

3	Model On!

3	!

3	Great review!

3	I will get this, but I will wait for a sale.

2	Klaus-Dieter There is no real way to lift up the stretcher.

2	Due to the crane arm being in the way there really isn't any room for any kind oflifting straps.

2	The set does include a 1x2 plate with a hinge for the diver to stand on so at least he can hold on to someone, the crane lifts them up and then he can put them in the strechter.

2	Thats my guess at least.

2	As far as the motor, i don't believe it uses bateries since you pull out the motor, and all the button does is recoil the winch line back in.

2	I have to say it does a very good job of that, and is very smooth.

2	(as long as you don't have anything to heavy) One detail i forgot to meation is the shark.

2	Its nothing new, just the basic shark lego has had around for nealy 2 decades, but it was a detail nothing less.

3	Nice review!

3	The helicopter reminds a Sikorsky chopper,isn't it?

1	I could tell from the pictures that a lot (maybe all) the designs on the raft were stickers.

1	In the whole set are there any printed parts besides the torsos or is it all stickers?

1	All stickers i'm afraid.

1	Though i'mnot a fan of stickers myself.

1	Some sets (like Ferrari for example) take longer to put on than building the actual set.

1	This one is not as sticker heavy as it seams though, and the ones that areon there really give the set that extra touch.

1	Printed would have been preffered of course, but in this case i didn't mind it.

2	Thank you very much for that information, 5150 Lego!

2	That's a very nice set.

2	I'm having my doubts about getting it though still.

2	The overall shape and size of the helicopter remind me of the real-life CH-53 military cargo helicopter.

2	A very nice review.

2	You've got the photography down very well I feel.

2	Perhaps a bit of nitpicking but at the end where you assign a rating, if you do a rating with faces (which is fine by me) you may want to seperate the faces by a line.

2	Otherwise it may become too crowded to the eye.

3	This is a very good review, thank you!

3	But I have some questions about the grey new parts in the life raft.

3	Are they 1x1 like their counterparts with the clips or 1x2?

3	And can they be held by a minifig by the handle?

3	If so, these could be very useful for brick-build weapons & tools!

3	Also, I'm looking forward to some orange ETA 2 Jedi Interceptor MOCs now!

3	Who wants to be the first to make one?

3	BTW, which Jedi has an orange ETA 2?

2	I think it´s Count Citrus....

1	I'm rather fond of helicopters and have built many different types.

1	This doesn't really remind me of any particular model, other than perhaps an EH.

1	101 Merlin and even that resemblance is very superficial.

1	Just for the record: this is a Sikorsky Sea King and this is a Sikorsky MH-53 (a derivation of the CH-53).

1	The only resemblance I see with the former is the colour scheme and with the latter the fact that it's got a fat rear-end, sponsons and six blades.

1	It doesn't matter though, because I really like it.

1	The colour scheme is great, the shape is nice, it's got quite a bit of detail and I just have to get my hands on the cockpit window and those new rotor blades.

1	When I first saw the large aircraft pieces a few years ago I figured they were very much single-use parts, but the tail end doesn't look too bad.

1	Pretty clever.

1	I like the raft too.

1	It really does look like the real deal.

1	That the helicopter can't lift it really isn't an issue, because in real life they wouldn't lift the raft either.

1	They'd use the rescue hoist to lift the occupants of the raft into the helicopter one by one (or perhaps in pairs).

1	Imagine a storm with a helicopter hovering over tall waves with a big fat raft strung from a cable underneath it.

1	The raft would catch a lot of wind and flop around quite a bit, causing it to loose all its occupants and also yanking the helicopter around, possibly causing the pilot to loose control and crash.

1	Bad idea!

1	Cheers, Ralph Edited by Ralph_S, 30 May 2008 - 11:09 PM.

1	I noticed that you said the torsos are the same as the last line; the last line had orange torsos, this one has yellow torsos.

1	-Chuck

3	Thanks for the review!

3	This set looks great and I really wish I had the money to buy the entire line.

3	But unfortunately, I don't.

3	I love the way TLC used the wing parts to the Jedi Interceptor for the life raft - very well thought of.

3	Anyhow, great review!

3	What an outstanding copter!

3	I love it.

3	The orange looks fantastic.

3	This is probably Lego's best copter to date.

3	Thanks for sharing the review.

3	I would definately recommend that you downsize your pictures a bit though.

3	I will certainly add this one to my collection, i already own every other rescue helicopter and i have a feeling this will be the best.

3	Just love how its completely enclosed, thanks for the review.

3	It was also in the movie; don't know why they didn't make it sooner.

3	Thanks for the nice review, ???theriddler???.

3	A neat and funny ice cream truck and a pretty detailed yet perhaps a little big tumbler.

3	An overall cool set for sure!

2	Thanks for the review Riddler.

2	Your pics are a bit blurry though, if you want them a bit better you should sit your camera on a hard surface so you don't wobble it as much I love the Tumbler, though it is quite massive, but either way I'll be glad to get it.

2	The figs in my opinion are really bad, Joker should atleast have a different suit.

2	Oh well, it's worth it for that awesome van, and instance where the stickers are totally worth it.

2	Thanks again!

1	Bring it on, oh mysterious puzzler.... Perhaps it could help a little if you would resize the pics for your next one, with all that automatic resizing going on it needs quite some time for the site to load.... in this context, to see two pics of your clock was perhaps a little odd too....

3	Great looking set, loved the review, pictures were good... sometimes blury but I think I will pick this up after I get the rest of the KOTCS sets.

3	Riddler a tip I learned in photoclass is to take a breath in and hold it while pushing the shutter so you don't accidentally move while breathing.

3	I thought it was silly, but it does work.

3	Again Great review!

2	Uncle Joker's cheap Technic Missile surprise Great Review, however, there isn't much appeal to the set after you see what the "surprise" is, though I can modify the truck to have an evil gas-ice cream making interior

3	I love batman

1	the stickers ruin the tumbler but the truck is very good if it was cheaper id get it

2	I am gonna have to pick this up, what a grand representation of the Tumbler and it would be my first Joker minifigure.

2	My Lego Bat-Life is looking up!

2	)TNR(

2	Looks like a nice set, thanks for the review!

2	I can't get over how enormous the Tumbler is, they should have made it smaller (the price too )I fthey did that and threw in a Dark Knight Joker and henchman I would totally buy it.

2	Enjoy your new set!

2	darthperson

3	I think this is a great set, great price and really detailed Tumbler, which looks exactly like the tumbler in the movie.

3	The only problem I have is the joker's hair piece.

3	Thanks for the review, ??theriddler??!

3	I am going to see if this set is at meijer, and I will buy it if it is.

3	And I am reviewing the Harley truck right now, and I will post a review later.

3	I have been thinking about buying this set just for the tumbler, And now I am sold one more set for the shelf.

3	Great review!

3	Nice review M8.

3	Shame that most of the pictures are blurry but nonetheless.

3	Just wanted to say that out of all my Lego sets, this one, 7888 is the best.

2	WhiteFang

3	Thank you for clearing that up I felt that it was OK to review an old topic, as stated, rather than just go ahead and start a new one.

3	A shame that this set, as all other Batman sets, have gone up so highly in value but still all things considering (general after market Lego price hikes) it is still a wonderfull set even with its market value today (that is if you can ignore the MRSP).

2	I too thought the Joker's van was the pleasant surprise of this set.

2	The Tumbler looks good yes, until you see it in person... it's grossly oversized.

2	They should have made it closer to a regular car size (like the movie), because this one is a monster.

3	I bought this off ebay, while not having been collecting space as a child, it was mainly Wild West and City...

3	I have decided, upon reading KDog's M:Tron Bar Brawl Mania strip in his Space Comic, to buy as many M:Tron sets and figures I could find.. except I got distracted and bought some different sets as well... To start off with, here's a picture of the box: Here's a general shot showing the entire set: A front view: The buggy: Another shot of the buggy without the minifig: The flyer: The flyer without the Minifig: M:Tron crate with some equipment and hoses, I don't know the use of the hoses though : The cockpit open: The cockpit closed with the crew: The Magnetic crane: Another shot of the Crane: Rear View with Hatch open: One of the side slots that can carry either the Buggy or the Flyer: Top view of this excellent Vehicle: Excellent for getting Spyrius or Blacktron out of your way : Final shot: Excellent set, one of the biggest space ground vehicles and one of the best sets made by LEGO.

3	Undoubtably better than it's newer counterpart the MT-101 Armored Drilling unit.... A great addition to any collection and has a lot of cool neat features that make it have a lot of playability.

3	Simply excellent!

3	Five out of Five!

2	Great find and thanks for the review.

2	Inertia, on May 28 2008, 11:08 PM, said: Undoubtably better than it's newer counterpart the MT-101 Armored Drilling unit.... Care to explain why?

2	Personally I think that aside from the colour scheme the new one is far better.

2	Why?

2	Suspension, more enclosed cockpits, bug-like appearence....

2	I suppose it's a matter of personal opinion though.

3	Great Review of a great set.

3	I always figured the hoses were welding torches (attached to jetpacks, yeah!)

3	as the whole thing had the vibe of a mobile repair center.

3	Much like many of my favorite sets, this one has a base of simple bricks and plates and then from that solid foundation the rest is built out to be decorative or have the action features.

3	This gives sets a very solid feel as demonstrated in this set, the first Snowspeeder, and Galaxy Explorer.

3	The MM Armored Drilling Unit has a more technic base giving it a less solid appearance and though I like the set, that jet that luanches from the back is horrible, partially because of the useless orange containment things.

3	The Mega Core has a nifty crane instead of a big useless jet.

3	-Tohst

3	Sinner, on May 28 2008, 02:35 PM, said: Care to explain why?

3	The MCM has a pure weight of parts that I find hard to quantify but love...

3	It is just so dense when you build it, full of nice surprises, no technique required, and a wonderful stearing mechanism that I rank as more important than the suspension of the mars version.

3	This thing was meant to crush anyway, who needs suspension?

3	I also like the way you never felt that the M-trons deserved a base after building this, it was that good...

3	The colour scheme was perfect...

3	It's space and I like it... enough said Great review BTW God Bless, Nathan Naturally you're entitled to your inferior opinion...

2	Norro standing up for a space set!

3	Thanks for those wonderful pictures and congrats!

3	I think buying this on eBay was a good decision!

3	I have no M:Tron sets at all, but I like the MCM very much.

3	It's just a wonderfully big set with many nice detials.

3	Lots of playing possibilities!

3	I wish I had it too.

2	Fun review, thanks!

2	Kinda sad to think that with TLC's recent ban on magnets in their products, we'll never see an M:Tron revival ...

2	I love the design of the front canopy of this set, but I always felt that they could have done more with the rest of the model.

2	This set is good candidate for customization though.

2	There is quite a bit on unused space inside, especially in the middle section.

2	I want to try putting a Technic-style engine into mine at some point, along with the necessary gearing.

2	I got my MCM brand new off ebay some years ago for a pretty good price, but the box was very worn out and the big trans-neon panel, which floats freely inside the box, was a bit damaged.

2	As for the hose/jetpack things, I always assumed that they were either welding torches or flamethrowers.

2	Take your pick.

2	Quote Kinda sad to think that with TLC's recent ban on magnets in their products First time I've heard of that.

3	The new train couplings have magnets, only with a special casing.

3	Anyways, M:tron is one of the greatest space factions, with mega core magnetiser as my favourite set of these guys (even though I do not own it ).

3	The only thing that bothers me is the lack of (reachable) controls for the minifigs to drive their vehicles (but iirc it is the same with a lot of other space-sets as well)

2	Fluyt, on May 28 2008, 01:56 PM, said: Since when is that?

2	The new train couplings have magnets, only with a special casing.

2	You're right, I should have clarified -- it's the old loose magnets that apparently are being discontinued, not all magnets altogether.

2	As you noted, the new train couplings still have magnets, but they appear to be permanently attached to a fairly large housing, which I guess will prevent kids from eating them.

2	But the old M:Tron round magnet pieces are presumably discontinued.

2	Also the MCM has a better design, in my view, as the wheels are closer together, making it look a lot more tankish than the MT-101.

2	Also space in the rear isn't wasted on having a shuttle.

2	CP5670, on May 29 2008, 02:52 AM, said: As for the hose/jetpack things, I always assumed that they were either welding torches or flamethrowers.

2	Take your pick.

2	Hmm.... Well they don't have much else to defend themselves with, and I think in the UK the MCM was marketed as a Mobile Recovery Center.

2	The only thing that bothers me is the lack of (reachable) controls for the minifigs to drive their vehicles (but iirc it is the same with a lot of other space-sets as well) yeah they could have used the normal levers instead of the pronged two piece things at the front of the cockpit.

2	But there is certainly a lot to mod.

2	Joebot, on May 29 2008, 04:25 AM, said: But the old M:Tron round magnet pieces are presumably discontinued.

2	Shoot... guess that BL and eBay are the only sources now...

2	Thanks for your input!

2	Thanks for the review, maybe I can pick one off eBay.

2	It looks like you're right about the old magnets.

2	I got a few off PAB two months ago but they no longer have them.

2	I guess I should grab some while they're still widely available on Bricklink, as they can be useful in a number of situations.

2	On a side note, one interesting thing about this set is that it seemingly had two US/Canada names, Mega Core Magnetizer and Multi Core Magnetizer.

2	Brickset, Lugnet and all the other sites I've seen call it Mega, but I have some North American catalogs from that time period that call it Multi and the box also says Multi on it.

2	I actually didn't know the Mega name at all until many years after the M:Tron line.

3	This does look alot better than the new MM drilling tank.

3	Great work!

2	I have about 10 old space sets coming in from ebay and gonna review them soon as well.

2	so that should be some good additions to the index when it goes up!

2	thanks!

3	I really enjoyed the nostalgia review of the M-Tron Mega Core Magnetizer.

3	This was the first wave of space lego i didnt get when i was a kid, though i remember looking at this set in the shops.

3	I stopped with blacktron1 and space police.

3	I look forward to more reviews once your ebay stuff arrives Cheers ISC

3	Thanks for that fine review of a really classic and impressive M:Tron set, Inertia!

3	Tohst, on May 28 2008, 04:55 PM, said: The MM Armored Drilling Unit has a more technic base giving it a less solid appearance (...) Yeah.... it´s pretty sad, some of these new sets just look very cool at the outside, but appear to be hollow and blank at the inside, especially with the annoying use of studless technic beams.

3	To MOD these sets often means to change the whole inner frame, leaving us with a bunch of IMHO not really very useful parts.

3	It´s not a very honorable marketing strategy to produce set designs that´re aimed to look impressive and cool on the box art, but´re pretty useless in their inner structures.

3	Of course I don´t want to offend some Technic lovers, and although I always was more the System kind of guy, why can´t they just use some technic beams with studs at least?

3	I grew up with 'just imagine', with pictures of alternative models on the box, and I don´t think it´s that easy, especially for younger kids, to MOD some of these terrific blown-up sets like it once was with sets like this one here.... Implosion off!

2	That's because of cost.

2	The older beams needed a four sided mold, and the newer ones need only a two.

2	LEGO do seem to be using both types more as of late though.

2	I've never heard an official word (...perhaps I should raise a topic...) but I think that they don't show them any more because it became a support nightmare.

2	What do I mean?

2	I bet TLG was tired of letters and calls saying "Timmy can't make this model shown on the box.

2	Can you send instructions and the extra parts..." I know that for some recent models they were designed but not published.

2	How do I know this?

2	The creator said so!

2	Sinner, on May 30 2008, 01:38 AM, said: That's because of cost.

2	(...) I've never heard an official word (...perhaps I should raise a topic...) but I think that they don't show them any more because it became a support nightmare.

2	What do I mean?

2	I bet TLG was tired of letters and calls saying "Timmy can't make this model shown on the box.

2	Can you send instructions and the extra parts..." Of course it´s a money issue.... my question was more rhetorical.

2	But I still don´t like how they sacrifice inherent set design on the altar of cost saving efforts.

2	To be even more correct, I don´t understand why they try to make extraordinary cool looking sets with a pretty weak 'inner life'.

2	Yeah, they want to sell sets with something that looks exciting on the box art, but.... LEGO was (and fortunately, is, with many recent sets too) always more than just an impressive spaceship or S.F.

2	tank vehicle.... it´s the sum of the set itself and its parts and what you can do with it that makes out the full fun of it.

2	The best thing you can do with a new set, beside some UCS sets perhaps, is to MOD the set according to your own likings.

2	This is where 'just imagine' begins, and how kids start to learn how to MOC, at least it was like that to me.... Individualizing official sets, and looking on some cool alternative models gave me my first ideas and helped my imagination and skills to grow, back in these days when I was a wee child.

2	Books, movies and t.v.

2	series as a source of inspiration just came a little later....

2	I can see many people complaining about how to make the alternative models, yes, but just stop using them on the box art´s a very poor solution and a dangerous one too, at least in long terms.

2	Of course I know that you know all these things too, Sinner.

2	I just think it´s a shame, and a risk too, because TLC´s perhaps sacrificing more than they might know by yet.... Building with bricks is the main attraction of LEGO, not just some cool crafts to play around with.... others can do this too and maybe better than TLC.

2	If the kids of today ever forget about the fascination of being imaginative, TLC´ll only lose in the end.

2	I've heard that the Alien Moon Stalker was called the Thunderfoot Launcher somewhere.

2	Ah, yes.

3	Here.

3	http://news.lugnet.c...n=51449&t=i&v=a Ah, that's interesting, I wonder why they do that?

3	This super set contains many of the city sets you can get for your mini city hospital.

3	The smallest set is the 7902 car with a doctor.

3	I thought it looked a bit too slow.

3	Here is a car you can build with the same bricks.

3	The instruction manual for the ambulance does contain a picture of an alternate model, but it is actually quite hard to build something significantly different.

3	This sets lacks some SNOT-bricks, so I had to be a little more creative and came up with this ambulance.

3	It is more a hearse than an ambulance.

3	The helicopter has a lot of slopes, so I built a speed boat for those special emergencies.

3	Unlike the first two sets, I used far from all the bricks in this.

3	This set does really have some great parts.

3	The brickshelf gallery with some more pictures.

3	Is anyone up to the challenge and build some alternate models of the last set in the super pack - The hospital?

3	A great and very creative work, I especially like the speed boat and the smaller car, just splendid!

2	Thank you very much Asuka, but I get the hint.

2	Last.

3	These are great!

3	I especially love the speed boat and your ambulance reminds me of Ecto -1!

3	(I would take you up on your challenge but I don't own the hospital.

3	It seemed overpriced to me...)

3	Brilliant, a huge amount of creativity there.

3	To do what you did with such limited piece counts is exceptional.

3	They're at least as good as most of the alternate models Lego show on sets.

3	Harley & Mistah J. I want to preface my review by admitting that I’m an unrepentant Harley Quinn fanboy.

3	I’ve been enamored with the character since she first appeared in Batman: The Animated Series back in the 90’s, and I’ve since followed her misadventures through her introduction into the regular Batman series during No Man’s Land, into her own series, and even on the short-lived and not-so-good Birds of Prey TV show.

3	So please excuse any pro-Harley bias.

3	So, down to business.

3	The 267 piece set retails for $30 US ($35 at Toys R Us) and builds up very fast and easy.

3	It consists of Batman’s Bat Cycle, Harley’s Hammer Truck, and brand new Batman and Harley Quinn Minifigs.

3	There is also no lack of weapons.

3	In addition to the usual bag of Bat-accessories and guns, the set also comes with a pair of gray revolvers.

3	Batman in this set has the new “armor” torso print and the hips are the same color as the legs, hinting that this is supposed to represent the movie style Batsuits more so then the traditional comic book “underwear over tights” look.

3	Harley Quinn is a very cool looking Minifig, and I haven’t grinned so much at a new Batman character figure since my first Batman Minifig a couple years ago.

3	The figure is very true to the character, and the torso has been accented with a few shape lines to try and distinguish her as a female despite the boxy body.

3	Harley’s jester cap is an interesting new piece.

3	It seems (to me at least) to be made of a slightly different grade of plastic then we’re used to.

3	It’s molded in red and painted with black and white, and it comes packed in its own separate little baggie.

3	I expect that this piece may have cost LEGO a little more then usual to produce.

3	Harley also has a buildable accessory, a giant mallet.

3	Sure, she can’t stand up all that well unless it’s held in specific ways, but it’s neat and most importantly, it’s funny.

3	It’s especially fun for smacking the everloving crap out of other Minifigs with.

3	The Bat Cycle is in bag number one and is a very fast build.

3	This isn’t some little Japanese sport bike like Nightwing’s cycle.

3	This monster is almost a car and seems to pack just the right amount of intimidation for the Caped Crusader to exploit.

3	Thanks to the thick tires (two in front, one in back) it stands up just fine on its own and rolls very well.

3	The huge exhaust pipes are a nice touch and give the thing a look of engine power.

3	The only real flaw is the inclusion of the flick-fire missiles mounted on the sides.

3	But, as with any LEGO model, they can be easily left out without hurting the look of the vehicle.

3	The hammer truck is the bulk of this set and a lot more fun then it looks.

3	Of the monster truck persuasion, the vehicle is designed and built with a surprising level of solidity.

3	The axle mounts are particularly impressive.

3	The big wheels and tires just beg you to drive this thing right over the Bat Cycle (or Batman).

3	The mega-mallet gimmick is also a surprise.

3	Not so much for its technical complexity, there isn’t any really, but for the fact that once you start turning the knob at the rear to swing the mallet back and forth, it’s really a lot of fun.

3	There are some low points to the truck design.

3	Again the flick-fire missiles are tacked on and there’s a cargo crate/bed set into the back for Harley’s loot of jewels.

3	The crate would have looked a lot better molded in black.

3	In brown it breaks up the look of the truck a little.

3	Speaking of which, the look of the truck is very pleasing.

3	The red and black Harley Quinn color scheme works really well on the vehicle.

3	There are a few stickers here, and unfortunately, the diamond patterned ones are applied over multiple bricks.

3	The rest, however, are great.

3	Not only does she have an “I Love Joker” bumper sticker, but she has a Joker playing card taped to her dash, I guess serving as a picture of her beloved Puddin’.

3	There is also a sticker for activation of the hammer, which boldly shouts HIT ME!

3	This is a fun set.

3	A neat new Batman vehicle and a big truck with lots of playability.

3	The Harley Minifig is a must-have for any Bat-Fan and, if you only get one of the Batman sets this year, I’d recommend this one.

3	The price versus piece-count on this set is a little bit of a deterrent though.

3	This might not be the best set for collectors on a budget or people looking for something completely new and innovative, but anyone buying this for a child can rest assured that the kid will get your money’s worth out of the set through its play value.

3	When added together and averaged out, the pros and cons of this set combine to give it a score of out of 5.

3	Even if Harley herself is a clean 6 out of 5

2	Darn you!

2	Making us wait like this.

1	Quote Looking forward to the review, this looks to be the best of the new Batsets.

1	*gasp* Are you kidding me?

1	Honestly, I hate this set.

1	The batbike looks far too blocky, and that Hammer Truck looks super shoddy and thrown together.

1	The only real reason I'd get it at all would be for the Harely Quinn figure - but I'd probably just get her separately on Bricklink.

1	Besides, the Tumbler and Robin's Jetski sets look far better to me.

1	They actually seem to have great vehicle designs.

1	No new villian figures, I know, but still some great old ones.

1	Er, wait a minute... oh yeah, hope your review gives the real scoop on this kit, Deino.

3	Add into the fact it has Harley, great wheels, a modable Batbike, awesome stickers and awesome pieces and I'd say this was a win.

3	The Penguin is a bit of a repeat and the Tumbler is too big for me.

3	Either way, it's a great set, Batman 08 wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be, which is great.

3	Batbrick Away!

2	Thanks all, i hope my HQ wil arive today, and Deinonychus i don't wanna do stupid to you but must i do also a review of the HQ set, i want to do that also a review of HQ without the blurry pics.

3	Nice truck!

3	Great review!

3	A very nice review, thanks Deinonychus.

3	That Batcycle looks pretty neat.... like a Hells Bats Angels version of that tumbler, a really nifty idea.

3	The truck looks simply sweet, a smooth design and, this time, TLC´s new habit of vehicle oversizing just works very fine.

3	A wonderful and very comical vehicle indeed!

3	And Harley.... oh my, this bill I´ll have to pay for myself.... Clonecommando007, on May 30 2008, 02:22 PM, said: Truck: Flick fire missiles!!?!??

3	Who Want's The Second Riddle?

2	The '08 Batman sets look like a step up from the somewhat lackluster '07 sets.

2	This looks like a very fun set with a whimsical sense of style very fitting with Harley Quinn's character.

2	The price isn't great, but I guess you gotta pay for that Batman logo.

2	On the downside ...

2	I am so over the good buy vehicle vs. bad guy vehicle concept.

2	I really wish TLC would get over this.

2	You see it throughout the product line -- Batman, Castle, Mission to Mars, etc.

2	Thanks for that great and creative review! )

2	Goiod day, gentlemen! )

3	Thanks for the review, great set, definitely the first of the Batman sets I'll be getting.

3	I love the truck and the Batbike isn't as bad as I thought it was, a win for me.

3	Batbrick Away!

3	This set looks really fun!

3	The figs are sweet, can't wait to see that Jester in the flesh.

3	Of course, the Jester I'm talking about is the castle one but that doesn't mean Harley isn't a sweet fig!

3	Thanks for that awesome review, Deinonychus!

3	~Peace

3	Thanks for the review Deinonychus!

3	This is an awesome set, It may just be my first Batman set

3	Hi all, so I was at "The Wal-Mart" yesterday and had the munchies and was looking for something to eat.

3	Somewhere along the line, I stopped caring about food and decided to browse the toy department to see what they had Lego-wise.

3	Usually, they have jack squat, but on this particular day they had a lot of new sets.

3	I impulsively picked this set up, along with Harley Quinn's Hammer Truck and the new little campsite from the Indy 4 line.

3	I must say, when I first saw images of this set I wasn't exactly thrilled or anything.

3	I mean, I didn't really see anything particularly special about it, but after purchasing it, I must admit that I would consider it a must buy for any Lego fan.

3	But enough babbling about myself.

3	Onward with the review (my first of an official set)!

3	In this picture, you can see everything you get with the set.

3	I thought the box-art was pretty nice looking.

3	The manual, on the other hand, took somewhat of a beating within the box, a common problem with most more recent sets.

3	I do have to say that I wish they would at least make some effort in fixing this.

3	They could just make a little thin cardboard "folder" to minimize bending and tears.

3	For Batman minifig collector's, the highlight of this set are the Robin and Penguin figs.

3	Previously, you could only get them in the pricey Bat-Cave set, but this set provides a much cheaper alternative.

3	One thing you will notice, however, is that Robin's hairpiece is a new mold, as it is actually a black version of Mutt's hair (from the Indy 4 line).

3	Personally, I think it actually looks better than the hairpiece used on the older version of Robin.

3	As the Batcave had before it, this set comes with some bricks to make two cute (but deadly) penguins.

3	They help add more charm to an already charming set.

3	When you're finished building, you'll end up with a nice little assortment of extra parts; 1 black "cheese slope," 3 1x1 tile (black, yellow and white), a revolver, a technic pin, and a 1x1 red round plate.

3	Here's Robin's Scuba Jet.

3	It's nice and sleek looking.

3	Notable parts of interest would probably be the green turbine engines.

3	My only complaint on this one would have to be the use of decals on the 2x2 round yellow tiles.

3	For that type of a part, printing seems as though it would have been the best way to go.

3	Now for, in my opinion, the best part of the set...the Penguin's sub.

3	This set has more decals than Robin's Scuba Jet, but they seem more necessary in this case.

3	I actually wanted to put the decal's on the sub, as I think the it looks great with them.

3	Obviously, it looks like a penguin, but wow, does it ever do it with style!

3	It has a lot of interactive features, the first of which I will mention, being the periscope which raises up and down.

3	And for the collectors of parts in new colors, it has a few parts in medium orange?, such as 2x2 tile.

3	Here's a shot of the bottom of the sub.

3	Another nifty little feature is how you can lift the top off and fit the penguin inside.

3	And there is enough room inside, so that you can firmly place top on again, and without interference to the movement of the periscope.

3	Another little feature is the rear spring-loaded missile.

3	You just tilt the small lever toward the front of the sub, and it fires.

3	And the last small feature are the flick-missiles on each side.

3	Overall, this is a great set with a lot to offer for a decent price.

3	A lot of fans might view the only drawback to it as being the use of decals, but if you plan on keeping the kit together they make it look really fantastic.

3	Buy it if you can.

3	Matt Edited by imperialshadows, 01 June 2008 - 11:42 AM.

3	Awesome!

3	I am totally getting this set.

3	Good review!

1	Great review!

1	Though you really seem to like this set, and it probably is a great one, I'm not a fan of the penguin sub, or at least I'm not from what I see.

3	Thanks a lot! )

3	I've already ordered it but now I'll be waiting for it even more! )

3	Thanks! )

3	Somewhere along the line, I stopped caring about food and decided to browse the toy department to see what they had Lego-wise.

3	Thank you very much for that neat review, Brickadier General .... I´m glad that you changed your mind, a review of a burger wouldn´t be half that interesting for sure.

3	It´s just a mediocre set to me, but of course it´s always cool to get important MFs in less pricy sets.

3	I like the Penguin´s sub from the Batcave more, just because they did a fine job on resembling a penguin without using a sticker.... Robins craft looks fairly nice, but the most useful parts of the whole set, for me personally, would be those indeed very neat green engines.

1	It's not for everybody.

1	Personally, I just bought the set for the figures, and I was originally just going to sort the parts and put them away in storage Asuka, on May 29 2008, 07:13 PM, said: Thank you very much for that neat review, Brickadier General ....

1	Yes, it probably would have been nicer if they would have at least done a brick built beak for the front of the sub.

1	Unfortunately, I never got my hands on the Batcave set, so I never was able to build the original sub.

3	Yay, another Technic shooter!!

3	Whew, I need a spare one in case the 14,348 other ones that I have all happen to break.

3	Seriously, do Lego set designers get some sort of bonus for incorporating catapults, Technic shooters, and / or flick-fire missiles???

3	Anyway, thanks for the review.

3	Looks like a cute set.

3	Thanks for the review!

3	I love this set, i didn't think it was much at first either, but i really love it.

3	Another cheaper Robin and Penguin is great, and those nifty mini penguins are awesome.

3	The spare pieces are even nice!

3	I love Robin's little scuba jet, those green engines are very nice and I love it compactness.

3	Penguin's sub is even better, at first I was annoyed at getting two subs but now I realise it means I can have a fleet of them I'll be sure to mod over those cannons though, but the details are very slick.

3	Thanks again.

3	Batbrick Away!

2	Thanks .

2	Why isn't this set on S@H?

2	Who Want's The Second Riddle?

3	Thanks for the great review, Brickadier General!

3	The sub looks very nice, and I like the idea of a raising periscope (did the Batcave sub have that feature?)

3	and the details on the sub look very nice.

3	The inclusion of The Penguin, Robin and two of those great brick-built penguins really confirms that I'll be getting this, considering that I didn't purchase the Batcave.

3	However, I am rather dissapointed that this set is so similar to the vehicles of Penguin and Robinin repectively in the Batcave set.

3	I feel that it only really caters to those who havn't bought the set, and I would've much appreciated different vehicles.

3	Overall, a very nice set, perhaps the best of the 2008 wave, despite it's lack of originality.

3	Thank you very much for the review BG

3	I was never considering getting this set as I don't really like Batman, but if I found this set and had some money with me, I would buy it!

3	Ii would use it for Indiana JOnes or something, and the revolevers and Top hats!

3	The only problem I see with the box-art is that the penguin is drowning!

1	Looks like a cool set, but the hairpiece for Robin is vary disapointing, I would be so glad is they used the regular hair you see all the time.

1	I hope lego will not make a habit of using that hairpiece on other figures.

2	Is not!

2	He just received underwater breathing super-powers and.... and.... Oh, well! )

2	Speaking seriously, great review, BTW! )

2	Thanks! )

2	One question: the teeth are printed on the sticker, aren't they? )

2	And are not on the box? )

2	Good day, gentlemen! )

3	Set: 8635 - Agents - Mobile Command Center Pieces: 1154 Price: $US89.99 Those dedicated Agents.

3	They've fought chainsaw-armed villains, battled radio-controlled cyborg crocs, chased pallets of badly-stored golden loot and wrestled killer sharks with vicious, toothy grins.

3	Finally they've caught the notorious Dr Inferno and imprisoned him in their cavernous Mobile Command Center.

3	But Dr Inferno won't go down without a fight!

3	Can the Agents stop the evil Dr 'Disco' Inferno fleeing?

3	Will Spy Clops laser gun burn through the door in time, or will Dr Inferno simply use the lovely Agent Trace's enormous ponytail as an escape ladder to freedom?

3	More importantly, will there be a riot in the streets of Lego City as AFOLs go apopletic at the thought of a 12 wide truck roaring through their ordered town layouts?

3	Stay tuned!

3	Part 1: The Box, Instructions, Parts As the largest of the Agents sets (so far), the box is easily the biggest.

3	Trainee agents, examine the following three pics and see if you notice anything odd.

3	Box front: Box back: Box middle: Spot it?

3	That's right.

3	The printed cardboard which has supposed to be the bottom half of the fold out middle section is on the back, slicing the ultra-large set image which would form the foldout in half .

3	The way the cardboard is printed as one piece before it's folded I think this would be very hard to do 'accidentally' so suspect a major stuff-up somewhere along the production line.

3	I bought this set off bricklink so would be very interested if anyone in the States who has seen these boxes actually on the shelves can tell me if this is common or rare.

3	Basically I want to know if I should be annoyed that the bricklink seller didn't list this in the set description, or are they all like this?

3	The instructions come in 4 booklets.

3	The parts list comes in at 5 pages, which is a lot even at half-size pages !

3	Large images of the parts inventory are in this folderwhen moderated for anyone interested.

3	Here's also some cute Agents-type artwork at the end of one of the books.

3	Instructions show piece call-outs and are divided into sections according to numbered bags.

3	As you'd expect for a set with 1100+ parts, this baby comes with a lot of bags.

3	It's a treasure trove of dark blue.

3	As well as the obvious large slopes and wall panels which make up the body and the roof, there is a wealth of smaller navy blue pieces as well - small 1x1 bricks, 2x2 bricks, 1x1 plates, 2x2 tiles, heaps of 2x plates, some slopes, 22x cheese pieces... basically anyone wanting a lot of dark blue should think about this set.

3	The roof panels alone, for example, could provide a dark blue sea for a modernised Pirate MOC.

3	2 DSSs (Dreaded Sticker Sheets).

3	Quelle surprise - stickers!

3	The grey parts of the stickers here are metallic silver ink, which is a nice touch.

3	Actually, as sticker sheets go, they're not too bad.

3	Fairly subtle for the most part and the navy blue actually matches the bricks themselves.

3	However, after looking at the sticker sheets I thought I was missing something.

3	What about the pieces used for the projection screens showing Dr Inferno and the sharks - why weren't they on the sticker sheets?

3	There must be another one!

3	Frantically I checked and rechecked the box and flipped through all the instruction manuals to find the elusive 3rd sheet.

3	Where was it?

3	Ten minutes later I noticed something which had honestly never occured to me - THERE WERE ACTUAL PRINTED PIECES IN THIS SET!

3	So obvious and yet so unthinkable.

3	It's horrifying how years and years of Exoforce and Speed Racer set releases can mentally condition people's thought processes.

3	Tut tut, Lego.

3	What have you reduced us to?

3	Here they are, folks - ACTUAL PRINTED PIECES.

3	(Yes, I do believe this news deserves the caps.)

3	I also noticed this nifty modification of the usual 2x3 cupboard - you can now fit drawers in it!

3	Very clever.

3	This may have been around in Belville sets for years for all I know, but it's new to me.

3	The drawers slide in and out very well and the top one sits on slight indentations in the middle of the cupboard.

3	Part 2: The figs!

3	Our trusty agents - Charge, Chase, Trace and Fuse.

3	(High powered agents don't have time for names of more than one syllable - that's why the bad guys always lose ).

3	Chase and Fuse have the Mutt hair in black and dark orange.

3	The lovely Agent Trace has an exquisite new hairpiece in dark brown, perfect for 'Rapunzel' themed MOCs.

3	As you can see, her ponytail is loooong.

3	Makes it hard to sit down, the poor girl.

3	I feel sorry for all these female figs with such intricate hairstyles that they can never relax in an ordinary Lego chair.

3	However, at least she has two breasts unlike the recent Harley Quinn fig.

3	Compensation indeed.

3	Seriously though, it's great that there's a separate torso print for the female character and this attention to detail is typical of the set as a whole.

3	Three of the agents have reversable heads - nice touch with the headsets and I like the ID cards on their pants.

3	Obviously the agents security system is based on some kind of crotch measuring device.

3	This would make sense considering the conspicuous bulges in the pants of Dr Inferno's men (see the other Agents set reviews.)

3	The villains - Spy Clops, Dr Inferno, Gold Tooth.

3	Dr Inferno's hair in all it's glory.

3	This is a great piece, although the orange colouring is a little rough on the front.

3	It's so 3D, it deserves a back and side view (and indeed EB thread) all of its own.

3	As mentioned elsewhere, this is different plastic to the normal minifig hair, but it doesn't quite feel as soft as the Exo-force hair.

3	It doesn't fall off as much, anyway.

3	The figs get 10/10 from me.

3	Awesome hairpieces in great colours for the Agents and a sleek navy blue/ neon green uniform.

3	The villains' faces are great and they are all very distinctive.

3	The attention to detail is outstanding and it's great to see a Lego in-house theme with characters as memorable and cool as figs from the licensed themes .

3	Part 3: The build The build is divided into three stages - the small vehicles, the front of the truck, and the massive command center section.

3	(a) Small vehicles First up, all the small vehicles.

3	We have a small flyer, 2 buggies, jet ski, and a speed boat - all in glorious navy blue with little bits of silver detailing.

3	Top view.

3	These vehicles are all simple, small and well-designed.

3	Probably the weakest is the flyer, only because the cockpit looks a little large.

3	In fact, the small flyer is probably the weakest element of 8365 overall, which tells you how good the set itself is!

3	In various threads here, this set has been heavily criticised for being way out of proportion.

3	There's a reason for that, as we shall come to.

3	However, the existence of these small sets should appease some people.

3	With the new coast guard sets, for example, all of these save the flyer wouldn't look out of place on a City beach with a little modding.

3	Here's an example - agents beach party!

3	(Spongebob couldn't help but crash.)

3	The villains only have one small vehicle, but they've been well-served in the smaller sets, and this one is a unique and clever design.

3	I love the triangular shape and the simple but clever technique of making the arch slopes meet up around the propellers.

3	It's sort of insectile in black and orange, and looks very different from the usual assortment of helicopters etc.

3	(b) Truck front This thing is a beast!

3	Seriously, look at it.

3	It's chunky and mean looking.

3	You don't want to mess with this baby.

3	The build is really nice.

3	Like a lot of Star Wars vehicles, it's all based on technic beams pinned together.

3	Unlike a lot of Mars Mission sets, underneath isn't ALL technic beams with some plates slapped on like a facade.

3	The majority is a lot of plates and bricks which all fit together solidly.

3	You can see from the detailing of 'cheese grater' slopes and silver pieces on the front how effort has been made to give this vehicle a distinct feel different to other Lego sets.

3	Sure, the silver slope mirrors might be a bit too much for some, but this baby is all about attitude.

3	You can imagine it roaring down the road en route to Dr Inferno's diabolical lair!

3	After all, these sets are 'Agents' sets - nobody said they were *secret* Agents (c ) Command center - whole assembly Here's a view of the whole thing assembled - inside and cool details to follow at the end.

3	It's kind of hard to show here as it is extreeeeemely long.

3	This is indeed a big set.

3	The build for the trailer part of the command center is fun and very satisfying.

3	Yes, there are large pieces but there is also a huge amount of detail.

3	It is also solid as a rock.

3	I remember being annoyed building the big Ferrari truck a few years ago - everytime you looked at it, an 8 x 16 plate fell off.

3	The Mobile Command Center is solid - even with the hinged roof and special features, it is not delicate at all.

3	Kudos to the designers, again as it is mainly a brick build rather than a technic one.

3	I also like how the command center part connects to the cabin - it's not a special piece at all, just a technic axle going through two circle plates, but it works and it's solid.

3	(Please note I've been selective about which stickers I've applied during the build.)

3	Top view: The rear: Here's an example of why I like the build: (a) the designers have enough sense to put a ladder so a minifig can climb up to the interior when the command center is open (b) notice that although the ladder clips at the top, there is an *extra* clip there in the middle purely to hold it in place so it doesn't flap around and holds firm.

3	I don't know if most designers would even think to put a ladder there let alone go the extra mile and put a mechanism to hold it in place.

3	Pure class.

3	Oh, and notice the greebly detail stuff to the right there too.

3	The other side.

3	This is probably the other weak part of the build - the bricky gaps at the top where the hinge to open the roof sits.

3	It's a little gappy but the set is so big you don't really notice.

3	(d) And now for the fun stuff - inside and neat details!

3	OK, so we've built the thing.

3	It's big.

3	It's blue.

3	The top of the trailer itself would make a good warehouse MOC for a harbour layout.

3	But what about inside?

3	Is it any good?

3	What about all those small vehicles from the start of the review?

3	Where do they go?

3	Well, I'm glad you asked.

3	Because the solution is superb.

3	The small flyer folds slightly and slides into place here: Lift off the roof and you're away!

3	The large buggy and the speedboat go under here: The jetski slides out of the rear here, attached to its own little platform: And the small buggy goes inside the main cabin.

3	There's even a crane so you can lift it down.

3	So now we know why this set is so large!

3	To fit everything in!

3	It's amazing that this functionality doesn't affect the aesthetics of the set as a whole.

3	But we still haven't finished on the details.

3	The front section has a very easy-to-swing-open roof section and missiles: There's also a command section underneath the bit where the flyer lifts out: And now for the interior.

3	I have to say I really like this space.

3	Not only is it packed with great stuff, there's also enough room for minifigs to move around.

3	I hate bases where the figs only have about 2 studs to actually stand and walk.

3	Aquabase Invasion is a nice set, for example, but the actual functional space inside the base is teensy.

3	Claustrophobia!

3	You know within a week they'd be fighting to toss each other out of the airlock.

3	No such problems for these suave Agents, who have plenty of legroom *and* the ability to launch missiles from their ceiling.

3	The whole of the interior: Zooming in: Moving from left to right.

3	First off, the medicine cabinet.

3	Looks like someone's been leaving secret mission dossiers lying around.

3	The projector area for mission briefings.

3	Dr Inferno recently changed his hair colour from purple to orange, it seems.

3	Why are all these minifigs so obsessed with their hair?

3	The projector folds down when the trailer is open.

3	Push the button and the light glows on.

3	Now Dr Inferno's hair is orange again!

3	This is one of my favourite parts of the set.

3	It works a charm.

3	The batteries for these lightbricks can also be replaced - instructions are in the manual.

3	Agent Charge considers shark-fin soup for dinner.

3	Did I mention these projection panels are printed?

3	The detail is very fine too.

3	The tool section.

3	Laptops sit in the middle compartment.

3	You get some flippers, yellow scuba tank and various implements.

3	I'm so impressed that the helmet is pearl silver with a different coloured visor too - there's so much variation in the parts in this set, you don't get the sense the designers are using the same thing over and over to save money.

3	It all feels luxe and top-of-the-line, just like the Command Center itself.

3	Two laptops - yay!

3	The aforementioned rooftop missiles: The Dr Inferno cage.

3	Nasty electric shocks!

3	Bzzt!

3	(You can see my reviewing skills are burning out now - sentences.... truncated...) Another example of detail - nowhere else in the set is a 1x1 transgreen tile used - they could have used a 1x1 trans green cheese wedge piece as there are others in the set, but they didn't.

3	How does Dr I get out?

3	Flick that lever on the right hand exterior and the door pops open.

3	Spy Clops the loyal minion awaits his master on the other side.

3	And there we have it.

3	Take a bow, guys!

3	There's a lot of spare parts.

3	A suspicious amount of dark blue small slopes but I checked the instructions and didn't see anything missing.

3	I have to say, I do like the new policy (since Speed Racer I think) of including these small slopes as extras.

3	Part 4: Overall Rating If you've made it this far, you've got more stamina than Dr Inferno's army of cyborg animals themselves!

3	As I said earlier, this set has drawn criticism for the size of the truck.

3	However, large vehicles do exist - I grew up in a wheat farming area and as a kid the size of the lorries that thundered past carrying grain was probably intimidating to me as this monstrous espionage machine is to the good citizens of Lego City!

3	On top of that, it *does* contain a plethora of 4-wide vehicles inside !

3	Criticism of this set on the basis of size to me also seems misguided as this is basically a playset - and it is a very good one to boot.

3	As you can probably tell, I love it to pieces and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone, whether for parts or for play value.

3	Check out the parts list in this folderwhen moderated and you can see just how many excellent pieces it contains.

3	A light-up brick, a flood of navy blue, metallic silver bricks - we're spoiled.

3	8635 is also an enjoyable build, with fantastic figs and top-of-the-line detailing.

3	In a year when I've found City a bit disappointing after the run of great sets in 2006-2007, the Agents line has been one of the surprise hits for me and I can't wait to see what the designers come up with next.

3	Looking forward to seeing your review!!

3	EDIT: Oh, I see!

3	I just arrived early.

3	A truely fantastic review, you make me not want to pass this set up, even though I can't possibly afford it without leaving my beloved Castle collecting.

3	It really looks like a fun set, so many neat vehicles, and two laptops, I can't wait to see what other sets we'll see them in.

3	Thanks again, great job!

2	I just didn't want my browser to crash and lose it all .

3	Yay!

3	I was waiting for this to be reviewed!

3	Can't wait to see how it is, I love the look of this set EDIT: Wow!

3	Fast going on the review there svelte-corps, I love the look of the instructions.

3	Batbrick Away!

3	Edited by Batbrick, 31 May 2008 - 06:10 AM.

3	Man I was hoping to be the first to review, ordered from TRU 2 days ago.

3	Oh well this set looks sweet, can't wait for your review.

3	Man, tohse mini vehicles and minifigs are sexy as all heck!

3	I love Dr.Inferno and the female pattern for Agent trace (is it just me or she almost "busting out"?

3	).

3	I love the Dr. Inferno hair, and the reappearance of Spy-Clops and Gold Tooth is simply gold (yes yes, pun intended!)

3	I have to say this is shaping up to be one of my favourite sets, well, ever!

3	Batbrick Away!

2	can't wait for the kick @$$ trailer review :D

3	Me want this set

3	You know I like many had doubt's about these sets when they were first mentioned, but I've decided I want the whole line now!

3	This set is the créme de la créme.

3	Just beautifully stunning!

3	That is a great review svelte_corps, you have gone into fantastic detail and description of all the elements.

3	Really it is this review that has persuaded me to buy this set.

3	I blame you!

3	The minifigs are great, the vehicles are better, and the truck and interior is awesome!

3	The few minor draw backs are far outweighed by the attention to detail and the many unique and cool elements used in this set.

3	And printed pieces!

3	That is even better!

3	Great job, you have obviously put a tremendous effort in making this review, and I for one definitely appreciate it!

3	I am looking forward to these sets being available in New Zealand!

3	MUST.

3	GET.

3	TWO Thanks so much, this review has truly shown this set as a brilliant one.

3	Even those who hate this theme must admit it is greatly designed.

3	I love the way the mini vehicles fit.

3	I love the light brick.

3	I love the truck front.

3	I love the trailer.

3	I love the missions bay.

3	I love holding cell.

3	I love everything!

3	EDIT: And I second dragonator's response when I say thankyou svelte-corps for this grand review, you have convinced me utterly to get this!

3	Batbrick Away!

3	Edited by Batbrick, 31 May 2008 - 10:49 AM.

3	Wow.

3	Like others have said i was unsure about these when i first heard about them but then looked at the first leaked pics and thought they actually look pretty neat.

3	now i have seen all the reviews i have to have all these sets.

3	at first i was thinking they would be great as parts packs but the more reviews i see the less i want to use them as part packs and just keep them as built (or buy 2 so i can do both !!)

3	Can't wait till they hit the shelves in the UK......

3	Thanks for the review

3	That's an AWESOME review.

3	And a great set, it seems.

3	With all of this year's Star Wars (I still haven't got Rogue Shadow) I can't afford Agents too, which is a shame looking at this.

3	Wow!

3	Great review of what seems to be a great set.

3	I love that ponytail.

3	This looks to be a must have set!

3	(It probably won't stay together for long though...) Thanks very much.

3	(I fixed the header for you; that's two you owe me.

3	The other is for making me think that this set was in Australia... )

3	svelte_corps, a fanastic review of this biggest Agents' set.

3	At first, I was not very keen to have this set.

3	However, after reading your review, you have make me swing up and down.

3	Its simply fabulous!

3	Thanks for your hard work.

3	I am sure it's not easy to do this review.

3	I love that female mini-fig.

3	She looks awfully sweet especially with her new hair.

3	Great job!

3	OMG!

3	Thank you, thank you, thank you!

3	You made my day!

3	So that means Dr. Inferno's hair isnt rubber!

3	But one question, is it like that weird funny soft plastic like the ants from Indy 4?

3	PLEASE ANSWER

3	Thanks for another wonderful review, svelte_corps A very fine set indeed, I absolutely love the way all of the vehicles fit into the command centre, very clever.

3	The projector is really cool, it looks very nice.

3	It's great to see these light and sound bricks in the Agents sets.

3	All of the little nooks and crannies in the centre are great too, I really love the amount of detail featured, mixed with all of the playability of this set.

3	The minifigs - as usual - are brilliant, the uniforms look fantastic.

3	Dr Inferno looks especially great, I love his white suit with hints of orange, and who can forget his hair?

3	I'm really tempted to buy this beast now, though I'm not sure my wallet will forgive me for it.

3	I suppose I'll have to cut back on Indy and Castle multiples for now...

3	Thanks for the truly great review, svelte_corps, nice work

3	Wow this set looks so amazing!

3	Amazing!

3	Genius!

3	Da'vinci art I say!

3	You've done an excellent job reviewing, and really, this is the review I've been waiting for.

3	So cool!

3	So classy!

3	I love the mission briefing feature.

3	To think that lego could go so high as to put something ingenious like that in there!

3	Too bad Lego figures don't have fingers to make shadow shows, eh?

3	Genius!

3	The Jet lauching feature is pretty slick, and they even put a control center in there too!

3	That's beast.

3	Loving that.

3	The bottom...I don't see how that big buggy can get out or in there, but, Awesome too!

3	The back of the truck could use more detailing I think, but the jail pop-open feature is pretty cool, as is the speed boat storage rack.

3	Cabin; it's great!

3	That roof opening feature is a great part of this set.

3	Also I think you can have multiple figures up there...maybe you can mod it to put a bed in there!

3	It certainly looks big enough!

3	Inferno plane, wow that think is smooth, baby!

3	I love how the wings contain rotors inside of them!!!

3	That's awesome detail right there.

3	That is a sweet ship thingy, so slick.

3	The rest of the command center is pretty awesome too; we get a 4x4 wheeler and a crane, and lots of room!

3	Wow!

3	Just wow!

3	Great review, great set!

3	You are well worthy of your custom title!

3	I'm gonna go buy this for only $90!!!!

3	WOOT!

3	Great Review, thanks!

3	That's one hell of a set.

3	I think LEGO has reached a certain kind of peak with the design, cleverness, and fun of this one.

3	I'm so relieved that Agents seems to be shaping up to be even better then I thought it was going to be...and I thought it was going to be cool to begin with.

3	Agent "Charge"?

3	Not only does he look like Dash Justice, but he has the name of one of Dash's Alpha Team squadmates?

3	I call shenanigans!

3	Woah, I got to have this set!

3	I shall buy it ASAP!

3	Thanks for the review!

3	Expertly done.

3	Splendid review!

3	I love everything on this set.

3	No question 'bout it.

3	Somehow I knew I should have saved up and buy that when come to TRU...but the sight of Turbocar Chase and Jetpack Pursuit was to tempting to pass up.

3	Wonderful review - one of the best I've ever seen on this site.

3	Man, we thought this might be the weakest set in the line, but it turns out it may be the strongest!

3	Everything about this set - from the color scheme to all the details to the minifigures to the piece selection - is just wonderful!

3	I think this set has finally confirmed it: Agents is everything Alpha Team wasn't, and is how they should have done a spy theme from the start.

3	Kudos to TLC for finally getting it right - and I sure hope there's a second year!

3	wow, excellent review, thanks.

3	That set sure looks fantastic.

3	It's incredible how much features they've managed to pack in while keeping it roomy.

3	I'm really impressed by the quality of the design.

3	TLC is sure getting back on track with great design.

3	ow... 2008 is going to be expensive...

3	Excellent review by an excellent reviewer on and excellent set.

3	This theme really does seem to be one of TLC's best.

3	Edited by Plural, 31 May 2008 - 03:24 PM.

3	Wow...I can't believe I thought this line was false...oh crap...SWEET!

3	I need to get this!

3	I first I thought the whole Agents line would not be very good.

3	But boy have I changed my mind!

3	This set looks amazing, as do all of the other sets in the line.

3	I really like how the small vehicles all fit into the truck.

3	I don't like it when sets come with smaller vehicles and don't have anywhere to store them, so they just float on the side.

3	That light projector is fantastic!

3	I can't believe they are actually printed!

3	This is definitly on my to-buy list!

3	Thanks for the amazing review!

3	7645 - MT-61 Crystal Reaper Piece count: 600 Price: $AUD79.95, 49.95 Euros (in most countries), 39.99 GBP, USD 49.99 It's happened in the wider world, and it had to happen to Lego - yes, the 80s are back.

3	Space invaders, holograms, compulsory seat-belt wearing legislation, and the return of classic Space.

3	Ok, we don't have a fully fledged classic space theme back yet, but if 7645 is the way of the future, I think Lego is ready to do it properly.

3	I wasn't a huge fan of last year's Mars Mission sets and only picked up a few on clearance, but this set is light years (excuse the pun) ahead of 2007's offerings.

3	This mining vehicle is solid, compact, and well-designed.

3	It looks impressive, and even better, it has fantastic Power Functions operability!

3	Behold 7645 - MT-61 Crystal Reaper!

3	(PS I wasn't joking about the holograms or seat belts.)

3	Part 1: Box, Instructions, DSSs (Dreaded Sticker Sheets), Parts Front of box: Back of box: 2 x instruction booklets: DSS numero uno - for the Reaper DSS number two - apologies for the blurry pic but I wanted to capture the sweet shimmy of the metallic holographic background on this sheet The way it catches the light really makes a difference to the small alien craft and makes it look much more interesting from the plain stickers of last year.

3	There's heaps of spare silvery stuff once the stickers are applied for those who use the leftover sticker material for customising.

3	Parts bags - 4 numbered with one extra with larger pieces Parts everywhere - woo!

3	I know the Lego instruction books scold me if I mix bags, but I'm a devil-may-care kind of guy.

3	In your face, TLC.

3	I love mixing all the parts together before I build, it reminds me of my youth when the days were long, anything was possible, and I didn't need strict instructions not to build on grass or poke my eye out with a technic shooter.

3	Interesting parts - these may or may not be new, my technic knowledge is not that detailed.

3	The little scoop parts are so cute and have a heap of potential uses.

3	I love 'em.

3	They're like Smurf hats at Miniland scale.

3	These technic wheel things in orange are also cute.

3	They kind of remind me of marigolds.

3	Giant Fabuland marigolds!

3	The track pieces - you get 70 of these - here's the section of track for one side - as you can see it's about 52 studs long.

3	These hold together better than the small ones on the Hailfire Droid/ Jungle Cutter.

3	Part 2: Minifigs, small mining transport, alien ship I have to confess - I forgot to take an individual snap of the astronauts .

3	It's the usual bunch though - Scaredy Face guy, Sunglasses in Space Man and a third one I can't remember.

3	You don't really care, though?

3	You're only interested in the alien commander and his matching arms/ legs combo deal.

3	As brickbitz noted in his review of the smaller set, the glowy eye is just a 1x1 cylinder.

3	The set also comes with 2 normal jellies - one pictured here for size.

3	You'll see what happened to the other one soon enough...

3	The alien craft is nothing exciting, apart from the gorgeous glinting stickers.

3	Here's the road safety angle.

3	The commander actually clips onto a 1x2 plate with handle so he can't fall out!

3	Then the lime tentacle thing descends on top of him to keep him firmly there, like a baby seat.

3	Not very brave for an alien commander, is he?

3	I mean, did Darth Vader ever use a seatbelt?

3	Tssk.

3	With cradle up: This part of the build also includes the small astronaut mining buggy - small and effective.

3	(Please note in this build I've applied stickers to everything bar cockpit pieces.)

3	This comes with radio and saw piece.

3	Part 3: The Reaper!

3	The first part of the build is the detachable shuttle.

3	I really like the retro aesthetic of this with the angled wings and the side hoverpod things.

3	It is much better than the comparable vehicle from 7699.

3	The new flickfire piece is a waste of space - it's fairly limp.

3	I prefer the simple flickfire technic pin to be honest.

3	There's also a very nice little side workshop as you can see.

3	I really like how the control unit is 'plugged' into the wall via 5 1x1 round plates (third pic, it's a bit dark).

3	Great detail.

3	[The technic pins on the back are there to connect the Power Functions battery box.

3	It's odd they're included at this stage of the instructions - maybe the intention was to release it originally with all the necessary motors etc but the price point was too high and they scaled it back] The base.

3	The shuttle sits on that bley technic axle in the middle when the Reaper is fully assembled.

3	The little vehicle scoots down the ramp at the rear, which folds up to hold it in place when the Reaper is in motion.

3	You can see there's a crystal container here as well - another nice small detail which I found the 2007 sets lacked.

3	There's also an alien here - thankfully not in those horrendous trans-orange tubes so prevalent last year.

3	The complete assembly.

3	Isn't it snug?

3	It's just the right size too - not massive but large enough to be a serious mining vehicle.

3	The ominous black treads contrast nicely with the white/ orange colour scheme of the vehicle itself.

3	The trans detailing - blue for weapons, neon green for energy - is carried nicely through the whole set.

3	The blades and the scoops whirl nicely as the machine trundles along.

3	Top down view: Tread detail: Whirling blades of death!

3	The buggy descends: Probably the most disturbing aspect of the whole set is this pic: The jelly has an orange pump plugged into its heart which is connected to an energy supply on the left hand side!

3	This vehicle runs on alien jelly juice!

3	Either that or it's milking the jelly in some equally disturbing fashion.

3	How amoral is that!

3	I know there's been debate about this - the jellys aren't innocent, they're evil energy crystal thieving maniacs etc - but I find it a bit odd that the humans respond by chaining the jelly up to the bowels of their mining vehcile and suck energy from its heart.

3	People debate about violence in Lego as represented by realistic minifig weapons, but I think the moral lesson here is even worse - it's OK to exploit foreign life forms for our own gain if they treat us badly first!

3	(Who-fans, I think the Ood should have a word with the jelly Commander ) That aside, this set is well-designed and fairly good value at $AUD79.95.

3	It's definitely a notch above last year's Mars Mission sets overall, with improved detailing and more useful functions.

3	The holo-stickers are fab and it's nice to have an alien commander, even if he is a bit bulky and his fingers are identical to his toes.

3	However, if all these reasons by themselves weren't reason to recomend this set, the following is.... Part 4: Power Functions The best part of this set - and the reason I bought it, really - is the integration of Power Functions.

3	Bizarrely this isn't mentioned at all on the box and I only found out about it from the instructions when they were posted on Eurobricks!

3	(Instructions for book 2 which has the Power function stuff available here.)

3	This is a great idea and hopefully we will see more new sets take this kind of approach (especially with the new Train sets).

3	Luckily I got Monster Dino 4958 on sale for half price earlier this year so already had most of the necessary motors etc - the only one needed was an extra small one.

3	What you need is listed in the instructions below with redirections to Shop @ Home to buy the motors.

3	Note there's actually a mistake on this page.

3	The 2 small motors you need are both 8883 not 8882 (which is the large XL motor).

3	Way to confuse the kids there, Lego!

3	Attaching them was a dream and only took a few minutes (In contrast to 4958 where it was almost impossible to remove motor elements without dismantling the model).

3	Basically the back platform and some plates and orange slopes come off, you attach the motors, and then the smaller plates go back on.

3	These parts are now left loose: Overall the look of the Reaper isn't badly effected as you're mainly viewing from the front anyway: Sadly I can't show you how it moves, you'll just have to trust me that it does !

3	The way it is steered is demonsrated in the instruction pages above.

3	Basically each motor is controlled by a corresponding switch on the remote.

3	Move them both forward to move forward, move one right to turn right, move both back to move back etc.

3	It zips along!

3	It's a speedy little thing!

3	Personally I wouldn't want to be in it's path as it comes roaring down the Martian canyon!

3	(My cat was scared as it was.)

3	It is oodles of fun and definitely worth trying if you have the motors or can get them cheaply, and adds a whole new dimension to the 'play' aspect of 'playset'.

3	It is also as I said very quick to switch between modded and non-modded Reaper in contrast to the more fiddly Dino creations.

3	The only problem I had is that if it moves too fast, the weight of the battery box at the back tends to pull the whole thing back and it rears up.

3	It does correct itself though.

3	I only trialled this on carpet last night so it may behave differently on other surfaces - I will need to experiment!

3	Part 5: Summation This is a great set made even better with the addition of Power Functions.

3	At $AUD79.95 it's well-priced.

3	Buy it!

3	Buy the motors as well (K-Mart still has stock of 4958 at $89, wait for a 15% off sale)!

3	You won't regret it.

3	Buy 2 and make competing battle machines!

3	The only thing is... just don't torture that poor jelly Edited by Sinner, 24 June 2008 - 03:25 AM.

3	Wonder full job, but now my wallet aches in misery.

3	Im not that into Mars Mission... but this set reminds me of the Jungle Cutter

3	Great review.

3	I just got 7644 MX-81 Hypersonic Operations Aircraft.

3	It's a great ship.

3	I started to review it, but then it started to rain (I was outside), so the review is coming tommorow.

3	Technicolor stickers!

3	Very pretty!

3	You really are an awesome set reviewer, svelte_corps!!

3	Thanks very much for this sweet review, so in-depth and detailed, that is one sweet vehicle!

3	It's got three of my favourite things, treads, orange, and big slicey blades!

3	Thanks again!

3	~Peace

3	Another great review.

3	I'm looking forward to getting this set sometime soon.

3	I wasn't aware of the power function aspect, similar I suppose to the old technic sets which had an additional instructions for those with the relevant motors.

3	I knew those dino's I got at clearance would come in useful.

3	Nice to see the recent "bulldozer" treads appearing in black.

3	Grey seemed a slightly unusual colour choice.

3	These new sets are just totally off-the-wall radical :D. It's the little details like the scoops on the blades and the alternate alien energy source (Lego didn't even have to include those, but they did!)

3	that show Lego are really getting back into their groove this year.

3	The ability to add power functions is just so cool as well, I'm going to pick-up the Creator Monster Dino set for the electronics when the sales hit as svelte has suggested.

3	A very entertaining review, just like the Agents mobile command center one :D

1	This set looks 10 times sweeter with the power functions, too bad I'll have to buy some extra.

2	nice review the power functions is a nice idea and i ownder if it will appear in any other new sets?

2	regarless if i get this (i decided to just to get what ever looks good in the shops from now on ) im defianltey picking up some of the white visors off bricklink

3	Wow, this thing is very cool.

3	Definately no lack of details, and is quite cheap for the bang of the set that you get.

3	For some reason I really love the bay in the back of the detachable ship.

3	Quite an improvement from last years line.

3	Thank you for the review.

3	I was going to buy this set anyway, but now I'm even more excited.

3	:D My favorite part of this set is the bay that holds the little cart vehicles.

3	Thank you for that fine review, svelte_corps.

3	That´s a pretty cool set, much more solid than the Armoured Drilling Unit, with a nice little transporter and some for sure pretty interesting additional power functions.

3	A very smart idea indeed!

3	Did I miss something or is there really only one (and probably improved) shooting device?

3	And there´re even some levers to control the vehicles.... wow.

3	A matured MarsMission on indeed!

3	Now let´s get rid of these poor utilized jellies and we´re right on the way....

3	Isn't it a lovely set?

3	I too have one.

3	(modded, of course )

2	Asuka, on Jun 4 2008, 09:26 AM, said: Did I miss something or is there really only one (and probably improved) shooting device?

2	No, you didn't miss anything.

2	There's only one, and it's the less obtrusive new piece The range is pretty poor, though .

2	So, is there some way to get all those motor bits at once, or do you have to buy them on their own?

2	I don't think I've ever seen them in a store here...

2	Iron Moose, on Jun 4 2008, 11:28 AM, said: So, is there some way to get all those motor bits at once, or do you have to buy them on their own?

2	I don't think I've ever seen them in a store here... Only from S@H so far, or if you buy sets which they come in.

2	All the ones you need (apart from one additional small motor) are available in the 4958 Monster Dino set (which I got half price).

2	I ordered the extra from S@H at the same time I bought the set - but only because I had already looked at the instructions and knew what I needed.

2	(If people have the Ferris Wheel set as well I think the small motor comes in that.)

2	This should be reported to the news .

3	Well I guess its nice that they're making the story background a little more clear.

3	With that jelly plugged into the power cable... Hmmh, both Jellies and crystals can be used as power sources, think theres a connection?

3	both of them are transparent and greenish... Maybe Jellies hatch from crystals like eggs?

3	or need them as food?

3	or something important like that?

3	Yay for evil humans.

3	Thanks for the great review Sveltecorps.

3	I bought some of the MM last year and ended up selling them off for SW.

3	This new set has got me interested in MM again, partly due to your cool review!

3	One question though, Did you get this set in Aust shops or S@H, just wondering if i should be looking for it yet?

3	EDIT: sorry just saw your other post saying it was ordered from S@H Cheers ISC Edited by I Scream Clone, 04 June 2008 - 08:08 AM.

3	Excellent review.

3	Loving.

3	This.

3	Set.

3	I mean, come on, it's a flipping tank!

3	Awesomeness is written all over this - from all those blades and scoops at the front to the mini rover.

3	And yes, you can even turn it into a motorized battle tank!

3	Reminds me of the old technic days when they advertised in the manuals how to hook up the kits with separately sold motors.

3	Another day, another review of an awesome set.

3	Yes, this is sure TLC's year!

3	svelte_corps, on Jun 3 2008, 12:09 PM, said: The only thing is... just don't torture that poor jelly I smell another "Dont hurt the dragons/jellies" or something group Nice Reveiw i dont realy like the MM sets [We WANT MORE STARJUSTICE/SPACE SKULLS!!!!!!]

3	But this one looks Ok i guess suprised they dont say that it has power functions on the box

3	Really Nice review!

3	I love those sweet looking power functions on it, if only the orange bits could be replaced, then you could have a futuristic and motorized Jungle Cutter Anyway, the alien bit was disturbing, but the overly-tall new commanders look very, very cool!

3	All in all, a great set, but I won't be able to buy it, because, in a few days, S@H will become 600$ richer and my wallet will writhe around in pain on the floor.

2	Algernon, on Jun 5 2008, 02:03 PM, said: Why is it that Agents and Star Wars get their own news articles but this fantastic set is totally ignored?

2	I think maybe there's a bit of Star Wars excitement on the front page which has probably got a few members frothing with excitement.

2	Not every review needs to be frontpaged anyway .

2	No, but this IS one of the most anticipated sets of 08...

2	Well, title says it.

2	The description, you'll understand later.

2	I ordered this off of S@H last tuesday, and oddly enough, it's listed on S@H as MX-81 Hypersonic Airplane...

2	I'd like to apologize for the random, horrible, faded pics.

2	I took the review outside, and the clouds kept shifting, changing the lighting, and then I had to go inside because it started raining.

2	It's been raining for a week.

2	It's raining now, as I type this.

2	So, I foolishly went outside to take pics.

2	The front of the box.

2	Not bad, as far as boxes go.

2	It features a lift-up tab... ...which shows the various functions.

2	Back of the box.

2	Still not much to say... Two manuals.

2	I think this is just right- Not too thick, but not too many manuals, either... Oddly enough, the box came with a little folded up piece of paper telling us not to mix the bags.

2	It comes sorted into 4 bags, by the way.

2	Minifigures The set features 3 normal MM figs, 1 normal jellie, and one of the new commanders.

2	I really like this guy.

2	He has a few issues, like his hands being stuck sideways, and still being hollow, but still a great improvement.

2	He'll make a lovely addition to any Halloween MOC.

2	Stickers The set comes with a fairly big DSS for the Spacecraft.

2	Pretty normal, but I do like the dragon sticker.

2	Then, suprises of suprises, a technicolor sticker sheet for the aliens!

2	How cool is this, huh?

2	The tops of the actual stickers are shiny, which is hard to see in the pic.

2	Even the bottom is shiny!

2	Who said stickers can't be cool?

2	The mining craft The little guy is pretty cute, and well built.

2	My only gripe is that there's nowhere to spin the drill!

2	It seems so lifeless without a feature...

2	The alien craft You'd think a Commander would be important enough to have a seatbelt, rather than be stabbed with a clip and stuck on the ship like those other grunt aliens...

2	I think this thing has some potential.

2	Shiny stickers, different body shape.

2	And when you look at those engines, this thing could be an alien Corvette!

2	But then you look at the back.

2	Pretty bare, no flares or anything.

2	It's a cool little craft, but it just...lacks.

2	The modules These things have some potential, as well.

2	With some modding, they could be pretty cool.

2	Unfortunetly, it's pretty boxy, there are no engines, and the wings are too small.

2	The top is pretty nice, though.

2	The greebles are all right.

2	The controls, as usual, are a sticker.

2	Pretty spacious, mind you.

2	The cockpit doesn't stay flush with the body, though.

2	The front plate underneath it can be easily replaced with a brick to fix that.

2	...I'm not gonna comment on this.

2	The main body Too bad.

2	The 'labratory' isn't much of a lab.

2	A trans-red panel and some tray thing are all that compose the 'lab'.

2	I was expecting more, but true to form, this Mars Mission set has no impressive interior to speak of.

2	There is a lot of space, though, so it shouldn't be hard to mod.

2	Phew!

2	The lab folds up like so.

2	Pretty simple, and would allow access to the lab, if there was one.

2	And then we have this thing.

2	What is it?

2	Defense laser?

2	Communications array?

2	Satellite T.V.?

2	The modules connect like so (sorry, out of place...): Too bad the pins stick out...

2	Various pics... As you can see, this thing has more of those bars than an AT&T commercial... (There, you understand the topic description now? )

2	The rear.

2	It uses a white City plane wing for the...wings.

2	When I first saw the prototype pics, I thought they slanted downwards... That would've been really cool.

2	Ah, now to the platform.

2	From the position of the drill, I think this could be a really cool turret location when I MOD it to more military space.

2	Back to the bars.

2	If we had space monkeys, they'd love this.

2	This set has more bars than a jungle gym.

2	( ) Here we see the button that drops the platform.

2	Pretty clever, and it's not in the way.

2	Best of all, it really works!

2	Really well, actually.

2	Good job, TLC.

2	2 more bars and a shooter mechanism.

2	Jeeze, this is really setting itself up for a joke.

2	A shooter mechanism walks into a bar... Never mind!

2	Here we have the handle that allows you to pick it up safely.

2	A good idea, but it's placed waaaay to far back, way off the center of balance.

2	You have to hold on to it pretty well to keep it angled up, though it does stop your hands from getting in the way of the platform.

2	Ah!

2	The platform in action.

2	This is really a neat little feature.

2	Not only can the ship land in a reduced footprint, but it also prevents the nice white paint job from getting red dust all over it...

2	It's centered pretty well, too, and you don't have to worry about knocking it over, just don't shove it back at all.

2	Here we have the latch.

2	When the button on top is pushed, this gets pulled inward...

2	...Which pulls out of this hole and allows it to swing neatly down.

2	Good luck, and happy mining!!

2	Again, sorry for the lack of in-progress review.

2	I would've liked to take pics of the mechanism and so on, but typical of the MM sets, you can't really take it apart.

2	Well, this is really a nice set, which can hopefully be upgraded with a better lab with little difficulty.

2	Some of my military mod plans include: -Strip the lab and install a command center -get rid of lots of bars.

2	The thing has more bars than Alcatraz.

2	-Install some turrets.

2	This is a big command ship, so why all the forward-facing weapons?

2	It'll need some AA defense... -mod the landing platform to be a troop dropper with installable AA turret.

2	-mod the cockpit pods to be more aerodymic.

2	So, that's all folks.

2	Shall I include one last "bar" joke?

3	I appreciate your review Mr. Mandalorian, but why the negativity?.

3	I'd try to find more positives about the set instead of kinda criticizing it after each picture.

3	I personally think it looks freakin' awesome!.

3	The size is very impresive and I nearly fell of my chair when I saw the first pics earlier this year.

3	It's quite unlike anything I've ever seen from Lego.

3	Edited by radiant7, 04 June 2008 - 08:27 AM.

2	Thanks for the review.

2	I really like all the Mars Mission sets this year.

2	The usage of the big wing is a bit annoying, but you can't blame LEGO for re-using the mold.

2	I've been considering doing the same with mine!

2	Mr. Mandalorian, on Jun 4 2008, 02:19 PM, said: So, that's all folks.

2	Shall I include one last "bar" joke?

2	I wouldn't have a bar of it...

3	Thanks for the review, Mr. Mandalorian!

3	This is an, er, interesting set.

3	Lots of frontal fire-power.

3	Very big too, and I like the idea of those two little craft that attach on the sides.

3	Sort of like little escape pod things.

3	Anywho, not one of the things on my to buy list, but I do like that radio-active sticker, that could come in use.

3	Looking forward to seeing your modifications, too!

3	~Peace

1	Thanks for the great and very detailed review.

1	I love the new holostickers!

1	I'm still not sold on this set though.

1	I'm not sure why...

1	I think it's the big wing piece and the too-technicy build (from looking at the instructions).

1	The platform seems kind of out of place.

1	And for the size of the set, the functionality doesn't seem as good as it could be.

1	It reminds me of 7699 Armored Drilling Unit - looks impressive but doesn't seem to do that much.

1	I do think Mars Mission has improved this year though.

1	Bar none, this is the weakest of the new MM sets I think.

2	Mr. Mandalorian, on Jun 4 2008, 01:19 AM, said: And then we have this thing.

2	What is it?

2	Defense laser?

2	Communications array?

2	Satellite T.V.?

2	That certainly feels like an homage to the Deep Freeze Defender... which itself feels like an homage to the Galaxy Commander.

2	Is there some way to centre one of the cockpit units without massive de- and re- construction?

3	Thanks for the review Mr. Mandalorian.

3	The Alien craft is a bit small in my opinion could have done with being just a little bit larger.

3	The main craft however despite its few minor flaws looks very good.

3	While space isn’t my normal theme I’m certainly being tempted this year.

3	Thats the observation I had when I saw the first pictures of this set online a few months ago.

3	I am a proud owner of the 6973 Deep Freeze Defender and 6980 Galaxy Commander, so I'm looking forward to see how the 7644 stacks up next to them.

3	There is a definite lineage here, and these sets clearly demonstrate the evolution of Lego set design over the years.

3	The MX-81 may not have the most playability out of all the new MM sets (although it has ALOT from what I can tell), but its hard to beat the look of a large sleek space cruiser sitting on your shelf or dresser, at least for myself.

3	Anyhow, this is my first post to the forum and hope my welcome won't wear out here anytime soon.

3	Having a name like that is a good start!

2	Thanks for the review.

2	I have to concede this does appear to be the weakest set of the summer MM lineup.

2	I've noticed a trend that the larger sets have plenty of parts potential but when assembled the model is not more than the sum of the parts... Eagle Base certainly didn't seem worth the asking price, at least this is one large model.

2	On a positive note the lame aero tubes, darts and martian carrier pods have disappeared.

2	Don't get me wrong, I love MM and most of the lineup is great, this one just seems to fall a little short of the BAR.

3	I don't understand why there's so much negativity... this is actually my favorite of the new MM sets.

3	The finished look is very sleek and not very gappy at all.

3	The deployable landing pad is great, and it'll make it easy to put on a shelf without taking too much room.

3	Lots of greebles... although I will concede that it's just begging to be modded.

3	Still, though, I'm definitely buying this one.

3	:) It has a really great look to it!

2	My screen name largely sums up my interest in Lego, but is not soley limited to Space.

2	Thanks for the warm welcome.

2	Two more questions: 1 - how stable is the entire craft when balanced on the platform?

2	Is there a chance that it will just collapse?

2	2 - what are the total wingspan, height and depth measurements of the model?

3	And, like you, I'm one who's definitely buying this set.

2	(I'm being curious, not confrontational. )

3	Great review, Mr. Boba Fett.

3	I really like this set a lot.

3	Some of the features may not be as good as I hoped they would, but overall this looks to be a really nice set.

3	I'm so happy that the giant spacecrafts are finally back.

3	Quote I've noticed a trend that the larger sets have plenty of parts potential but when assembled the model is not more than the sum of the parts... Eagle Base certainly didn't seem worth the asking price, at least this is one large model.

3	On a positive note the lame aero tubes, darts and martian carrier pods have disappeared.

3	Hm, actually, I don't see the comparison.

3	Eagle base looked terible to me right from the start, so it was no suprise when it ended up being the weakest kit in the first year.

3	This big ship, on the other hand, looked great as soon as I saw it, and still looks good.

2	Iron Moose, on Jun 4 2008, 02:15 PM, said: Do tell.

2	(I'm being curious, not confrontational. )

2	Well, first and foremost like many other people I'm no fan of those dreaded unprinted minifig torsos and stickers.

2	But also the cost to piece ratio of the set, it just seems too expensive for everything that you get, such as too many small parts and a lighter than usual piece count for the price.

2	Though if it had included printed minifigs and other elements, I maybe would of been able to swallow its 100 USD cost a little easier.

2	But Star Justice is still Lego SPACE in the most classic sense thats available today, and I will probably pony it up just because...

2	Anyway, I hope were not breaking Forum protocol by not discussing the 7644 review of the original poster or that particular set in general.

2	Wow!

2	i'll definately have to check this one out.

2	i always tried making a big mining deployment ship, but it always turned out crappy.

2	Edited by maiq the liar, 04 June 2008 - 10:52 PM.

3	Thanks for the review.

3	I actually quite like this.

3	I can't afford it, so I'm not getting too attached to it, but in its own way, it's great.

3	It's certainly reminiscent of Space sets of the past, as others have said, and the drop-down ramp section is just really cool.

3	As an idea, you understand.

3	Sure, the lab is a little crap, but at least the effort was made (sort of ).

3	The sheer fact that it's so big though, really makes me like this.

3	There's just something appealing about large spaceships.

3	Not capital ships, just big space ships.

3	With lots of guns!

3	Hey, it's no worse than Batbrick and I.

3	No, really, it isn't even in the same league!

3	Thank you for that nice review, Mr. Mandalorian.

3	Wow.

3	Somehow it´s almost like Classic Space´s back indeed.... It´s a great star ship.

3	It looks stream lined, original and impressive and even the huge plane wing part looks rather cool and smooth on it.

3	It´s equipped at least with some kind of engines on top of the wings and although they´re made with only two a little 'juniorized' parts it´s better than nothing.

3	There´s a lab or some sort of engine room with enough space inside to allow one or two MFs to play Scotty.... yeah!

3	The two cockpits´re nicely detailed with a cool use of these orange 1x1 round plates and to detach one or all two of them reminds a lot of the playability of the good old Space sets.

3	It seems even like it´s easy to attach them to some kind of Cloud City Twin-Pod Car thanks these hinged wings.

3	Looks like some solid fun to me.

3	Of course.... the cockpits aren´t airtight and even this reminds unfortunately of the post blue, grey and trans yellow era of CS.

3	Anyway, there´s no real fun without some MODing I guess.

3	Another great advantage of the set´s that it´s not overpacked with shooting things.

3	One technic shooter, cool in grey and only one trans orange prison pod too.

3	Well, I can surely live with that especially since it´s nicely asymmetrical.

3	The drill rover´s very charming, a little like a rebuilt Oldsmobile Convertibe stranded on Mars.

3	Sweet!

3	And that platform feature´s plain nifty and well done too, very playable and useable for a lot of things.

3	Hmm.... recently I complained a lot about the dense use of studless technic beams for the inner structure of vehicles like these ExoForce tanks par exemple which makes MODing (in an economical way) pretty frustrating.... but the beams here´re used in a very proper way.

3	It should be fairly easy to MOD, let´s say, the back of that lab section up to perhaps even the cockpits to create a larger airtight area that could be boarded from the platform.... just to fit this certain spacers need for, um, realism.... There´re many more nice details too like that 'satelite t.v.'

3	thingy and that cylinder with trans blue 2x2 dish for the knob or these cylinders with cones on that handle, and that Alien craft´s pretty nice and detailed as well.

3	Like I said before....

3	I really feel like Classic Space´s back.

2	Hey, thanks guys.

2	So you tolerated the bar jokes and faded lighting?

2	radiant7, on Jun 3 2008, 09:01 PM, said: I appreciate your review Mr. Mandalorian, but why the negativity?.

2	I'd try to find more positives about the set instead of kinda criticizing it after each picture.

2	I personally think it looks freakin' awesome!.

2	The size is very impresive and I nearly fell of my chair when I saw the first pics earlier this year.

2	It's quite unlike anything I've ever seen from Lego.

2	I'm sorry you guys thought I was being negative- I actually love the set.

2	It brings a real feel of Classic Space to MM (No, I'm NOT talking in the third person.

2	).

2	However, it does have its own small issues, which are nothing, really.

2	I said that there's not much of a lab- but that's the beauty of lego.

2	There's a lot of room in the ship, so it should be a piece of cake to mod to a bigger lab.

2	Too many bars?

2	I'll take them off.

2	I really like the set, I just want to change it to suit my tastes.

2	It looks beautiful- It will find a home among my other MM sets as a favorite.

2	Iron Moose: Good question.

2	It's about 17 inches wide, 11 inches tall (with ramp down), and 16 inches wide.

2	As for the platform, it's pretty stable.

2	It tilts back a small degree so it doesn't collapse when tapped on the nose, but I wouldn't leave it on the edge of a table while in that position.

3	I think this thing is compensating the poor lab with the bar army.

3	Nice review.

3	Just one little point.

3	Since there is no sound transmission through space, but there is an atmosphere on Mars through which this this thing supposedly flies, hypersonic airplane makes far more sense than hypersonic spacecraft ;)

3	Sorry Mr. Mandalorian, I guess I was just getting a bit defensive because when this set first appeared here, there were literally 2 pages of people just bagging out the new MM sets (but then the thread took a turn and people started to warm to them, much like the Agents).

3	I do agree that it definitely needs some MOCing, but with that work I think it has the potential to be a really amazing set in terms of what you could cram into it.

3	The lab is a little disappointing, I've always wanted an enclosed cabin space in a vehicle this size because then all the little space guys can have a true meeting place!

3	The drop-down landing ramp is my favourite part, it has lots of potential uses.

3	Maybe it's even possible to integrate pneumatics :D

2	Hello SheFOLS and AFOLS, as well as TFOLS, welcome to EB News Reviews, I am your host...For tonight anyway... Shadows will take over after this episode, if we make more... Today we are reviewing Mars Impulse sets 5616 and 5617.

2	Starting with 5617 Alien Jet, I must say it is a small and quick build, the jellie, is made of hard plastic, which surprised me, as I had expected Jellies to be a soft plastic.

2	The jet is mainly 2x4 plates, some swingy hinges, the "seatbelt" and a thing which I cannot seem to name My one gripe about it is that the Jelly cant see where he is flying, it looks better with a MF in it.

2	There was a red 1x1 as a spare part.

2	We move on to the 5616 Mini Robot, which is basically a "safe" brick, with binoculars, soem cheese slopes, little arms, and legs.

2	The best part i must say was the metal detector and "safe" brick, as these seem to be quite rare in sets (By my knowlage anyway).

2	The austronaut has a face, shown in Dr. Sinsters review.

2	The set also comes with a pick-axe and lime green gem.

2	Extra peices where a cheese slope, a green 1x1 and a white droid arm.

2	That concludes these mini-reviews.

2	I also will use this opportunity to show my photo setup.

2	Both sets are reccomended, if you either need a army, or are just trying to get a variaty of figs like myself.

2	Next wee-*Camera Fades* Edited by Sinner, 24 June 2008 - 04:17 AM.

1	I didn't see this one coming...

1	Probably because that huge white beard got in the way!

1	Was this "Shadows impersonates Aluvar" week or something?

1	Ok, this wasn't the worst thing I've ever seen.

1	We can try a real one in the future.

1	The not too near, but maybe not too far future.

1	I guess.

1	Where is that a map of, anyway?

2	Yes, The beard and hat are leftovers from what was meant to be a Athos Photoshoot, I was too lazy to remove them so...

2	They are - 2 Maps of Slovakia and One of Europe.

2	Stauder.

3	Nice and pretty funny....

3	I don´t like that little Alien thingy but the other set´s quite nice.

2	Hate to admit it but I enjoy Staudie's humour more than I enjoy shadow's Highlights include the inability to reach the cheese and the acious robot, thanks for the review!

2	Batbrick Away!

2	Ah ha ha!

2	A wonderful review, Stauder, very funny indeed!

2	The cheese bit made me laugh.

2	Stupid aliens.

2	Very good once again.

2	I hope to see more reviews in future!

2	Quick, go buy the other Impulse sets, I could do with another review of them... ~Peace

2	Hello all Eurobricks members, I will be presenting my first review on one of the Harry Potter's set.

2	Firstly, I must emphasize that I am not a very big Harry Potter fan or owned many Harry Potter sets.

2	For this review, I will be highlighting what is the beauty of this small little set, and the reasons to own multiple sets of it.

2	Comments and critics are strongly welcomed.

2	This set is featured in the Harry Potter movie, Prisoner of Azkaban.

2	This set is orignally released in 2004, align with the Harry Potter's movie.

2	This was actually one of the movie scene where Buckbeak the griffin is appeared in the movie.

2	The group of students are supposed to be having up close and personal with him.

2	However, Draco decided to disturb our lovely Buckbeak.

2	Enough of this movie synopsis, I am sure fans of Harry Potter will know this better.

2	Box art Featured mini-fig/creature Background scene The scene is a simple garden, which had a very good mixture of spare parts for your MOCs building.

2	On its own, there is nothing outstanding about this set, except for the griffin.

2	You can buy multiple sets for the griffin alone and for Draco mini-fig.

2	Well, you don't need lots of Draco.

2	But for Castle lovers, black cap are exceptionally useful, at least from my view.

2	Now, I will point out the following why this sets is so great for other reasons.

2	Hidden cover Note that, this is the only mechanism which you can find in this set.

2	It looks rather simple but quite useful.

2	There are some little things hide in it too.

2	Greens, Foilage and Brown parts Needless to say much, it offer 3 foilage, a green plant, 3 brown slopes, 2 ideal bricks and 1x1 brown brick for building a tree.

2	Great for jungle building, forest building and etc.

2	I am sure there are many builders will look out for these.

2	Interesting parts It comes with a wizard book, owl, 2 printed tiles with a spider and stone prints on it.

2	The far right, seriously I don't find any good use for it.

2	Can any EB members enlighten me on that gray thing on the right?

2	Grey parts It comes with a good 10 x 4 green plate.

2	Useful for adding as a platform.

2	Some more grey slopes for your MOCs.

2	There you have it, Draco encounter with Buckbeak comparing with Deep Forest Ambush As you may remembered recently, there was an impulse set competition.

2	One of my entries, which is under the History theme.

2	The Deep Forest Ambush was firstly inspired by this set, and made an improvement out of it.

2	Look at the improved tree compared with the orignal.

2	Summary review Playability: 4/10 (Not much to play with, except swooshing around the Griffin) Design: 5/10 (Too simple and its defintely not related with the movie scene) Parts: 10/10 (Great for parts, explained by the review.

2	A great deal of green and brown parts) Price: 9/10 (An inexpensive set based on the 2004 pricing) Overall: 7/10 (A must have for all Harry Potter fans and collectors whom needs a great use of green and brown parts) Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine.

2	More pictures can be found in My Brickshelf (When moderated) Let the Potter magic begans!

2	Edited by WhiteFang, 09 June 2008 - 02:45 PM.

2	A very nice little review of a pretty nice little set that I wish I'd bought between 1 and 10 of.

2	Just for the griffin.

2	Oh well.

2	Your review has shown me that it's useful for more than just that, so maybe I'll try to pick one up someday.

2	Can't have too many black capes, books, or printed things.

2	Speaking of which: WhiteFang, on Jun 9 2008, 09:41 AM, said: Interesting parts It comes with a wizard book, owl, 2 printed tiles with a spider and stone prints on it.

2	The far right, seriously I don't find any good use for it.

2	Can any EB members enlighten me on that gray thing on the right?

2	The gray thing is technically a plume, like any castle plume, except in this case it's a feather (presumably from the griffin), and made from the mold to the old Indian feathers in the Wild West sets.

2	It's a case of an old part coming back for a slightly new use, in a new colour.

2	Beyond that, the "stone print" tile is a bundle or rolled up blanket or package, depending on where it's used.

2	I don't think it's ever meant to be a stone.

2	It was used as a rolled up pack on the back of the Star Wars speederbikes, for example.

2	Nice pics, plenty of useful information.

2	I'd give this review an A+ Thanks for doing it!

3	I own about 6 copies of this set!

3	This is one of the few sets I've bought more than one (2!)

3	of.

3	It has a really good selection of pieces, and your review really does it justice, WhiteFang.

3	Multiple Hippogriff/Griffins On!

3	Edited by Shoc, 11 June 2008 - 05:58 PM.

2	Thanks for the review, you made me very jealous...

2	I want it also in multiple...

2	But I don't own any of it.

2	Oh, well for later then...

2	Thanks for that nice review of a really interesting and pretty cool set.

2	At least, a Griffin, I guess, is pretty close to an unicorn or a dragon, huh?

3	Thanks for the nice review - it was one of the first ones I got when emerging from my dark ages .

3	I bought two of these, just for Buckbeack - I thought he would make a good statue in a Persian temple type MOC.

3	I also liked the minifig head pumpkin and plant part in bright green - both new pieces to me at the time.

3	All in all, it was a good castle or forest building set with a nice selection of pieces for rocks, grass, plants and trees.

3	The dark bley plume piece also now appears in the 10185 Green Grocer set as detailing on the roof of the turret.

3	Guys, thanks for your kind comments!

3	I am glad that you have enjoyed this review.

3	For this set, I think I bought about 7 to 8 sets, all for the griffins.

3	It's used for my griffin riders in my Castle collection.

3	Now, the green and brown parts come in very handy for Castle MOCs too.

3	Thanks for enlighten me.

3	Now, I know where is the origin of that gray plume.

3	I wonder if I can use it to match with my castle knights as its plume.

3	In addition, I mistook the rolled up pack as the stone print tile.

3	Why didn't I think of it?

3	I must have overlook it, and used it as a stone tile instead.

3	Nevertheless, I am glad you have give me some good insights on the parts that I am not familar with.

3	great review.

3	nice set for plants, huh?

3	too bad i didnt get thus set... but luckily my neighbor did!

3	that griffin is nice for castle MOCs, and that orange head (pumpkin, i know) seems rare to me.

3	not much else to say...

3	Ohhh great idea to review the "old" Potter sets!

3	Especially the line from Prisoner of Azkaban...

3	I was in my Dark Ages then.

3	Luckily I was able to catch up on the missed figs with one internet order.

3	This Draco is the best TLC has made, if you ask me.

3	The new one (also doubling for Belloq and "guards" in the Indy line) doesn't look quite as hautain as this one.

3	Buckbeak looks cool.

3	Looks like his neck/head can be moved, right?

3	Rather similar to LEGO horses.

3	Well designed.

3	The orange brick doesn't have a pumpkin face on it, right?

3	Unlike the one from Philosopher's Stone in the set with the troll.

3	I'm looking forward to more reviews by you, sir WhiteFang!

3	Good work

2	Good work No printed face on the pumpkin since the event didn't happen on or near Halloween, unlike the whole troll situation I also agree that this Draco is the best one, the new one looks too much like a Draco from the oldr films, when he smirked a lot more, but, since very character got a redesign...They had to "tune him up" even if it meant changigng him for the worse

3	Guys, thanks for your comments!

3	Glad you find this review useful!

3	I have overlooked it earlier.

3	I strongly agreed with you, that this Draco is the best TLC made.

3	I pretty like the face compared to others.

3	Furthermore, I used my multiple Dracos, for my castle armor guards instead.

3	One could not have too many Dracos.

3	Buckbeak design is well made.

3	The head can be moved upwards and downwards.

3	The mechanism is similar to the horse design.

3	In addition, Buckbeak wings can be removed.

3	Similar to the typical green or black dragon wings that we used to see in the past.

3	Well, the main reason for me to buy this set was in fact Buckbeak.

3	You don't often find a griffin lying around except in Harry Potter sets.

3	Mr Spielbrick, on Jun 12 2008, 12:28 AM, said: The orange brick doesn't have a pumpkin face on it, right?

3	Unlike the one from Philosopher's Stone in the set with the troll.

3	Sorry to said, there is no print on that pumpkin face.

3	It's pure orange.

3	I bought about 5 or 6 of these sets when they were on sale in mid- 2006.

3	I still have a few of them laying around unopened.

3	I think I payed like under $5 for each and thats a great deal for all the variety of neat parts you get with this set.

2	nice review.

2	I like the treemaking pieces the most of this not very expensive set.

2	The Buckbeak fig is very nice and can bow his head like the horses.

2	I was annoyed to get another Draco without some other not made figs (Pansy Parkinson for example).

2	About the dark bley feathers; In the second version of Hogwarts there were several of these feathers put in little 1x1 cones like it was a feather to write with it.

2	I bought 2 sets of these and when they were for sale I just bought +/- 6 more of it.

2	Only annoying that I had then even a bigger army of Draco's.

2	I see a lot of good reviews on this site, but this one is superb!

2	Good job.

2	Tom

2	I'm looking forward to getting this set, as well.

2	The Hippogriff will become the valiant steed to my princess minifig for her comic adventures.

2	I'm really annoyed that the Harry Potter sets were released during my "dark age".

2	I so would've wanted all of them.

3	Yay!

3	The Monster Book of Monsters!

3	Now I want this!

3	I also love the Buckbeak figure!

3	It looks very realistic for a LEGO version of something, usually they are much worse (Look at the goblins, for example)

2	Very cool review !

3	Hello EB!

3	Yes, I'm cranking out the reviews!

3	The other day I picked up this gem for an okay sales price at Devonport, Tas, while searching for the new Batsets.

3	I informed iamded of this as he is a Spidey-suckup ( ) and he informed me this was the only set he didn't have of the Wave 2 of this theme.

3	So I ask you great EB members to please remind him of this when commenting!

3	Here we go with the review of Doctopus' lair: Anyway, unlike other reviews, this stars more people, the Batbrick-iamded-dragonator-Daisy review!

3	(Daisy is the mouse that came in the set) First up re the figs, and I must say they are great.

3	I love fleshies and these are excellent to expand my Batman world, plus having a Spiderman to beat up is good too Doctopus is great, though his tentacles are annoying to keep in order.

3	Peter Parker is a nice addition, I love that torso.

3	Eve though Harry Osborn was totally absent from this scene, I welcome him as he is a good fig also.

3	Best of all is Mary Jane, fleshie females are hard to come by and I love that hair, my very first one!

3	Oh, and even better is bley Daisy on the far right: Another fantastic thing is that by mixing MJ with Doctopus you get a far more deadly and real villain than anyone could've forseen - The Hippy!

3	Oh c'mon, tell me that ain't cool?

3	Anyhoo, here is a pic of Doctopus showing his might: Random fact: Did you know I influence both dragonator and iamded in their sigfigs?

3	dragonator adapts his from my IA series while iamded added Mutt hair when I had him like that in a pic I posted.

3	Now onto the box, sorry about the lighting.

3	The art is good and the cartoon spidey in the corner may have beenthe inspiration for a similar style in the new Batsets: Back of the box.

3	Again, sorry about the lighting and blur, it was gtting late and these were the last pics: Finally we get to the first part of the set: The catapult.

3	Is that movie accurate or what?

3	I love the part in SM2 when he uses his homemade genetic spider powered catapult to launch himself to the scene!

3	Oh well, it does comes with a cool spider web an trans blue spider, so it gets some points: And it is really fun!

3	I launched spidey several metres once, I don't think he ever recovered.

3	Infact, he almost certainly webbed himself Slightly cooler extras are these two.

3	This awesome little boat is great for city, as is the simple but nice bouy, Daisy approves: Naturally dragonator ruins everything when he found out the "dragon" that would be riding with him was our nickname for Daisy Now finally, the main attraction - Coctopus' Dock.

3	iamded and I threw dragonator in the water to see if he could swim.

3	He er, couldn't One Sweeney todd later, we continue!

3	The overall construction of the building is very good.

3	I know a lot of people hated stickers and i hated applying these, but they do look spectacular and perfect for any City setting, like a bank, a Gotham Bank As iamded has already noted below me the black lifesavers a very cool as are the web piece and log pieces: The inside contains the neutron copperplate triple bypass humdrum holy hum 5000, which does does, see movie.

3	Anyhoo, it is very cool, and includes a little control thingy on the yellow brick next to it.

3	Unfortunately, the inside is plain but for that: The other side has no wall too which is a bit of a letdown really, but atleast it allows Daisy easy access.

3	one gripe is those yellow 1x1 bricks, they serve no purpose and break up the colour scheme: Better shot of the thingy thing.

3	I quite like it, the use of technic parts actually works, and the whole set is worth it for those purple flames and dishes alone It closes up pretty well too, unable to hit the dish which is a nice feature: Me and iamded liked it so much we threw a revived dragonator into it.

3	Unfortunately it disagreed with him, but it was fun: Another shot of the dock.

3	I like how they have gaps in the jetty, I know the movie version was pretty wack, and although the set isn't very faithful to it (looks more like a seaside library to be frank) it still is very nice.

3	This is my first large blue baseplate too which is wonderful, though funny how the set only uses about half of it: The roof is a well designed and fun feature, it uses some technic connections to render it flexible of any degree, as you can see here by my opening of it: Better shot of the roof design, it can lie flat or at any angle.

3	I might use the design myself in the future: As much as I love the building this feature bugs me, for in order for it to work this wall has to stick out, which not only looks ugly but makes you be able to see through the corners.

3	Still, easily modded, and log pieces are fantastic for mocing.

3	It also means that there are 7 windows all up for a good, sizeable building: By pulling out the piece in the center the walls both collapss sideways outwards, which is actually pretty fun and works everytime: Overall view of the set including characters: Now for the story that makes no sense....at all: Spiderman is dead after falling down the wall mechanism (see above): Only Daisy can save the day!

3	For dragonator is being held by the evil Doctopus!

3	And iamded and dragonator are too busy not caring!

3	And Brainbox is too busy complaining that this goes against all Marvel continuity!

3	Unfortunately Daisy is on a lunchbreak so tough luck dragonator: And Daisy goes on a search for fortune and glory: Okay, this is what I think of the set: Build: 3/5 - Fun, but those stickers ruin the experience somewhat, and if you don't apply them the instructions are a bit hard to follow.

3	Playability: 4/5 - Great little gizmos and bits, not the kind that keep you going like with the 2007 Aquabase, but good fun still.

3	Design: 4/5 - Not very movie faithful no, but still a great little building and a smart design for certain aspects.

3	Minifigs: 5/5 - Great figs with all different faces and very useful bits.

3	Price: 2/5 Far, FAR overpriced even on sale sadly Total: 18/25 - A good set that could've been better with a few minor changes.

3	Nothing wrong with it, but it doesn't really cross the line to greatness.

3	That said, it has a lot going for it and definitely worth buying or atleast a look!

3	Thanks for reading Batbrick Away!

3	Edited by Batbrick, 13 June 2008 - 12:21 PM.

3	Lookin' good so far!

3	Though I must say it's Doc Ock, not Dok Ock...

3	The catapult is, well, ridiculous, but the boat is very spiffy, and the buoy is a nice addition!

3	I actually like the stickers on the window pieces, perfect for this building, and great for post-Apoc scenes.

3	Black life-saver rings are a nice addition too.Anyway, hurry up dragonator and Batbrick!

3	And Daisy!

3	I want to see the rest of the review!

3	~iamded away!

2	Great review as always, Batbrick! )

2	I always enjoy reading them because they really make my day! ))))

2	I hope that we shall see more and more.... Good day, gentlemen! )

2	I got this set in 2006 in a 'Byrnes World of Wonder' toy shop.

2	I dont remember how much, but it was a deal.

2	The box was all battered but it had everything.

2	Good review Batbrick.

3	Thanks for the review, even if it is a number of years late.

3	I picked this up whn it came out, and thought it was a rather cool set (besides the catapult).

3	Plenty of cool pieces, and the baseplate has found a use in the Batcave.

3	Although I think my dad managed to spill some beer on it at one point.

3	That was awful to clean off... Batbrick, on Jun 13 2008, 10:44 AM, said: And Brainbox is too busy complaining that this goes against all Marvel continuity!

3	I wasn't expecting that!

3	There I was, casually scrolling down, when I stumbled onto a picture of me.

1	WHERE IS MY SOAP????!!!!

1	Haha, anyway, nice review as always, Batbrick!

1	I too have the set and hate the wall jutting out, catapult, and missing wall.

1	But hey, review.

2	Great review Batbrick, I was curious as to what the interior of the building looked like, I still think that there should have been a few random chains or something lying around as they may add to the abandoned feeling that the ware house had.

2	Though I have to admit that I really like the roof dock and minifigs as some of them make good average civilians that are somewhat hard to come by in todays sets .

2	Great comic as well it seemed to add a lot to your review, hope you can review another Spider man set soon .

2	BTW as Adam mentioned I believe you owe me a bar of soap, for reading your review ... Edited by MacK, 14 June 2008 - 12:59 AM.

3	Great review.

3	The hippy and the "story" at the end were hilarious.

3	I think this was easily the best of the Spiderman 2 sets.

3	You're right though - it wasn't movie acurate, as the actual movie dock was far shabbier and more trashed than this.

3	Ah well, I guess TLC couldn't do everything.

2	Batbrick, on Jun 13 2008, 09:44 PM, said: For dragonator is being held by the evil Doctopus!

2	And iamded and dragonator are too busy not caring!

2	Wait... dragonator's not caring that he's being held by Doc Ock?

2	What are you doing?

2	A very nice finish to the interview, now I really want this set!

2	The story at the end was neat (except for Spidey dieing! )

2	but my favourite part was the exploding dragonator.

2	Nothing personal mate, it just looks cool when people are thrown into fusion reactors!

2	~Peace

3	Very good review!

3	i always wanted this set, shame I didn't get it.

2	Great review!

2	Oh well...

3	Hi Everyone, Please note that this review was done back in 2006, so do forgive me if you happened to notice any dated comments.

3	Product: 6205 V-wing Theme: Star Wars No of pieces: 118 Release Date: Feburary 2006 RRP: SGD29.90/USD9.90 Availability: Lego Shop@Home, Target, Toys 'R' Us (US & Europe), Bricksworld (SG).

3	Lego.com said: Rule the spaceways!

3	The sleek V-wing fighter can adapt to any situation!

3	Position the wings and flaps in attack mode to protect Palpatine's shuttle from enemies.

3	Or position the wings in flight mode to survey the area for intruders!

3	Either way, the V-wing is ready to strike for the Republic.

3	Includes Clone pilot and R4 droid.

3	Position wings in attack or flight mode!

3	Sorry to all for the delay, since this was supposed to be done 3 days ago.

3	Anyway, to get on with it... Quite a minimal amount of baggies for this set, as noticed.

3	And the best thing is... no sticker sheet.

3	Yippee!!

3	:bounce: The completed v-wing.

3	Though not really a complaint, it would be nice if the entire astromech body was provided instead of only the head dome.

3	:p Of course, then it wouldn't be movie-accurate, since the Q7 series astro-mech is integrated with the starfighter.

3	:lol: He's definitely well-painted for a simple mini-fig.

3	Since even the back is painted too.

3	I have to assumed this is the same mini-fig provided for 7259 ARC-170 Starfighter too, since I don't have that set.

3	Anyway, this mini-fig is much more accurate for this v-wing since his suit is rated against vacuum, while those in the arc-170 aren't .

3	:p One thing that's lacking is the instruments panel in the cockpit... it's totally non-existent here.

3	I wonder what went wrong during the design stage.

3	Personally... this is the second most anticipated set for 2006, the first being the tie interceptor, for me.

3	One thing is that there's no known release of the V-wing starfighter by hasbro, nor the other well-known brands.

3	The other thing is that being a star wars vehicle collector, I would really loved to see a replica toy of the V-wing.

3	And the V-wing by the Lego Group does not disappoint... it's nearly movie-accurate, except for the cockpit transparisteel cover which could used some paint like the x-wing's.

3	Also, there's a permanent landing gear that quite neat, since it allows you to land the craft on uniform surfaces.

3	The s-foils on the other hand can be quite a pain to pose into flight position.

3	Very difficult for the s-foils to remain symmetrical during play.

3	The "swoosh-able" or play factor of this product is quite good... just check out the pics for yourself... :D *Crackle* General Skywalker, we have incoming!

3	To conclude, the v-wing starfighter would make a much better companion to the Eta-2 Actis Interceptor (Jedi Starfighter), than the arc-170.

3	Coz the arc-170 seems more like a long-range bomber to me, than a snub-fighter.

3	:p And a final pic to show it at rest...

3	Comments (For 2008) Just an updated pic to show my latest display on the clone wars Hmm... off the record, I do understand that sometimes, reviews by most tend to a certain set of guidelines like naming the set, and showing the boxed, and out of boxed pics, and of course, the grading portion.

3	Regarding my review, I prefer not to grade any of the lego sets at all as far as possible, because to each, his/her own.

3	My reasons to put up a review is not to belittle the efforts of TLG in coming out with these products nor to help them market them, but to show my appreciation and enjoyment of these products.

3	I hope noone is offended by this, and would like to apologise for any misunderstanding that this may caused.

3	For those who do not understand the above paragraph, care not for it and Play On!

3	Like Me

3	Thanks for the detailed review valentin it had good picture quality and a nice little comic near the end.

3	Although this is a slightly older set it still was a good one, I remmeber that I bought two of them to build up a small airforce for the Republic, and if I see another one I may buy it for use in the Starwars Comic game.

3	Keep up the good work .

3	Thanks for another great review.

3	I remember getting a few V-Wings cheaper because the boxes had been crushed on their way to the store.

3	Not an "all-that" set, but still a fine parts pack with a decent design.

3	KimT

3	Nice review!

3	I would have snapped this up back in 2006 if i was not in my dark ages!

2	Great review!

2	And what are the stands that you used?

2	They look much better than the white bricks that I use.

3	Nice review!

3	Thanks valentin And a cool collection of prequel fighter you have there 'want'

3	Valentin, great review!

3	Nice to see you here in Eurobricks.

3	This fighter looks real neat.

3	By the way, Bricksworld pricetag is still visible in your box-art.

2	commanderbly42, on Jun 16 2008, 11:11 PM, said: Great review!

2	And what are the stands that you used?

2	They look much better than the white bricks that I use.

2	Oh, those stands were once CD-R spindles.

2	It's from the container that can hold 100 CD-Rs.

2	Hi WhiteFang, can't deny that they were once my fav.

2	hunts for lego, and yes, that price tag is a tad hard to remove.

2	Well, while am delighted at the V-wing, I still kinda wish it had come with a printed brick for its instruments panel.

3	Thanks for the review; I've always liked that one but haven't had a chance to get it.

3	Now I'm sold- or the set will be sold- to me !

3	Hmmm i must rebuild my SW Ships [A-wing,JSF & V-wing just to name afew] Nice review This is probable one of my favourite SW ships i cant belive i broke it for pieces [Just to make small crap mocs] Next time my friend comes over we will rebuild some of my SW ships [He always asks me if we can rebuild them so i finaly said yes ]

3	Anyway, nice review!

3	Love this set.

3	DSR

2	Oops.

2	Sorry, valentin!

3	IMO, this set is the best SW set of 2006.

3	Its cheap and sturdy for me its 9.8/10

3	yes I RECOMMEND this set it was my second star wars set ever and I MUST say it was a STUNNER for me CommanderFox

3	Here's the 3rd of the whole batch of complete reviews done back in 2006.

3	Hope you guys enjoy them so far.

3	Product: 6206 Tie Interceptor Theme: Star Wars No of pieces: 212 Release Date: February 2006 RRP: SGD39.90/USD19.90 Availability: Lego Shop@Home, Target, Toys 'R' Us (US & Europe), Bricksworld (SG).

3	Lego.com said: Challenge the Rebels!

3	Blasting out of Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi, the TIE Interceptor is the fastest fighter in the Imperial fleet!

3	Open the cockpit canopy and fold down the instrument panel to put the TIE pilot inside and recreate your favorite classic Star Wars battles!

3	Includes TIE fighter pilot!

3	Cockpit opens and instrument panel folds down!

3	It does seem to have more pieces than the average tie fighter, but this is actually cheaper than the 7263 TIE Fighter.

3	Of course, there's no light-up feature in this set.

3	:sweat: YesH!!

3	Finally... A...

3	Tie Interceptor!!

3	This is probably the most anticipated for all set for all lego tie collectors worldwide, since the fighter, bomber, advanced, and even the Expanded Universe droid fighter had been released by the Lego Group.

3	This set is near movie-accurate, since the bottom part of it ain't.

3	:p The cockpit and pylons uses the same design as that of the tie advanced piloted by Darth Vader.

3	Except for one minor change, that is the aft interior of the cockpit is strengthen this time.

3	And this is indeed good news, since the older models had a problem of hard hinge and loose brick connection.

3	There's no landing gear for this set, but it doesn't require it anyway.

3	This tie interceptor balances perfectly on its wings.

3	Standard instruments panel and, of course, standard imperial pilot.

3	The "swoosh-able" or play factor of this set is definitely very high... Just take a look.

3	:D *Camera view from own craft* *Camera view from Tie-Advanced* *Combat simulation of Endor's Battle from the archives* No bomber, since I started late in re-collecting.

3	:p To conclude, for a typical lego fan, this set is a 60/40, 60 due to it's good design, and for a typical star wars fan, this is a must-get.

3	The only flaw for this set is the same flaw for any lego set in SG, the price.

3	:doh: Comment(Current in 2008) Being a starwars fan... no... being a typical toy collector, space is definitely a premium... so much so that I turned to lego starwars to sate my appetite for more starwars products when I already have no more display space.

3	For the next few non-lego pictures, they are the crown of my starfighter collection in 1/18 scale.

3	So just view them for fun, eh?

3	And no, I haven't had the chance nor the time to do up a scene of my lego starfighters blowing up spectacularly since the pieces would be very hard to put back... Hmm... then again, isn't that what lego is about.

3	"doH".

2	why have you uploaded this twice??

2	?

3	Skipper 24, on Jun 15 2008, 08:02 PM, said: why have you uploaded this twice???

3	What do You mean, twice??

3	The Tie Interceptor is one of the best ties that have been made so far.

3	Though You're pushing it when doing a review that has already been done by a precious member of this site Fine review for a great set.

2	Thanks a lot.

2	Haven't gotten this set yet but now I might Edited by Vaders_son, 18 June 2008 - 12:45 PM.

1	I picked up this set mainly because of the many (5+spare) glow in the dark parts and the promise of 2 racers and one helicopter for the price of a little more than two racers (90kr.

1	vs.

1	2x40kr.)

1	The box The back of the box shows the two alternate models you can build if the polybags rip.

1	There are 3 cheese slopes and two 1x2 tiles that glow in the dark, where the tiles are exclusive for this set.

1	The total parts count is high at 142, but there are no really big pieces among them.

1	Inside the box you will find the building instructions, a sheet with some odd sticky labels (thrown away) and 3 polybags marked by the bag building difficulty.

1	The models The lime colored car doesn't bring out anything new.

1	We have seen racers built like that before, but it does contain some nice bricks for the collection.

1	The police cruiser surprises with an interesting design along the sides as seen here.

1	It is harder to build because of the greater level of details: The helicopter is without doubt the hardest vehicle to build in a bag.

1	I can't finish it because it's larger than the bag.

1	You can't put on the top blades nor the tail of the thing, so it beats the forklift from 7733 where the top bar is the new kind that doesn't completely fit.

1	There is also instructions for the alternate models, but it requires the bags to be opened...

1	The vehicles are pretty standard for the racers theme with the police car being the highlight of the set Conclusion I like the difficulty curve between bag 1 and 2, but the last bag should be labeled 1000000 instead of 3.

1	It requires some inhuman skills to build that helicopter in the bag... ?

1	Lime colored car: 3 - We have seen it before, but it has some nice pieces... and lime.

1	Police Cruiser: 9 - It has a massive diffusers, rare parts and a high level of details.

1	It is a shame LEGO relies so much on stickers.

1	Helicopter: 6 - if you see it as a set for one fourth of the price of the cars, it is quite amazing, but you can't bag build it and I would personally prefer some more detail instead of the big size.

1	Overall it is a nice little set, but the police car is the main attraction.

1	I wouldn't get the other vehicles if they were sold separately.

2	y'know you can open the bag

2	why didn't you open the bags????

2	?

2	it's called challenging one's self :-P plus you can resell it as MISB since it's still sealed in the polybags lol

2	there's something called opening the bag do you do this with everything lego set there's something called opening the bag do you do this with everything lego set

2	now now, don't judge people who do this.

2	there have been bigger sets that were done in the bag.

2	to each his own :)

2	Ahhh bag building... that takes me back.

2	I suspect that if I didn't do my bag building topic my EB life would have turned out very differently.

2	For the negative nancies, I suggest you try it.

2	I bought a set just so I could, and I found it fun.

2	(Not fun enough to do it again though!)

2	Thanks for the interesting review.

2	to each his own :) You make it sound like I did something deeply socially deviating... like being an adult playing with LEGO But back on topic.

2	Open the bags?

2	If they were meant to be opened, why did LEGO close them in the first place?

2	Bag building is not for everybody.

2	Some might become very frustrated with it and let their anger out on the set by lining it up on a mini golf course.

2	Nice review.

2	But I think bag building is a boring way to build.

2	I bought a Tiny Turbos set(A No-No for me) after I saw this "Bag Building."

2	It's actually pretty fun.

2	I built it faster than I would if I had opened the bags!

1	Seeming as there were no reviews of this set in the index I have uploaded mine from Jabbas Hutt .

1	Here is my review for LEGO set 10178 Motorized walking AT-AT Because I live in the UK I got this set with 6 free duracell batteries which was great!

1	(It's just twice as expensive as the US) Heres the basic set that is from the instructions.

1	This is the cockpit but please note after I took this photo I realised it was slightly built wrong.

1	Heres one of the feet in proportion to a minifig to give you a general size.

1	This is Luke Skywalker swinging on a wire trying to destroy the AT-AT I really wish LEGO didn't make so many Luke's because I want differnt minifigs.

1	It would also be nice for a thermal detonator piece.

1	Underneath the AT-AT you can see the shaft that moves the back legs, the motor and squeezed in on the righ t the massive battery box.

1	A load of cogs that move the legs.

1	These are the included figures Snowtrooper, General Maximilian Veers, AT-AT Driver/Pilot or whatever you want to call him and Luke all whithout there wepons.

1	please note Veers should have a dark stone snowtroooper torso with 4 red and blue badge things not 3.

1	These are the figures with weapons I gave them and the included ones Snowtrooper has new style blaster, Veers has Standard light grey pistol like the ones from the old adventure sets, AT-AT driver has old style blaster which I call heavy Blaster and Luke has SHINY HANDLE blue Light Sabre .

1	The Shiny blue light sabre was included with the set which is a bonus because i really dont like the grey ones.

1	http://www.brickshel...sc00521.jpg.jpg This is the switch which is attached to the battery box on either side of the AT-AT underneath the lift up side panels.

1	you push the forward to walk forward and backward to walk backwards simple eh .

1	A front veiw with the the panels open.

1	Here are the Drivers controls which are simply a cotrol panel and 2 exo-force robot hands which are joystick things seen in the film if you look closley.

1	The almost useless carry handle.

1	This is the weird back piece.

1	Looking down the AT-AT from the back where you can see the the battery box and switch.

1	Troops decending from ropes and cables and Vader leading the assult for this I hadnt got any more imp's so I used Clones Pilots.

1	(I now have a whole load more snowtroopers) Solo and Chewie sabotaging.

1	More troops to squash rebel scum huzahh!

1	A very bad picture of everyone packed up inside.

1	The size incomparison to its predecessor Overall I would give this set 9/10 because it should come with more snowtroopers or it could be and Endor version with loads of strormies and scout troopers.

1	Aswell as this you can really sit any one down because of the battery box but I stilll find space to put all the shown figures on this review in the interior as you can see on the above image the chains and ropes are hanging down a bit.

1	Tjis set is now limited to 5 per customer in the UK and now no longer comes with free batteries.

1	The walking on this is a bit wonky and dosen't really walk like they do in the film as it moves two legs at a time.

1	I am currently attaching a motor to the head to make it move independently.

1	Nice review, I have the original AT-AT and I like it a lot.

1	Considered buying this one but it being motorized made me not.

1	Also, I think a set this size could really come with some more snowies!

1	Benny

3	Great review Indexing it, as I write this.

3	How come You think the CTT is the AT-ATs predecessor?

3	Do you mean the motorized AT-AT or AT-AT's in general?

3	I think this is a great set and I am very fond of mine.

3	It's one of the few SW sets of mine that is on "parade" at all times.

3	Most are packed away in the attic.

2	I mean by the Clone Turbo Tank turned into the AT-AT I think in the films.

2	When they changed all there technology and vehicles when they became the Empire.

2	As far as I know the AT-AT was a invention by General Veers himself?

2	Benny

2	Nice job with this review Skipper

1	Nice review!

1	I echo the sentiment that more snowies would have been better.

1	Nice review !

1	The "Driver/Pilot whatever you call him" ( ) 's helmet looks kind of odd, and why does have a long red pole instead of a kick-butt lightsaber?

2	Vaders_son, on Jun 19 2008, 01:57 PM, said: As far as I know the AT-AT was a invention by General Veers himself?

2	Benny i doubt that.

2	the atat was used in the clone wars.

2	Well you never know, maby Veers was around then, just because it was used in the clone wars dosent mean that Veers didn't design it.

2	to Wookiepedia!

2	Vader had a red pole because I think it makes him look bigger and in the films I doubt it is but I think his saber might be bigger.

1	I never got the set.

1	It looked way to skinny.

1	I came close to buying it for the figs but then decided not to.

1	If you compared this one to the later one there is a big difference.

1	This one just didnt seem proporshined with the legs and its body.

3	thank you for the review, Skipper.

3	I never got this set because it was too expensive, and motorized.

3	It completley reminded me of the old robotic toys called Zoids, or maybe even Gundum.

3	At least the figs are great.

3	A chrome lightsabe hilt for luke, ecxellent.

3	and the pilot is cool too, and another snowie doesnt hurt.

3	and i didnt even know about the commander guy (whatever you call him), so people could have made a custom DS this whole time?!

3	thanks again!

3	This is one of those sets that you just have to have, I mean a motorised AT-AT is a dream set for original trilogy fans and has an awesome set of minifigures.

3	- u 2 kewl 2 do diz" Me:"Yes" Ph4tDuD3:"Kewl..do u have pix of the minifigs?"

3	Me:"Erhm..what minifigs?"

3	Ph4tDuD3:"The ph4t figs from the DS!

3	!1" Me:"This is the other Death Star" Ph4tDuD3:"OMFG there's more than 1" Me:"Yes" Ph4tDuD3:"keeeeewl.

3	must have!!"

3	Me:"Goodbye" [pushes the incinerator button] Ph4tDuD3:"wut?!

3	nooooooooooooooooooo..........." and on that note, let's start the reivew of the UCS DEATH STAR II.

3	Now this is an older set (2005) and I've only gotten around to buying it a short while ago.

3	It took me around 2 evenings to build it and I must say that I am fairly impressed by this set.

3	Time for a box pic: The Build: Since I started building this huge (small moon size) set at Morten's appartment, I wanted to keep as few polybags open at any given time as possible.

3	With this set it is actually possible to have a minimum of bricks scattered over a table or two while building.

3	Not sure why, but the division of bricks in the different polybags just work very well.

3	And that is great with a set this size - 3441 bricks.

3	The building of the set is divided into several "Build this times x".

3	For example the upper and lower part of the "unshielded" DS are completely alike.

3	This is difficult to see when looking at the model, but heaven when building it: And this is how they solved the problem of having the wings connected to the buttom of the Death Star - geniously done IMO: Note that in the first pic the "skeleton" is easily seen.

3	"The skeleton" holds the X to which both the upper and lower part is "clicked" on with technic pins.

3	Also there's a steering wheel (I'm sure there's a pirate name for that ) like the one in the bottom, in the top of the model to hold the upside "wings".

3	So after having build duplicate wings (upper and lower), the "belt" (all the way around the star) and the upper and lower part of the "unshielded" side, it was time to step back and watch the Death Star II in all it's glory: Such a great UCS set.

3	Now I did have a few "huh's" during the build: HUH!

3	#1 In the instruction the technic lesser-dragon-head should be dark grey, but I got it in light gray.

3	Go figure and thank you replacement parts.

3	I've experienced this before and apparently TLG uses different colours when "out-of-stock".

3	All one has to do is call them and ask for the right colour and it's on it's way Still a HUH!

3	experience.

3	HUH!

3	#2 Again it appears that TLG changed the design of the technic axleholed 1x2 bricks.

3	The bottom has changed and I got the set where it was mixed up between "old" and "new" version.

3	Not that annoying, but still got me perplexed as to: "Am I doing this right?"

3	Kinda stressing to consider taking most of the star apart to check the remaining 231 technic bricks 1x2 with axlehole.

3	Now for a verdict: : 1: looks great 2: even my "wife" likes it - female appeal 3: it's a great build 4: the polybags work for you 5: it's Star Wars 6: the design is awesome : 1: it wobbles if you touch it 2: very small parts come off, if you touch it 3: parts come off when you try to move it somewhere safe 4: zero swooshability So in short (yes even shorter]: The DSII is a well designed UCS set that has a great design.

3	Like most other UCS sets, it is not meant for play - hence don't play with it.

3	UCS verdict (the numbers) 5/10 (design++/instructions+-/bricks+-/sturdiness--/colourscheme+-) design: awesome look and great greeble set instructions: easy to follow steps with bricks mentioned hard to see wether it's black or dark grey bricks: loads of great bricks a zillion bricks of the same type sturdiness: DON'T TOUCH colouscheme: grey in grey with a little touch of black Need a missing instruction?

1	Thanks for the review KimT - it comes at a... confusing time You can take off the top disk and lift it like the Millennium Falcon from the top Now.

1	I actually don't like this set that much.

1	It takes about 5 hours and 15 minutes to build if you do it in one go, but the repeating sections makes this built the most tedious I have experienced.

1	It has way too many holes from which you can see the colorful skeleton and is overpriced compared to the older 10030 ISD.

1	I remember thinking it was too expensive when it was 50% off at S@H!

1	Even the Snowspeeder was "kewler" to less than half the price:

1	Hmmm, ive still got this set and i must say, i think you did a good job of reviewing it.

1	But...

1	Overall, i hate the set, probably the worst UCS set so far (apart from the naboo fighter but that hardly even counts as UCS) from my experience.

1	Unless you really really want it and have nothing better to spent your $$$ on, in that case go for it.

1	But in my case, it was a very repetitive build and final model was quite... well, bland, not must variety to it, if you know what i mean.for the price, i would really reccomend the UCS star destroyer, because thats a much better story..

1	Thanks for the review.

1	Eh, honestly, I though this was awful ever since I first saw the pictures.

1	To me, an incomplete grey ball doesn't really work as a special UCS kit, for the sole reason that it's BORING.

1	Extremely so.

1	Now, the new Death Star playset is a whole different story.

1	They should have done that in the first place.

1	Edited by Grevious, 24 June 2008 - 09:12 PM.

1	even though i never liked UCS, i absolutley hate this one.

1	Sure, its great on display, but the build looks extremley boring to me, just stacking plate after plate.

1	And as you said, its going to break a little if you touch it.

1	The only intersting part for me is the firing laser.

1	Although i do have to say the proce isnt too bad, i still wouldt buy it.

1	And no minifigs so thanks for the review, but ill pass on this one.

1	The new minifig scale DS looks awesome though, and this might have hyped some up who are buying the new DS,

3	Great review KimT .

3	I like this set (even if I don´t own it) because it looks simple fantastic to display.

3	I just have one question: The mini Executor can be moved around the Death Star II or its attached to that place?

3	Thanks for the review .

3	Good job KimT, it´s a really nice set.

3	It will be interesting to see the size of DS2 UCS compared with the new Death Star playset.

3	Keep up the great regulator job you are doing.

3	It's attached to the DS and cannot move as such.

3	Though there is 4 "spots" where it can be attached to the DS.

3	Reading your comments on this set, I can see why TLG has been forced to put it on sale on the US S@H. I don't agree that the ISD is better - IMHO they're exactly them same - big and grey This is a question of personal liking - which is the coolest DS or ISD.

3	Not comparative.

3	I'd still call this an ok UCS when looking at it individually, but there sure is a lot other UCS sets that would get a better score than 5/10.

3	!

3	Great concise review KimT, though its not for me, you held my interest all the way through!

3	Thanks ISC

1	I think it's a very weird and boring UCS set, but... What a lot of grey plates!

1	You could build something much better out of them, but it would be fairly flat.

1	It looks very fragile though , my UCS AT-ST is... Edited by Shoc, 25 June 2008 - 10:28 AM.

1	I also don't feel this is a very good set.

1	But is that old grey?

1	In which case it would be a nice part pack... Dr.

1	Brick

1	Thanks for the review KimT!

1	Honestly, like the others have said, I don't find any appeal in UCS sets, especially this one.

1	It's just a big, incomplete, grey ball.

1	The build was a bit boring and I suppose a big grey ball isn't all that interesting, but since the Death Star II in the movie is a big grey ball too, I don't see the problem.

1	I didn't think it was particularly fragile.

1	I don't care about minifigs or playability either.

1	A few plusses: in my opinion it looked pretty damn impressive sitting in my LEGO room and the construction is really clever.

1	All in all, I actually liked this one, but perhaps I have a different expectation of sets than most of you.

1	Sets are mainly parts packs and would you look at the quantity of grey plate in this thing!

1	(It's new grey BTW).

1	I paid half price for it at shop@home UK, which is still a _lot_ more than half price from the US, and I didn't regret it for a second.

1	Cheers, Ralph

3	Here are some advantages that makes ISD win for me: - A lot more fun to build with less repetitions - It is easier to build alternate models from it!

3	(How many alternate models of the DS2 have you seen?)

3	- The bricks are more varied.

3	- You get magnets!

3	- It is a larger set if you look at the size

1	Wow, what a letdown.

1	I recently picked up this set, and I looked up this review to see what I was getting into.

1	Not good news.

1	The silver lining is that it was a "Damaged box" deal at Brickworld, so it only cost me $100 (half off the already lowered price) so it was definatley worth it as a parts pack, if nothing else.

1	It's the last unopened/unbuilt "large" kit in my collection, so even if it is repetetive, I am going to build it anyway.

1	It is likely however that I may substitute pieces to do away with the colored interior.

1	I've already determined that after it sits on display for a while, I want to do a Zepplin as an alternate build.

1	Looking at the parts list it looks like its the perfect set for such an undertaking.

2	I'd love to get my hands on one of these, but you'd need about three jobs to justify the prices of this guy on eBay.

2	Fantastic review KimT!

3	KimT, on Jun 24 2008, 03:22 PM, said: 4: zero swooshability I think its very swooshable, assuming you swoosh it at the same speed it moves in the movie.

3	:D While I would never do something like this, I bet if you packed this sucker with a bunch of M80 firecrackers it would make for a fantastic end to a stop motion movie.

3	With it being as delicate as you say it is I bet you wouldn't destroy any parts.

3	Edited by gotoAndLego, 03 April 2010 - 02:57 PM.

3	Dang!

3	So much negativity on a such spectacular set!

3	This baby provides an amazing backdrop to any Lego inspired Star Wars diorama.

3	And lets face it Lego tends to be a rectangular brick and somehow we now have a sphere!!!

3	Guys... its a UCS.

3	It accurately depicts the on screen icon and put plain and simple is a wonderful sculptural piece of work in its own right.

3	I agree with KimT in that the removal of the laser and Super Star Destroyer gives it more authenticity but to call it a gray golf ball or ignore its inherent accuracy is simply to miss the point.

3	It proved to be the best build to share with someone, be it family or friend due, to its repeated sections and impressive finish.

3	Its a clever build and to criticize it for lack of playability or (I suspect for many) its absence of minifigs is just absurd and possibly why Lego has not released a proper UCS in nearly two years.

3	I reckon many out there would love a UCS Tyderium, Imperial Walker or Slave 1 with a spectacular piece count be it minifig scale or just darn impressive in its own right.

3	Sadly for those who love these sculptural masterpieces we're stuck with simple toys with 'play features' and cute minifigs.

3	Clever in their own right but lacking the clout and purity of the old UCS line.

3	Let's hope some diversity of product is just around the corner else 10179 was the last of the truly brave financial gambles of the Star Wars line....

2	I decided to re-read this review because I just got this set today.

2	I dont really have a concern over the design or repeating build process because owning this set was never an option for me as I collect UCS sets...

2	But I am surprised to see an almost total lack of positive posts.

2	I really hope that I enjoy this build.

2	Hi, you may find this thread interesting, I really enjoyed Bricklinking it

1	I bricklinked it too back in the day.

1	It was an interesting build - just thought building the "unfinished" hemisphere was kind of tedious.

3	I've just ordered the bits for this from bricklink (I'm awaiting the final order now) so I'm interested in these comments.

3	I can see that, since I'll be building it with the kids, I'll have to plan in plenty of breaks and do lots of parallel building to keep us all from getting bored!

3	7656 General Greivous's Starfighter Release: 2007 Number of Pieces: 232 Minifigs: 1 Brickset Welcome!

3	This is my first review, so contstructive critisism is very much appreciated!

3	On to the review: First, we start out with the box: The box art is the same as always since 2006. nothing special.

3	Then we start the build.

3	The build is fairly easy, and will take the seasoned builder about 15-20 min to complete.

3	Here is the finished model: and bird's eye view: As you can see, this ship is very sleek.

3	The fins or "wings" each have an outer slope and an inner one, with the guns in between.

3	There are also cones on the front of the fins, which give the ship an even more sleek look.

3	In the middle of the wings there is the main body, with a big slope and stripes decorating it.

3	This set has a very good playability factor, as I'm about to show you now.

3	The guns on the ship are pretty cool looking to begin with; a bley slope attaching a lightsaber hilt and a trans-neon green stud to the fin on each side.

3	But theres more than what meets the eye: Yes, the guns flip up!

3	...and they can flip all the way back to hide them, for whatever case they need hiding.

3	Lets have a look at the back, there is a tail fin used as landing gear and some lightspeed boosters: But wait...

3	The tail fin can flip up for flight thanks to a hinge attached to the back of the cockpit.

3	Heres another playability factor: The cockpit can slide open very smoothly and easily.

3	Heres how this is possible: A clever system under the hood allows the cockpit to open.

3	See those two bley pieces on the black ones?

3	Those bley ones attach to the tan plates under the hood, and the hood and windsheild attach to the black peices.

3	The black and bley pieces work together as a sliding system, so the cockpit opens.

3	Viola!

3	And then the cockpit snaps in place thanks to the red hook and clip.

3	Its a very accurate system, and works very well.

3	You'll want to open and close it over and over again!

3	Now, finnaly to the fig: The General himself.

3	A very impressive fig, with a new head and torso mold.

3	In this set, (which is one of only two with Greivous in it) he comes with 2 green and two blue lightsabers, all with bley hilts ( ).

3	I was hoping for chrome hilts, but its a minor fault.

3	Grievous also comes with a new mold pistol blaster (not pictured).

3	Heres the General in the cockpit (sadly a weak cockpit, no details): He just half lays down on a small slope.

3	In this set, he doesnt come with a cape beacuse with it on, the cockpit doesnt close.

3	Thats about it, heres the...

3	FINAL VERDICT: Build: 7/10 Fairly easy but fun.

3	A little bit weak.

3	Playability: 8/10 Many playability factors, but some are boring or pointless.

3	Swooshability: 8/10 very fun to fly around, sometimes pieces break off.

3	Minifigs: 10/10 one amazing fig with 4 lightsabers and a new blaster.

3	what more could you ask for?

3	Design: 9/10 very sleek, but hardly any real texture.

3	i like it, but others might want greebling.

3	Price: 10/10 Overall Score: 9/10 A very cool ship with a very cool minifig and accessories.

3	One of the best SW sets I have ever seen for its small price I highly recommend it to any kind of SW, LEGO, or SW LEGO fan.

3	Hope you enjoyed my review, please leave feedback!

2	EDIT: as soon as I post the images came thats weird.

2	Nice review, is there more it says i'll be back?

2	Good first Review!

2	Edited by Skipper 24, 26 June 2008 - 09:11 PM.

2	sorry about that Skipper, i added the topic after the first pic was uploaded just to make sure the pics would be in the post.

2	You probably posted while i was editing it.

2	And i had to go to visit my grandparents, im at their house right now.

2	sorry if you got freaked out!

2	Very nice review Jim!

2	I haven't bought this set yet, but am planning to just to get a GG fig as I don't have one already.

2	Bought an Imperial Landing Craft instead this week as it was on sale, but after this review, GG's fighter is sure to follow soon Benny

2	The set no longer looks as ugly as I've always thought.

2	Thanks for the review - I might have to pick one up now to go with the MagnaGuard Fighter.

3	That's a neat little set.

3	I like the design of the fighter.

3	Thanks for the review - it's been Keep it up KimT

2	Hey, thanks for all the feedback, guys!

2	ill try to do the Sith Infiltrator this weekend.

2	Yesterday I buy this set,and I'm waiting for a pack!

2	This Review is very helpful!

1	Does the sliding cockpit come off easily?

1	My friends brothers breaks everytime you touch it, but he may have built it wrong.

1	It put me off the set.

1	My friends brothers breaks everytime you touch it, but he may have built it wrong.

1	It put me off the set.

1	im very sad to say that SOMETIMES it does.

1	but thats only if you hold it from the top and bottom with your fingers and thumb respectivly.

1	But if you hold it in your palm or from the sides, it wont break.

1	Emphasis on sometimes.

1	But dont try to mess around with it by removing its pieces or adding new one, or modding it in any way, because the sliding mechanism wont agree with the mods and break.

1	But this hardly takes away from anyone liking this set because, IMO, its perfect just how it is.

3	Yeah!

3	General Grievous Starfighter will land in my house!

3	Greate set, i LOVE decals - brown and sandy pattern... ingenious!

3	BTW.

3	When you show Sith Infiltrator Review?

3	I wait... :)

3	Nice work Jim for your first review.

3	I must admit the set didn't really appeal to me at first, but your review has definitely shown off the cool functions built in to this ship, Well Done!

3	Cheers ISC

2	nice review, i bought a couple of these for parts, the only thing i dont like about the ship itself (not the lego version, it does fine) is why is the Grand Droid General flying around in in a small fighter like this, i prefer the battlefront interpretation witch uses it as a bomber.

2	anyway, great review!

2	-York

2	thanks again, you guys.

2	dont worry, the sith infiltrator review will be up this week.

2	My computer has viruses, but now i got FireFox (complete with spell check!

2	), so i should be able to go on the Internet ok from now on.

3	Great review!

3	I would get the set, but I'm saving for the Clone Wars sets.

3	Great set, great review!

3	I have it too and I am very glad to own it!

3	It will probably be the cheapest and best way to get a Grievous fig for a while (even though it doesn't come with a cape ).

3	You guys know that you can use the new robot/skeleton arms from the Castle sets to make him hold his lightsabers horizontically, right?

3	I always have him with two of each kind of arm.

3	Hello all Eurobricks members, I will be doing the second wave of the 2008 Impulse set series, which had released recently.

3	I bought this set earlier ago, and will like to share this comprehensive review with everyone of you.

3	Name: Troll Warrior Theme: LEGO System / Castle Year: 2008 Pieces: 19 Minifigs: 1 An image of a 5618, Troll Warrior Let the march begin The mighty brave troll warrior, carrying a dangerous cart equipped with a "flick" fire missile.

3	Marching into the lands of the Crown Kingdom.

3	Crown Knights must be ready for this new troll addition.

3	From what I see, this set has a very minimum piece count since it's an impulse set.

3	There is no unique parts found in this set.

3	However, this set has a couple of useful accessories, such as 2 spears and 2 wooden wheels and a grey mouse running around.

3	This set is another alternative for Castle Army builders to buy multiple sets, to build a massive Troll armies.

3	In addition, the flick missile really works.

3	Use a little bit of force from your finger and flick it, the missile will fly.

3	Well, it certainly does not impress me at all with such playing feature.

3	Base of the cart Different angles There is one thing I dislike about this set.

3	The wooden wheels are too big, and it is the same as the ones in the Crossbow attack.

3	I prefer the smaller wheels that exist in old castle sets that produced smaller cart.

3	Since this cart size is similar to the old cart size.

3	The old wizard's cart is a very good example of the proposed wheel.

3	Bits and Pieces Close-up on the warrior and the mouse Summary review Playability: 5.5/10 (The playability feature is not fanastic.)

3	Design: 6.5/10 (Design is adequate.

3	If the wheels is much smaller and the flicking thing disappear, the score will be much higher) Price: 8/10 (An inexpensive set to get a troll warrior and a mouse.)

3	Overall: 6/10 (To conclude, this set is good only for army builders.

3	A new range of millitary vehicle to be added.

3	That's all) Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine.

3	Comments and Critics are strongly welcomed.

3	Pictures can be found in My Brickshelf (When moderated) Edited by KimT, 10 August 2008 - 01:29 PM.

3	It's all good...

3	BUT!

3	(I know, you expected a but ) It's a rat.

3	Thanks for the review.

3	Bearing in mind that the whole point of this set is to get a cheap troll warrior, I actually quite like it.

3	The cart isn't brilliant, but for 13 pieces it's not that bad.

3	The troll fig is great as always, and I guess the rats are always nice to get (not so much in real life though).

3	The sets that contain the trolls have a fairly solid number each (I mean, Tower Raid has three!

3	), but nevertheless I think I may have to pick up a few of these.

3	Its a good review but you forgot another thing.

3	THE Troll needs a shiled like they used to in the 2007 castle line the sets always had shields for the minifigs and it could be better if it was 3.00 instead of 3.50 but yes it is a good impulse great army builder.

3	A more affordable troll warrior for those of us avoiding the large sets (me) is always nice!

3	Thanks for the review!

3	God Bless, Nathan

3	Very good, nice to see how its all played out.

3	Nice review!

3	Guys, thanks for your kind comments.

3	I am glad to know that you have enjoyed viewing this review.

3	trooperdavinfelth, on Jul 2 2008, 11:15 PM, said: It's a rat.

3	I thought by calling it as a "Mouse", it will be a little much friendly unlike calling it a rat.

3	I must agreed with the both of you, that this is a much easier way to acquire these troll warriors at a much affordable price.

3	I am glad these trolls are available in Impulse sets.

3	Now, will there will be a dwarf impulse set in the future?

3	I supposed that will be much interesting.

3	If this impulse set includes a troll shield, my rating will defintely go higher.

3	This is a troll army builder set, with minimum feature and limited weapons range.

3	If the troll comes with an armor or a shield, I will think this set is worth it.

3	Troll armor is hard to get by, as it appeared only in Troll Warship and Tower Raid.

3	Edited by Wilhelm screamer, 03 July 2008 - 03:30 AM.

3	Ah, sweet!

3	Thanks for the review, WhiteFang!

3	I hope this set shows up in NZ soon, I can't wait to get my hands on it!

3	Troll Warrior ON!

3	~Peace

2	Hey, your review is great (as usual!!)

2	As for the set itself - well, it's an impulse set after all - small and cheap, nothing special.

2	Well, the rat is special, hehe, for me the rat is the most interesting in the set (cause I don't have a rat).

2	I don't have a troll warrior either, but I'm not very interested.

3	Quote In addition, the flick missile really works.

3	Nice review, i will definately need a few of these!

2	Why is mouse friendlier than rat?

3	Guys, thanks for your kind comments.

3	It seemed most of us here love this impulse set, mainly to build army.

3	Guess, I am a little bit too critic in my review.

3	I was expecting a little bit more!

3	Nevertheless, I intend to buy multiple sets of this and build on my orc armies and split them into different battalions.

3	This is indeed one of the better ways to acquire orcs.

3	Give the new theme a chance.

3	I feel TLG have made an effort to revive certain elements that are present in past castle themes.

3	Although it is not as good as the past, but it is certainly better than the recent castle themes.

3	Shoc, on Jul 4 2008, 01:00 AM, said: Why is mouse friendlier than rat?

3	Well, mouse sounded more friendly, because it can associate with Tom and Jerry.

3	But, calling it a rat equal calling it a pest..

3	It's just a matter of putting it in different terms.

3	That's all.

3	Edit: Instead of posting another post to explain why I used mouse.

3	I will write it here.

3	Tom and Jerry is reflected as a cartoon.

3	Children associate Jerry as a mouse, since its supposed to be heart-warming and make us laugh.

3	In real life, there are many different pets we raised.

3	One of the possible pets we considered is a mouse.

3	Mouse are supposed to be shy and friendly creatures that live in harmony.

3	While rats lived in packs, hunt food in the dark and is widely regarded as a "pest".

3	In this review, I am trying to illustrate rat and associate it with mouse by presenting it in a much friendly approach.

3	There is no right or wrong answer.

3	It's just making use of different words to represent how I feel towards a particular thing.

2	That's all.

2	The thing I dont get is how Jerry is friendly

3	This is a nice way of building up orc armies, but I do wish it was designed like the Knight impulse set.

3	There you have a minifig, enough weapons and armor for two figs and a weapons rack made out of basic pieces.

3	Add a generic fig from your collection and you have two knights and the pieces from the rack can be easily used in MOCs.

3	The pieces that make up the siege weapon in the Orc impulse are not as easy to use in other creations.

3	I'd rather have seen a "Orcish" weapons rack (different from the Knights rack, but like it, using basic elements) with a second helmet, another weapon, the Orc armor and a shield to put on it.

3	Still, although not as good as the Knight impulse, it's a nice little set.

3	While rats lived in packs, hunt food in the dark and is widely regarded as a "pest".

3	Where I come from people keep both as pets.

3	However, if either are found in the house uninvited, they are considered pests.

3	And if you look at the Chinese zodiac, rats are very well thought of and are symbols of prosperity.

3	The Brick Mouse Rat

3	Thank you for the review.

3	The set is nice, I didn't need the flickfire missiles and would have rather a orc/trol shield instead, but I think I will pick one up.

3	Hello all Eurobricks members, I will be doing a continuation of my Impulse set reviews.

3	I was pretty excited when I laid my hands on these new impulse sets yesterday.

3	Hope to give most of you a good insight for this set.

3	Name: Street Cleaner Theme: LEGO System / Town / City Year: 2008 Pieces: 22 Minifigs: 1 An image of a 5620, Street Cleaner Let the cleaning begin The Street Cleaner has a job to do.

3	It is to clean the rubbish on the streets, after a New Year Countdown.

3	It seemed the cleaning agency have a new equipment to use.

3	It's not as big as the previous street sweeper machine.

3	The cleaner will need to operate the equipment manually, by pushing it.

3	Look at the mess After sorting out Look at the pieces offered.

3	It's not a very complicated set, since it's an impulse set.

3	There are some pretty useful parts lying around such as the broom, spade.

3	However, I was quite surprised when I could not find the lid of the rubbish bin.

3	I can't used this rubbish bin to place it around my town, without a lid on top of it.

3	I believed it is not a norm, by not including the lid.

3	Look at that bin Well, that rubbish bin seem to be containing his equipment in it, instead of the rubbish.

3	The cleaner's face looks pretty sad.

3	I think he wants to have a change of job.

3	Front View I love that blue brush very much.

3	Quite fun to play with, especially pushing the rubbish aside.

3	That's why a spade is there to help him to dig out the litter and the broom to brush it away.

3	Ok, now I know why his face looks so sad!

3	Where is that Street Sweeper machine?

3	Summary review Playability: 6.5/10 (Not bad to play with) Design: 7.5/10 (The design is relatively interesting, with the use of the technic part, to be its foundation.)

3	Price: 8/10 (An inexpensive set to get another cleaner and some neat accessories.)

3	Overall: 7/10 (Not a bad set after all.

3	Pretty average, but still quite good to buy if your towns required more cleaners.)

3	Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine.

3	Comments and Critics are strongly welcomed.

3	Pictures can be found in My Brickshelf(When moderated) Edited by WhiteFang, 04 July 2008 - 03:44 PM.

3	Thanks for the review .

3	Not a bad price (of course, its impulse) for a fig, a little cleaner thing, and two accesories.

3	The brush, fig, and spade i dont have yet, so i might just pick this up.

3	Looking at this is making me want to build one of the favourite sets of my childhood, 6649 Street Sweeper (might do that today actually).

3	Cheap.

3	good pieces (despite the lack of a bin lid... that's just inviting disaster isn't it?

3	), nice fig, and one of those blue brushes, which I've always loved but never managed to use.

3	Thanks WhiteFang.

3	Glad you guys like the review.

3	Indeed, a bin without a lid is inviting trouble.

3	Thank you for the nice review.

3	This set looks good.

3	I have too many of the blue sweepthings, but the fig is nice and I didn't have this face, so I will pick up one some day.

3	Wow, what a great little impulse set!

3	I relly dig the face as well as a chance to get some cool accessories like a broom, bin (no lid....sigh) and a mushroom top (Hat).

3	A really nice review and story too Whitefang, i think this guy will be joining my set of Lego when he shows up in Australia.

3	Cheers ISC

3	Thanks for the review!

3	Poor little minifig: This guy has to haul the heavy machine all the way from the depot onto the littered streets to locate some trash, but when he has finally found some and switches on the machine everything will be launched towards his pants.... No wonder he's looking sad.... A nice set though, and inventive too!

3	When it comes to streetsweepers, I remember getting the first of it's kind on my birthday in 1991.

3	Hello all Eurobricks members, I will be doing a continuation of my Impulse set reviews.

3	This will be the third review at a go.

3	Hope everyone of you will find this review useful in a way.

3	Name: Coast Guard Kayak Theme: LEGO System / Town / City Year: 2008 Pieces: 21 Minifigs: 1 An image of a 5621, Coast Guard Kayak Roll Roll, Roll your boat It seemed the coast guard has a kayak of his own, roaming in the sea, making sure that swimmers will be safe in the beach.

3	Now, I am illustrating him as a life guard instead.

3	This set is simply wonderful.

3	Among the 4 new impulse sets, Coast Guard Kayak is the best looking set in my opnion.

3	The kayak design is very simple but looks realistic .

3	Furthermore, if you don't need it to be a coast guard kind of stuff.

3	Use it as a leisure water spot instead down in the marina.

3	I will think any LEGO citizen will love to have some water spot in their busy life.

3	So come down here and wind down with this new sport.

3	Bits and Pieces Kayak and the bouy The bouy is very useful to position it at the coast of your water to highlight the boundaries in the sea, and warning incoming ships or vessels.

3	Oh, I did not make it tilted purposely.

3	There is a white round base which allow it to tilt on both ends.

3	Useful parts These parts are useful to add on in your city.

3	Somehow, when I see that red cone, I can use it as a police stop, to inspect vehicles on the road or form a barricade with it.

3	The bouy base shape is unique too.

3	I like it very much.

3	It is great to attached it by the side of the boat as a life bouy.

3	The coast guard's life vest and helmet are very useful for water activites.

3	The life vest was produced in past sets, and now it re-surfaced again.

3	I am glad these vests made their way back.

3	A look of him, without the life vest Summary review Playability: 7.5/10 (Fun to play with, especially the bouy when you see it moving up and down.)

3	Design: 8.5/10 (Design is simple but straight to the point, especially the kayak design.)

3	Price: 8/10 (An inexpensive set to get more coast guards and more kayaks.)

3	Overall: 8.5/10 (A very good set to have in your LEGO town.

3	The kayak is simply so lovely to me.)

3	Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine.

3	Comments and Critics are strongly welcomed.

3	Thanks for doing these Impulse sets, WhiteFang.

3	This set looks like it has a good number of useful parts.

3	I dont have the minifig torso or head, nor the oar or the life jacket.

3	WhiteFang, on Jul 3 2008, 03:18 AM, said: This set is simply wonderful.

3	You know, that's exactly what I thought.

3	I love it!

3	It's simple, well designed, and cute.

3	There are some nice pieces in there as well, and I really do quite like the fig- the new coastguard torso looks great.

3	Thanks!

3	Excellent review; I like how the new coast guard sets blare out NEW when you see them.

3	Thank you for the nice review.

3	The set is nice, the pieces are nice.

3	And the grey helmet is great for an additional Star wars rebel technician.

3	I really enjoyed your review of the kayak!

3	So many little things in one set that aren't currently in my collection.

3	I didn't even realise it came with a buoy!

3	Cool helmet, lifejacket, face, and oar, I will definitely need one of these!

3	Cheers ISC

3	Hello all Eurobricks members, This will be my last impulse set review for the second wave.

3	Hope everyone of you will find my reviews useful and helpful in your purchase.

3	Name: Crystal Hawk Theme: LEGO System / Mars Mission Year: 2008 Pieces: 26 Minifigs: 1 An image of a 5619, Crystal Hawk Alpha 3 in Sector 5, reporting to base Alpha 3, Crystal Hawk, reporting for duty, Sir!

3	May I present Mars Mission, latest scout craft, code named "Crystal Hawk".

3	This spacecraft looks very sleek and cool with its usual white and orange color combination.

3	I am not a fan of Mars Mission, but these white mini-figs simply attracted me for it.

3	In fact, I only owned its impulse sets, and none of its main sets.

3	Nevertheless, this set has the "swoosh" factor.

3	I was swooshing around in my home last night.

3	Well, I am not swooshing it like KimT though.

3	Am I seeing double?

3	Haha, the answer is "No".

3	It has double sided face.

3	I combined the pictures, to illustrate the two facial expressions.

3	Bits and Pieces Different angles Love the way how the wings bend upwards and downwards.

3	The only thing I find it a little bit wierd for spacecraft.

3	Normally, I thought joystick is the typical navigation controls for a spacecraft instead of a steering wheel?

3	I am not complaining about a steering wheel in a spacecraft.

3	To me, it's quite an uncommon sight.

3	Anyway, the white steering wheel is an useful part for making vehicles MOCs.

3	Summary review Playability: 8/10 (Fun to play with when you bend the wings up and down.)

3	Design: 8.5/10 (Design is simple, but creates a sleek and cool look.)

3	Price: 8/10 (An inexpensive set to get more scout craft and mars mission mini-figs) Overall: 8.5/10 (A very good set to have for any Mars Mission fans, and for collectors like me whom can't afford all Mars Mission sets, this set is a very great alternative.)

3	Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine.

3	Comments and Critics are strongly welcomed.

3	One of the better impulse sets IMO.

2	Thanks for pics.

2	The Hawk, it seems to me, lacks a cockpit, theres not even a seat to keep the pilot from falling off.

2	Perhaps it they'd redesigned it to be a backpack jetpack sort of unit using similar pieces, it'd at least make some sense?

2	Based on the other MM impluses, Can we assume this goes for 3.5$USD?

2	at that price it seems to me, that the Astro Fighter at 5$USD was already a superior impluse set.

2	Guess I'd buy one on clearance, for the minifig.

2	Glad you enjoyed viewing the review.

2	These are some of the improvements which we can do it ourselves to mod it better.

2	I think these are great suggestions.

2	Otherwise, we can add in a white air tank to be included onto the mini-fig.

2	In S@H, Crystal Hawk is priced at USD $3.50.

2	I bought mine at a much expensive price, when you compared it with USD.

2	I never bought the Astro Fighter.

2	I am supposed that it comes with a little bit more parts and an additional alien fig with it.

3	Thanks for another review WhiteFang!

3	This is quite a nice set actually.

3	It evokes some of the design elements of the MX-11, while looking different enough to justify me buying it.

3	The head on the astronaut is one I like, so even better.

3	I hadn't realised it was that one actually.

3	Does 26 pieces make it one of the bigger impulses sets?

3	I think I may have to get one, if not two... Plus it's called 'Crystal Hawk'.

3	How can that not be considered cool?

3	Nice Review good little set probable one of the only impusle sets i will be geting untill/if they make Agents Theme impulse sets And i like the neat double-sided face Edited by Darth_Legois_619, 03 July 2008 - 10:35 AM.

3	Thanks for your comments, guys!

3	I really appericate it.

3	I think I may have to get one, if not two... IMO, Impulse set total piece count should be 30 or less.

3	It will be ideal and more ways to construct a much better impulse sets such as past impulse sets that we came across.

3	I may be wrong, on the 30 piece count thing.

3	But, this is how I view Impulse sets.

3	Brainbox, on Jul 3 2008, 06:11 PM, said: Plus it's called 'Crystal Hawk'.

3	How can that not be considered cool?

3	Do you know I bought this set, mainly because it have such a cool name attached with it.

3	"Crystal Hawk", I simply fell in love with that name.

3	Thanks for the great review.

3	Now I just have to have that set!

3	Thank you for the nice review.

3	This set has a very classic space feeling, so I don't care about the lack of cockpit.

3	A nice little set with a nice minifig.

3	I really like the look of this Impulse set!

3	even though i sold off my MM sets to buy SW i kept my Astro fighter and this impulse set really appealed from the moment i laid eyes on it.

3	I feel the swooshability and cool extras like the double sided face far outweigh the lack of cockpit.

3	Thanks for another great review Whitefang!

3	I like this one aswell, It has a couple of parts i need for an MOC train locomotive and I don't have any of those space guys yet.

3	and a double faced guy is always a winner in my book

3	Once again, another outstanding review by svelte_corps!

3	I am not a very big fan of Agents, but this theme defintely offer plenty of useful parts.

3	This Volcano Base is simply fanastic for parts usage, especially in doing up landscaping, with mountains, by making use of the brown BURPS.

3	I must admit that the exterior looks real cool, but the interior looks rather empty.

3	These orange slopes certainly make a great illustration of the larva, which gives the Agents a hard time to infiltrate within its compound to save his comrade.

3	I am quite sure, this set will defintely attracts lots of kids to coax their parents to buy it, since the bright colors will defintely caught their attention.

3	With all those hi-tech, sleek weaponary, I am sure this is the next big thing for kids out there.

3	Well, I am not sure if this theme works for me as well.

3	But this set defintely works well for landscaping project.

3	Thanks for another great review!

3	I definitely like this set.

3	Sure, the interior might be a bit bare, but I think that the outside of the base with all of the great lava and rocks more than makes up for it.

3	It is a bit weird that on the one side there is nothing on the inside.

3	But that's easy to fix.

3	Anyone know when this will be out in the U.S.?

3	Thanks again for the fantastic review!

3	droool Must buy!!!!!!

3	To Svelte_corps: How on this wonderful planet, did you get that???

3	I thought it was coming in september!!

3	Excellent review SC.

3	Thanks for sharing.

3	The figs are awesome.

3	I really like the female villain - an excellent face.

3	I also like the agent uniforms.

3	The laser gun is perfect.

3	It has that Peter Sellers/Pink Panther dooms day device look that I envision when I think of laser destruction.

3	The volcano has some neat features as well, like the trans.

3	red/orange lava.

3	It is a bit heavy on stickers though, as are many new sets/themes.

3	But overall, I think this set will really appeal to the kids.

3	- A great review of a neat set.

1	Honestly I'm too much of a Space fan to be interested in this set.

1	I'd rather have the sub.

1	Good review though.

1	:D

2	Nice Set Review I really liked the narrative for the Review.

2	I must have missed your Custom Base back in June, also well constructed and great story too!

2	awsome review dude im proably getting this though the main downfall is there is hardly an inside

3	Thanks for the step-by-step!!

3	Set looks great!

3	Mmmmm, Clawdette....

2	Ah, great review!

2	I have always wanted this set since it came out, but with the price, I think I will get the mobile command center first.

2	This will need serious interior mods, like I did with my Dino Attack Chopper(pics soon).

2	GREAT REVIEW!!!

2	Realy Thank you svelte_corps!

2	Maybey you can put al the Agents villains round Dr. Disco Like a sort of dicussionroom or something...Just an idea Undersigned MoWo

3	Thanks for the review svelte_corps, I have yet to purchase an Agent set but I think that will change shortly.

3	I am not a big fan of the stickers but the huge laser gun, the unique minifig design, and beaucoup trans-orange pieces have me sold.

3	I know the word "Secret" base but whats this!

3	The Base is hardly secret with a massive laser gun and wide screen sticking out It looks good, Lots and lots of Orange!

3	Woo!

3	I'm still keeping my money payments until July 26th ...So I won't be able to buy this set unless I get some money prize or something However, I appreciate the review, and hopefully I will get this set sometime in the near future.

3	I just love these new cybernetic arms

3	This will be a wonderful set for a Mustafar MOC

3	Cool set.

3	I got that firearm thing straight away lol.

3	I might get a few of these sets and combine into mustafar.

3	Great review

3	I didn't exactly know where this belongs the best but i think it fits the best in here cause it's somewhat space related.

3	I got this nifty little set yesterday from an auction ebay, new and sealed!

3	I think the rock raiders theme was a great theme, and i wish they would have continues id back then.

3	But anyway, let's see what we got here: Set Nr.

3	: 4910 Name: Hover Scout Number of minifigs: 1 Number of pieces: 39 Release Year: 1999 First, a picture of the little box & instructions: A general overview of the set: And here we have the lovely (?)

3	Miss Jet!

3	(yes, the minifigures had odfficial names in this theme ) The little vehicle: And finally the Crystal Analysis Station.

3	i like that very much, even if it's simple, but it does a good job and the amount of equipment also is cool: That's it, little set, little review, but big fun.

3	I can recommend that to everybody, it's great for the parts, and the minifig is lovely.

3	Gets a 10/10 from me

3	OMG Iamded's torso!

3	[ spoiler] OH MY GOD!!

3	[ /spoiler]

2	excuse me but..what?

3	When I got this set, my first Rock Raiders set, I thought it was the best set I ever had.

3	Maybe that was a little bit of an overstatement, but I like a lot, the pieces mainly, and this is a nice little review!

3	Are92 RoWar, on Jul 10 2008, 08:22 PM, said: OMG Iamded's torso!

3	[ spoiler] OH MY GOD!!

3	[ /spoiler] What would be more appropriate is commenting on Iamded's torso saying "OMG Jet's torso!"

3	Woo!

3	Rock Raiders!

3	Only the best theme ever!

3	(That's right, possibly even better than Castle `07!)

3	Cheers for the review metalandi, hopefully you can inspire others to see the greatness of Rock Raiders too!

3	I love how everything was so simple, yet so effective.

3	It was loads of fun to play with and build the alternate models when I was younger as well (and probably still is ).

3	Do you plan of doing any other reviews?

3	Or do you have any other sets?

3	Rapid Rider is another great small one, adding a bit of diversity with a water-based vehicle, and you get the Bandit minifig.

3	Or you could get The Rock Raiders set, and get all of our spelunking friends (don't make me name them all ).

3	Or, if you want a slightly bigger set, Loader Dozer could be the way to go, Axle's a pretty cool minifig too, and you get a rock monster.

3	Sorry if the last comments were detracting from your review, don't think I didn't like it, becuase it was great!

3	I really hope you can do more!

3	Oh, and yes, my torso does come from a female fig... ~Peace

2	Unfortunately i dont have any other sets yet, i think i got one of the bigger vehicles back in the time, but i don't have any sets from this time anymore.

2	but i certainly plan to get the loader dozer and/or the Chrome Crusher soon.

2	I found an ebay auction where somebody is selling the sets 4940, 4950 and 4970 new & sealed hopefully i have luck with that.

2	It's only at 4 Euros right now, but it's still running 6 days... http://cgi.ebay.de/w...t...A:IT&ih=005

3	Great review .

3	Man, this brings me back!

3	I still have like 5 of those rock monsters.

3	In response to your statement, Rock Raiders does belong in this forum, being everything space related.

3	1) It's on an alien planet 2) In the computer game's start and in the story (yes, there was a computer game-my cousin has it) they are in a space ship 3) There are huge alien rock monsters trying to kill them.

2	Great review and such a nice figure!

2	I consider Rock Raiders space too.

2	I also consider many of the diver themes space as well...

2	I've yet to own a Rock Raiders set.

2	I have tried to buy a few off eBay, but they always went too high...

3	Rock Raiders was one of my favorite LEGO themes ever.

2	I also consider many of the diver themes space as well... Me too.

2	The Rock Raiders are very sci-fi, with the best Lego Space storyline.

2	The Aquazonies would be inner space rather than outer space though, but they look very 'spacey'.

2	7663 Sith Infiltrator Year: 2007 Number of Pieces: 310 Number of Minifigs: 1 Price: 29.99 USD Brickset Hello everyone, and welcome to my second review on Eurobricks, the Sith Infiltrator!

2	Lets start with a pic of the box, shall we?

2	As you can see, its a Limited Edition set, meaning the fig and set could be worth a lot in the future.

2	This set takes about 20 minuets for the seasoned builder.

2	An overview of the Infiltrator (also know as the Scimitar): As seen in the picture, this ship is very sleek, with very few studs on top (SNOT= Studs Not On Top).

2	Basically, Its the cockpit with two wings (with two "fins" on each wing), attached to the hull.

2	Heres a side view of the Scimitar: Very cool- looking!

2	It lands on two "feet" in the front while the cockpit rests on the ground.

2	Rear view: The back.

2	The outer cockpit is beautiful, a printed piece on the back (no dreaded sticker sheet!

2	(DSS)) and a large printed disc on top: Heres a look at the middle: There is a flick-fire missile (trans-red cone attach to Technic pin) on the inner wing, a trans-red lightsaber blade in the back of the hull, and a trans-red lightsaber blade in between the fins on either side.

2	All of those lightsaber blades may come in handy... Hey, look: the fins open from the wings!

2	: The fins open due to double hinges on each fin.

2	Unfortunately, you have to hold the ship up in order for the bottom fins to open.

2	Now, lets have a look inside the cockpit: To open, you lift the back printed part, which is attached to the printed disc on top, which is attached to a hinge.

2	It opens pretty smoothly, but is somewhat loose, so sometimes it closes on its own.

2	Also, the disc isnt secured well enough to the door, and often breaks off, even with the smallest movement to it.

2	Inside, there is an elevated control panel and two sliding pieces near the floor.

2	This ship also comes with a small speeder bike: Its very cleverly built, and is a really neat addition.

2	See that clear disc on the bottom?

2	It fits perfectly into the sliding pieces in the cockpit: Hmm... whats this?

2	: A hidden compartment!

2	Now this was a very cool idea by TLG, a secret compartment found by taking off the top slope of the hull contains Darth Maul's weapons and tools which include: A (CHROME!)

2	lightsaber hilt, a pair of electrobinouculars, and three probe droids.

2	A closeup of a probe droid: Just a plain, black minifig head with a black lever on top.

2	Finally, the fig: Darth Maul in the flesh plastic.

2	A good fig altogether, with a black hood and lightsaber blades taken from the ship.

2	He did come with a crisp, new black cape (packaged in a small, white cardboard box), but I am currently using it for another fig.

2	Note that this is a limited edition fig, so stock up.

2	A comparison pic of the two Mauls: The 2007 version is on the left, and the 1999 version on the right.

2	Note a few key differences between the two: the new one has smaller red tattoos and a smoother torso.

2	Also, the new one has bigger eyes and a more cartoony look.

2	Maul on the speeder bike: Of course, he fits perfectly in the cockpit wile sitting on the bike, and he can reach the controls: Well, thats about it, here is the...

2	FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, easy and fun, breaks every once in a while.

2	Playability: 7/10, this set has many features, but is very fragile between the cockpit and hull and between the two cockpit pieces.

2	Swooshability: 1/10, too fragile to fly around, plus the flick fire missiles fall out.

2	Minifigs: 9/10, a great fig with a chrome hilt and a double sided blade.

2	A little cartoony.

2	Design: 7/10, very clever techniques, very sleek, but very fragile.

2	Price: 8/10, fair enough, could be a few dollars cheaper.

2	Overall Score: 6.5/10, a very sleek ship with clever building and play techniques, but very, very fragile, and shouldnt be picked up off of the shelf too often.

2	And with that, my review is over, but all of yours are not: comments and thoughts very welcome!!

2	Edited by JimButcher, 15 September 2008 - 02:59 AM.

2	This set looks like a dandy.

2	Is the Darth Maul fig any different in respect to the torso or head design to the original?

2	JimButcher, on Jul 10 2008, 09:44 PM, said: A hidden compartment!

2	Now this was a very cool idea by TLG, a secret compartment found by taking off the top slope of the hull You're supposed to slide the front of the hull off, rather than lift the top piece off.

1	I'll be honest - I don't like this ship at all.

1	It's one of my least favourite ships in the PT and I have to yet buy either one of those sets.

1	I also found it funny that this set was meant to be a Walmart exclusive yet never appeared on the shelves at my Walmart.

1	Anyhow, thanks for the review!

2	Led ZePPelin, on Jul 10 2008, 04:46 PM, said: You're supposed to slide the front of the hull off, rather than lift the top piece off.

2	yeah, I was looking at the construction booklet and it reminded me of that (I forgot about it), but that makes it more fragile.

2	Nice review Jim, I think i would only buy this for Darth Maul though you definitely showcased all the cool features really well!

2	I got this set last year.

2	And I think you made a mistake when you have remove a piece to access the probe droids and equipment, you just have to slide the entire main part.

2	And I have a question, is this equipped with the new flick-fire missiles that don't fall off?

2	Yes, I realized the first part .

2	as for the flick-fire missiles, the do fall off very easily.

2	Thank you for the nice review.

2	I like the design, although I didn't want to buy it.

2	The new little speeder is very nice, but maybe a little to small.. Darth Mauls eyes are looking a bit more dangerous now.

1	A very neatly designed Sith Infiltrator, though I think it lacks the size of the older version.

1	A fine ship, but not what I would call a Sith Infiltrator.

1	It should be bigger.

1	Thanks for another fine SW review KimT

3	Hey all!

3	So I purchased the remaining three Agents sets I needed, and saw that there was no review up yet for this set!

3	Heres the first batch of parts, and the first instruction bits.

3	The mini figures.

3	The first small vehicles.

3	Heres a mistake that I found in the instruction booklet.

3	There is no difference between steps 2 and 3.

3	The team Inferno boat.

3	This is a nice chunky boat, that looks fairly heavy duty and evily.

3	Its nice to see the smooth disks on the bottom, that LEGO seemingly havnt done in recent boat/plane sets.

3	And the Agents Submarine!

3	This is a nice build aswell.

3	Nice and long, with a few hidden compartments.

3	One for missiles.

3	A place to put the treasure!

3	Some final shots of the completed set!

3	The spare bits!

3	Another special mention has to go out to Slime Face.

3	I think he is my favourite ever LEGO character.

3	The detail on his unique torso is brilliant!

3	His head is fantastic!

3	And his costume just looks great, with the black and green (Plus green is my favourite colour!)

3	Check out the back of his torso, with the slime pouring down!

3	Deep Sea Quest was £34.99 Price ; 9/10 - This is a pretty reasonable price for a fairly substantial set.

3	Parts ; 8/10 - A lot of nice bits, few nice boats bits, and a lot of smooth disk things.

3	Minifigures ; 10/10 As I said Slime Face is my favourite LEGO character, and the details brilliant!

3	Vehicles ; 8/10 Both very good, with some interesting features.

3	Build ; 8/10 A pretty fun build.

3	Overall ; 9/10 Its gotta be, if just for Slime Face alone, but this really is a great set!

1	I'm not real fond of slimeface.

1	He looks too much like the joker-bombs.

1	I was hoping for something newer.

1	The slime printing is a nice touch though.

1	Steve

3	He does look a bit different though...although it hasnt come out well on the photos, there is some green printed slimey bits on his head aswell.

3	He honestly is amazing.

2	Great review.

2	I love that slime Face !

3	thanks for review...(i hope svelt corps still reviews it ) slime is pretty cool, i knew about the torse for a while but its no less cool now

2	Isn't one review good enough ?

2	Do you just have to be picky .

2	Nice review, by the way .

2	Nice review ReZourceman, I wanted to see one of this set.

2	It seem's there isn't much to it other than what it looks like in the official pictures, but I may well get it.

2	I like Slime Face!

1	Great review, ReZourceman!

1	Your pics really show off the sub well and it's good to see the build in progress.

1	I also have this set but I didn't apply stickers to the sub as I was planning to reuse the nice dark blue pieces.

1	However as shown in your review they do brighten it up a fair bit.

1	I can't say this is my favourite Agents set; the boat is a little oddly proportioned and the sub, although retro looking, has practically no interior and would be difficult to customise to put more in (unlike, say, the clever job Batbrick did with the Penguin sub in his review).

1	The sub kind of looks like some Jules Verneish sea creature - I would have liked it if they'd gone all the way and made it some kind of giant robot jellyfish or squid I do agree with you about Slime Face - he has a fantastic torso with all the slime dripping down which is a bit obscured by the air tank.

1	It's really encouraging that in the last 2 Missions we've had great extra villains added in.

1	The only thing I would add about the octopus is that the glow in the dark plastic is mixed in unevenly with the aqua blue, so it doesn't glow in the dark evenly - it's kind of like the Mars Mission jellies in that respect though much cooler!

1	Thanks again for the great review!

2	svelte_corps, on Jul 11 2008, 09:14 AM, said: I would have liked it if they'd gone all the way and made it some kind of giant robot jellyfish or squid *Cough*AlphaTeam*cough* anyway I was about to reply earlier and say : Great Review svelte then i realised it was not you Nice reveiw anyway!

2	The only reason i would get this set would be if I got all the other Agents sets + all The SW CW sets + all the pieces i need on BL + all the new city ect.. sets....then i would think about geting it

3	Darth_Legois, on Jul 11 2008, 10:28 AM, said: [color="#0000ff"] *Cough*AlphaTeam*cough* I'd forgotten about Ogel's mutant vehicles I guess I meant a bigger cross between the 8636 sub and the big squid from 7775 Aquabase Invasion - that is such a great design.

3	Sort of keep the retro feel but make it bigger.

3	With the 8636 sub, there's really only room for one Agent to sit and despite its size, there's just a few (not amazingly great) functions such as the hidden chest and missiles.

2	I can't see the pics over the glare from my awesomeness!!

2	Thanks for the review ReZ!!

2	I'm jealous you got to snag this right away...

2	Thanks for the review!

2	It's great to see detailed pictures of Slime Face.

2	The set looks good but not as good as some of the others in this line.

2	Great review!

2	I feel like a N00b asking, but what is the USD price?

2	I didn't see a price in the review.

2	It was £34.99 so USD its likely to be $45-$55 I would imagine.

3	Nice review, thanks!

3	TLC is really going all-out with the Agents theme.

3	I wonder if it will last longer than one year (unlike other recent one-and-done themes).

3	My only real criticism of the theme is those freaking stickers.

3	My god, look at the size of that DSS in this set!

2	Great Review!!

2	Really Thanks I Slime Face, Even Slimey as my Slime Sense Nice That Break Jaw is also in it!

2	Undersigned MoWo

3	Great review.

3	This set totally OWNS Alpha Team Deep Sea.

3	The sub design actually LOOKS like a sub, the figures are way better, the acessories are better - everything is better!

3	Agents may have my vote for the best theme of the year.

3	Quote I wonder if it will last longer than one year (unlike other recent one-and-done themes).

3	Oh don't worry - a second wave will be coming next year.

3	This was confirmed by both legomilk and in an interview with an Agents designer.

3	Aside from the price, I love this set!

3	When I saw the prelim pics of Agetns I did not like the theme, but all the sets are starting to look more attractive now I can see the cool features and details!

3	As for this set, I really like the bad-guy boat for some reason and the submarine looks good - I love the dark blue colour.

3	I forgot to comment on this review!

3	Great job ReZourceman, like svelte-corps said your pics really show off the set and what there is to it.

3	I just ordered this and the volcano base off S@h and I can't wait for them to come, so I'll comment on these reviews I forgot about I love the Inferno boat, as you say in your review it looks very heavy duty and ready to take on the Agents.

3	The sub I quite like from the look of it, though there is the problem of too little space I will try and correct that.

3	The dark blue is especially good.

3	And I love Slime Face, his torso is very cool.

3	I'm guessing he's a mutant Inferno creature.

3	About Slime Face, is his head much different to the Joker bombs?

3	I know he has slime marks on his head, are they very apparent?

3	Thanks again for the review!

3	Batbrick Away!

2	Batbrick, on Jul 19 2008, 09:53 AM, said: Is it impossible or just very hard to mod?

2	Nothing is impossible to mod!

2	Probably the easiest part to change would be the front where the missiles are and the treasure chest slides out - you could make a sizeable compartment there.

2	However the middle section is so narrow and the end fins are just that - fins - that it might be harder to expand without changing the shape of the sub.

2	You'll find out soon when yours arrives!

2	I'm guessing he's a mutant Inferno creature.

2	About Slime Face, is his head much different to the Joker bombs?

2	I know he has slime marks on his head, are they very apparent?

2	It's not really clear but since all the other mutants are evil (or at least controlled by Dr Inferno), it's probably a safe bet the squid is too.

2	Slime Face's head is different to the Joker bombs - different eyes and teeth (although the smile is similar I guess) and the slime marks are much more apparent in the flesh (or ABS) although they don't photograph that way.

2	Joker bomb face below for contrast:

2	Probably the easiest part to change would be the front where the missiles are and the treasure chest slides out - you could make a sizeable compartment there.

2	However the middle section is so narrow and the end fins are just that - fins - that it might be harder to expand without changing the shape of the sub.

2	You'll find out soon when yours arrives!

2	Thanks for that info, I will definitely try anyway when I get the set, see if I can't loosen up a few dark blue bricks at the same time!

2	I hope the slime looks good when I get him!

2	Batbrick Away!

3	Wow, thanks for the review, that is one awesome set, Slime Face is excellent!

3	I must add him to the collection, I think we need some new agents, there's so many Inferno minifigures now... Maybe next year?

3	thanks again!

3	Inertia, on Jul 21 2008, 12:29 PM, said: Wow, thanks for the review, that is one awesome set, I think we need some new agents, there's so many Inferno minifigures now... Maybe next year?

3	There's only 2 Infernos out of 8 sets which is pretty good.

3	There's way more Agent Chases and Break Jaws.

3	I agree though, next year hopefully we'll have some new figs.

3	Great looking set.

3	And that glowy blue octopus is really cute, I might just get it for that.

3	Be great in a Space moc..

3	Wondering, from the pdf instructions I saw, it wasnt clear what the Agent in the sub is sitting on, hows his seat work?

3	and it looks like theres a compartment below him...

2	Great review I just thought I'd comment saying thanks because if I had'nt found this review I'd of never made an account on eurobricks!

3	6927 All Terrain Vehicle Year Released: 1981 Piece Count: 167 Minifigs: 2 List Price: $14.50 A very unique vehicle in the Classic Space collection was this "All-Terrain Vehicle" which I always considered more along the line of a Mobile Lab.

3	The set introduced/infused white and black bricks with classic blue space pieces.

3	The result was this great classic vehicle.

3	The set includes two figs (still red and white): Here's a view of the vehicle which is really two components, the vehicle itself and the lab section: I absolutely loved the the blue windshield slopes (2 included), and the unique upside-down large blue slope: In the back of the vehicle is the blue lab: The back section of the vehicle has hinges that allow the jets sections to open: The brick design fits perfectly into the lab, and when opened, the lab falls to the ground: NOTE: the little round trans.

3	red 1x1s allow the lab to slide up and forward when the jet sections are closed.

3	I tried taking off the red 1x1s and the lab does not lift as easily with them.

3	The design is very clever, esp.

3	for a classic set.

3	Here's a shot of the stand-alone lab: Unlike earlier Classic Space windows, this set has train window frames with yellow windows.

3	The top of the lab lifts up for playability: Inside the lab are several computers and a swivel chair: Back to the vehicle, here's a shot of the cockpit with white steering wheel: The left side has an upside-down wrench and black antenna: The right side, a walkie-talkie and another antenna.

3	The antennas can be used as breaks to keep the middle wheels from moving: Here's ashot of the under carriage: And a final shot of the complete set: For those of you following my Classic Space reviews, this is review number 9 of 10.

3	My final review of an-all time favorite will be coming soon.

3	Hope you enjoyed this review.

3	Comments are always welcome.

2	No more of your great reviews?

2	Why?

2	A good review right here, got into the thick of the set without becoming boring with an absence of pictures or not having enough text.

2	This looks like a good set and I'd better catch up with the rest of your reviews, ASAP!

3	Thanks for the review.

3	This is one of my favorite space sets of all time.

3	I even had 2 of them back in the days.

3	My only complain about this set was that I found that the wheels where too small , I had some trouble passing the rover over the little "craters-mountains" of the space plates

3	This is a great little set.

3	I like how it combines two very different color schemes for different parts of the model.

3	I have made some slight modifications to mine, adding a roof on the vehicle and a back wall on the outpost.

3	Also, those white 1x1 headlight plates at the front are thinner than the modern kind and seem to be quite weak.

3	I got this set off ebay a while ago and one of them was broken in shipping, even though the set was otherwise in display model condition, and the other one broke off while I was building the set.

3	I replaced them with the newer variety.

3	It can't even roll over a single plate's height.

3	Not very "All Terrain" at all.

3	Thanks for another informative review of the best Lego theme ever, and not in attempt to hijack your thread but to add to it, here's a pic of my blacktron 1 version of this beautiful set.

3	the 6927 has to rate as one of the best 5 classic space sets ever along with 918, 6970 and 928.

3	Give me an excuse to sneak into your house, and let me have a feel of these Classic Space sets.

3	I never had a chance to have any experience with the Classic Space sets.

3	Through your recent reviews on these, it gave me a wider perspective of space.

3	I loved to play space as a child such as the late classic and Futuron sets.

3	Back to the review, this 6927 is a great mobile command center vehicle suitable for all kinds of harsh terrain in the unknown space.

3	The 6 big wheels are real solid and firm back in those days.

3	Transparent blue windscreen at the front, is wonderful.

3	I just love these parts, especially when it's in blue.

3	4 computer printed tiles.

3	Aren't LEGO so generous back in those days, when printed parts are more commonly available unlike now.

3	It's a real nice set.

3	However, there is one thing I don't understand about this design.

3	Why is the driver seat has a wide back with no cover behind?

3	And, the command center has no door at the back?

3	I understand that these Space guys are always carrying their helmet around, for oxygen supply.

3	I wonder if there is a better answer to it.

3	I've exhausted my collection of classic space sets.

3	I'd love to keep them going, but just one more set.

3	The playability is great!

3	I agree with you as I never thought this was much of an all-terrain vehicle with the wheel construction.

3	The bottom of the vehicle would always touch the bottom of non-smooth surfaces.

3	The wheels do need to be bigger (but I still like them).

3	It makes taking them off a lot easier.

3	As for the lab/control center, I never had an issue with it being open.

3	I think this was just for playability.

3	One could always "pretend" that some sort of invisible force ray closed the side when activated.

3	Great comments!

3	I love hearing what others think of these classics.

3	Oh man, this review takes me back!

3	I got this set when I was 8 years old, and LOVED it.

3	I remember modding it to remove the lab in the back, and I put in a giant laser cannon instead.

3	'Cause when you're 8 years old, everything needs a giant laser cannon.

3	HA!

3	Very true.

3	The vehicle is built so low to the ground that the front end catches on everything.

2	Quote Great buy on this one.

2	What did it cost you?

2	It was $30, which was a pretty good price given the condition.

2	It had no box or instructions though.

2	This set is actually fairly common on ebay though, considering how old it is.

2	I see them pretty frequently on there.

2	Invisible force field/ray?

2	That is a very neat idea.

2	I don't have much problem with it either.

2	Was just curious about the design, as I am not very familar with Classic Space.

2	I supposed the oxygen tanks is quite big to carry around, especially when the vehicle is so cramped.

2	These allowance of space, makes them much mobile to move about in the vehicle.

2	CP5670, on Jul 12 2008, 02:39 AM, said: I just modified mine to make everything fully enclosed: Great job!

2	Thanks for sharing and answering the question I posted above.

2	I love the way you modify the front and back.

2	Now, I need to find where is the entrance to the Mobile Command Center.

3	i've always associated this set with 6929, the Voyager.

3	they're of the same timeframe and more or less the same style.

3	6927 is without any doubt my favourite ground vehicle of space.

3	it was pretty simple, but it was such a creative set.

3	the stories you could tell with this model... g... most defenitely in my top 5 of space sets...

3	This set never got me as a kid.

3	I suspect it was because of the wheels; I had mostly Basic sets so it would have been more of the same.

3	Looking at it now I can see I have misjudged it, and I love the lab-lift method.

3	I'm going to have to build this to see it in action!

3	Thanks for another great review.

2	Great review!

2	All-Terrain Vehicle was one of my two favorite LEGO sets ever.

2	I have to include a shot of the back of the box, because I love the ideas LEGO provided for this set: hewman, on Jul 11 2008, 01:11 AM, said: Very nice Blacktron-themed 6927!

2	CP5670, on Jul 11 2008, 01:39 PM, said: I just modified mine to make everything fully enclosed: I love your modified 6927 with the enclosed front.

2	2 weeks ago I modified my All-Terrain Vehicle as well, in a similar way, but just *slightly* more modified from the original.

2	I call it: 6927-C 'All-Terrain Vehicle Improved Class' a few clues for anyone to easily build this themselves: Also, a much more extensive modification/MOC that I call 6927-W "All-Terrain Warrior" Quote 6927-W 'All-Terrain Warrior' I wanted to make a combat variant of 6927, so I used the 6927-C Improved Class as the starting point and went from there.

2	I added a completely new forward-cab, close to the ground, for a ground--observer to monitor the terrain.

2	I added even larger wheels, allowing this variant to truly be "all terrain", ...besides, what good is it having a combat vehicle if it gets stuck in the middle of a firefight?

2	The 6927-W has a five man crew: a driver, a gunner who also serves as overall-commander, a terrain observer in the very front.

2	In the lab are the weapons systems officer and computer/tech specialist.

2	The All-Terrain Warrior vehicle portion is armed with lasers and blaster cannons, with options for other weapons.

2	There are short-range nuclear rockets on the lab, guided by the rader control.

2	The lab now has blast-proof shutters on the windows protecting the crew from rocket blast.

2	Additional protection can be added to the lab, if-need-be, such as more extensive blast-shielding.

2	All-in-all, the All-Terrain Warrior is a beast of a machine.

2	Two 6927s can protect an entire convoy of standard 6927 or 6927-C.

2	These are my very first attempts at modification and doing a MOC of Classic Space LEGO!

3	Awesome review Brickster!

3	I didn't you are also a Space fan Oh how I love Classic Space The all time perfect LEGO space related theme Everytime I see one I want to buy them more and more, when compared to modern fang dangled sets with detailed figs and cool new accessories, they have nothing on Classic Space, simple beauty Maybe its the blue/grey/trans yellow color scheme Classic Space Forever Edited by Piranha, 30 August 2009 - 07:51 AM.

2	Wow!

2	That brings back memories.

2	I have that model too (in storage somewhere).

2	The pictures are great.

2	I will definitely be checking out more of your reviews.

3	Yeah, first time that I am getting a set before everyone.^^ First of all: The package The european version has no "Limited Edition" button.

3	Hooray!!!

3	Sorry for the blurry back-shot.

3	We see the hospital back, a few bubbles with set functions and a little comic.

3	Comic: Bubbles: The figures are injured Spongebob, Patrick and the new Fish Doctor.

3	Spongebob has a headprint... ...and a backprint (other than the normal Spongebob).

3	Spongebob and injured Bob: The set comes with two litters.

3	The ambulance car is a bit extraordinary.

3	I don´t know how the car is like in the show (and I saw a lot of episodes) but it looks a bit strange, mostly because the weehls are too small.

3	Of course we get another SS (not so D this time).

3	The litter fits in the back, with help of this lid.

3	I wish it would be the hinge-lid from before 2004... Now we come to the meanpart of the set: The hospital!

3	The entrance has got babyblue traindoors and a hudge sign that shows "Emergency".

3	The tubes are nearly everywhere in this set.

3	I was getting insane when I came to the part, where I must put the stickers on the tubes.

3	This parts are very usefull, but I wanted that the set looks good, because I will display it.

3	So I stickered just two of the parts and not all four.

3	Now we come to the interroir: The doctor has a desk with computer.

3	Sadly it´s not very well placed and he must duck because of his fin.

3	Next to the door, we get this little case, wash basin and two drawers.

3	Again we get stickers... Not that I don´t like stickers.

3	It´s just: Everytime I get to the part where I must put the stickers on, I think how I can re-use the model and if I rebuild the model, later and and and...

3	I hate it to deside!

3	A few posters are in it, too.

3	The set is a great addittion to your own Bikino Bottom, but the playability is not very big for the kids.

3	They can just play that Patrick steals the ambulance car, like shown on the package, and is hitting Spongebob.

3	Than the drive back, the doctor gives Spongebob two medicines and let him go.

3	I bought the set mostly because of the parts (tubes in lightbley and a few woodpieces).

3	But I am thinking about let it stand in my little Bikini Bottom (just consist of Crusty Crab and Chum Bucket).

3	Playability: 3/10 Figures: 10/10 Price: 8/10 Design: 9/10 TOTAL: 30/40

3	Thanks for the review, looks like a great set.

3	I'm surprised that spongebob's bandage has a full body headprint so kudos to lego for that

2	oh so spongebob was the injured one.

2	I thought this set depicted the episode wherein Mr. Krabs was the one rushed to the hospital.

3	I love the Sponge Bob sets, I have all of them!

3	Nice review.

3	Thanks for the review!

3	The interior looks nice, better than I expected, Lots of great parts but, as you say, so many of them are stickered.

3	After Rocket Ride, the stickers in the SB sets seem to have gone crazy - the early sets weren't slathered in them.

3	2 new figs though is most welcome.

2	Great review.

2	As much as I hate spongebob LEGO, I just might get this set.

2	It has a good number of useful parts, like the computer and keyboard, and all of the brown pieces.

2	How much does this set cost in USD?

2	Great review!

2	I want that set, mainly for patric and the spongebob with the bandage.

2	BUT: Why does bob have full length pants?

2	I thought he wore briefs?

3	lots of yummy pics in the review thanks!

3	hmm a double sidied minifig, with a painted top!

3	thats the first time i have ever seen this done!?!?

3	this is a great set and has recieved as evideneced by a lot of "is it new" questions, is sponge bob sets available in Auzzi land?

3	i have not seen them in shops...

3	Regards Cpt.

3	PB

3	How much euro did you pay for it?

3	It looks a great set, great interior, nice figures and funny posters.

3	:) It's also nice: the newest Spongebob sets are now also available in our stores and they are the coolest (Belgium)!

2	Cpt.

2	PB Generally not, although as a special sale promotion Target has 3830 Bikini Bottom Express and 3831 Rocket Ride available now (although the sale starts 24 July for 20% off) and K-Mart briefly had the Krusty Krab set last year.

2	I ordered the set via S@H and it cost 34.99€ in Germany, 37.99€ in Belgium and 50$ in Australia.

2	It looks like it´s a exclusive set, but without the 2limited edition" sticker on the package.

2	In the USA it´s not aviable, now.

2	I think it costs as much as the rocket ride (30$).

2	@ Mrs Pegleg: He has the same, short pants, like in the other sets.

3	Nice review, the set looks promising.

3	Wow, that set looks better than I thought!

3	I just might get it if its under $30 USD.

3	I love all the details inside, and it seems to have a better interior than the City hospital... and the new figs look nice...

3	Thanks for the pics, this set is necessary for each Spongebob-fan, it looks so great

1	The fish doctor is supposed to have a new torso.

3	Ronan Nissen, on Jul 15 2008, 07:09 AM, said: The fish doctor is supposed to have a new torso.

3	Says who?

3	I think the one he has is fine...

2	I never have buy a Sponge Bob set but this looks so cool so maybe... (Just maybe) I will buy it .

2	I am curious of why TLC haven´t done the Flying Dutchman ship, it was in the first rumor list of Sponge Bob sets, that surely will be a must .

3	Awesome, light blue train doors.

3	Yummy!

3	It is quite strange that spongbob has become the best source for train parts: the baby blue doors, the orange round windows ,...

3	The official name for this Lego set is "The Emergency Room".

3	I have all the other SpongeBob sets, including three Krusty Krabs, two Bikini Bottoms, as well as one of everything else , now all I need to do is wait until next month to buy this set if I find it at my local Toys "R" Us.

3	That SpongeBob minifig looks cute.

3	I'm not a huge fan of spongebob, but this set I might want also have.

3	Maybe I can combine it with the city hospital.

2	This set doesn't have much playability, but the hospital is better than the one released by lego recently.

2	it has more detail.

2	i like it.

3	Thanks Navy Trooper Fenson for the review - good one !

3	I really like that SB is printed!

3	I will need to get this one when I go to the US in two weeks.

3	CopMike

3	Nice review, NFT!

3	I´m not that much into SpongeBob, but these two pieces just for themselves are interesting to get: container cupboard 4532 and cupboard drawer 4536 the latter not being sold for the last 6 years!

3	Both together are an excellent way to create detailed interiors.

3	6 of those for me, please!

3	There's a lot great pieces in this set, I would be willing to get the set just for them.

3	Thanks for the great review!

2	My fish doctor has the torso from 7902 Doctor's Car, which is unfortunate, because the other torso is more stylized and cartoonish, I think.

2	However, I did have that mad scientist lab set, so a bit of digging through my old collection will hopefully yield the better torso.

1	I recently bought this set for my daughters birthday.

1	It's the first BELVILLE set that I've bought for her so it's a bit of an experiment.

1	The house is 5 rooms and it's made up of mostly large pieces.

1	There still is a decent amount of normal LEGO in it though.

1	The doorways in the house align when it is opened out.

1	Starting with the bathroom, included is a shower, toilet, sink with vanity and a baby potty.

1	The mirror sticker is one of the few that I put on.

1	The open plan lounge/kitchen/dining room is well appointed as well and it has a nice glass table and coffee machine.

1	The kitchen chairs are Fabuland parts... and don't work really well.

1	It seems they are having jellyfish for dinner!

1	The clock is the only printed part in the set.

1	Upstairs is a baby room and the master bedroom.

1	The radio and the TV (not shown) were stickers to my disappointment.

1	Up top is an extra room suitable for reading.

1	(Those antenna things were made from spare parts by my daughter.

1	I have no idea what they are supposed to be... ) There are some stickers that go on the back, but I didn't put them on.

1	As it is the set looks OK this way, but since it is a dolls house it doesn't really matter.

1	I do think though that the fireplace should have been given a back.

1	The BBQ is made from normal parts and is quite effective.

1	I think it uses the same light brick that's in the 4998 Stegosaurus set.

1	My kids were using it as a torch before my grumbling ruined their fun... Like all BELVILLE sets, the highlight is arguably the accessories.

1	I'll be borrowing a few of these from time to time...

1	Here is the controversial baby catapult.

1	As you can see, it works OK, but LEGO probably should have tried a bit harder.

1	We also bought for her 7583 Playful Puppy.

1	It also comes with some nice accessories, but not enough to justify buying unless you want the rest of the parts.

1	Poor puppy; where does he sleep?

1	Here is my daughter assembling it.

1	She made me make the house though as she wanted to play a game we bought her.

1	(Note the LEGO drink bottles! )

1	I didn't take any photos of the figures as they don't seem to be anything new, but I can if people want me to.

1	At the time I was in bit of a hurry as I took these before bed so I wouldn't be stressed if the kids broke it the next day.

1	Overall, these sets seem overpriced to me, and hard to justify unless you actually want a buildable doll's house.

1	(Which we did.)

1	It's still too early to tell if my daughter likes it or not... but at this stage it seems she lost interest in a few days.

1	She does tend to go back to toys though.

2	mommy and daddy are naughty!

2	Yay!

2	It's good to see your kids get to build some stuff too, Sinner .

2	All through the review I was thinking 'This was a present - but who actually put it together?'

2	so I'm glad the last pic cleared things up As for the set - it looks much bigger than I expected - I think it does make a good sized dollhouse.

2	There are a stack of nice pieces in there - cupboards, oven, trans-blue 2x5 bricks, all the accessories, plants, flowers, food, the light-up brick, the pink roof slopes - but not enough to justify the $AUD129 retail price.

2	Maybe on sale I'd pick it up and resell the Belville figs but David Jones hasn't even had a regular 20% off Lego sale for the whole of this year that I've seen.

2	I think the Playful Puppy set is a horrendous ripoff for $AUD20 though.

2	I agree with the baby catapult - the range is terrible.

2	Lego just isn't trying any more, is it?

2	At least they've moved on from throwing cats off three storey buildings.

2	2 questions though.

2	1) Was it a fun build?

2	2) Are those large figs anatomically correct under their frou-frou finery?

2	If not, what the hell are they doing in the second pic whilst baby Sylvia explores the oven?

3	Excellent review!

3	It's nice to see how... it's nice to see how ... ... it's nice ...

3	Okay, I can't get over the sex in the bedroom and the unattended baby crawling into the oven.

3	I didn't read anything else except, where does the puppy sleep and my daughter made me build this.

3	You are sick and twisted and that's why I love you!

3	It seems you are coining the Belville edge.

3	Now will you please stop sitting around eating clams and get that baby out of the oven or make the fun in the bedroom a three-way?

3	Please!

3	Thank you PS.

3	OK, I read it.

3	I want the baby toilet and I think the jellyfish is supposed to be a jello-mold.

3	I bet you knew that.

3	The fireplace lattice look like the Harry Potter one and not the Fabuland one.

3	Boo!!

3	Wienies.

3	When your daughter outgrows it, will you turn it into a Belleville Star Wars MOC please?

3	Thank you in advance

3	Baby catapult you say?

3	Puts a basenet to shame!

3	Top review by the way, lego drink bottles for the win!

3	Edited by Mrs Pegleg Blockbeard, 12 July 2008 - 06:37 AM.

3	Great review, and i note something like a bucket in the dog set... shame its not blue... As for the fire place piece i love it and i want one, ever since finding it on MLcad!!!

3	I love the BBQ, it looks so good!, you know i might even buy this, it it was not so pink!

3	Now as for the kiddies, in ovens, make sure they are not over cooked they can be stringy , and as for the couple up stairs, now we at least know what you do with your mini figs when no one is looking/ lego sets in public places , just following your name sake i guess And i must say Lego, shame, shame, that catapult needs reviwing, hardly even make a dent in a castle wall!

3	Regards Cpt.

3	PB

2	I was sort of hoping for a flick-fire baby.

2	Still, this looks decent, for what it is, I guess.

2	Obviously, it really is all about the accessories, and it's got 'em, but not enough to make me spend that kind of cash, and I don't even mind having a pile of pink parts around.

2	If you throw in a complete turkey or some birthday cakes, it's a slam dunk, but as it is... eh.

2	Thanks for the review, though, it's very nicely presented and leaves no doubt in my mind as to just how easy this set would be to misuse for other purposes.

3	Nice review, good to see your almost letting your kids play with your lego I like the functionality of the baby catapult, its good that they include some working features in a build this big!

3	Are you not showing the figures because its really Hugh Hefners Playboy/Belville Mansion?

3	I dont see the grotto though, must be an add on set like the poor puppy!

3	Its just so darn PINK

2	The LEGO lives on!!

2	But you are one evil parent, getting your kids addicted to Belville like that!

2	But uh... whats that doll doing on the bed?

2	Whats underneath it...?

2	And look what you found... a bucket!

2	Great review Sinner, I haven't seen a Bellville set review before!

2	I just realised what you meant by 'fore' in the topic subtitle, too.

2	I agree, a lot of the pieces are good but I don't think I would get it.

2	However, I do think I will get the set with the dogs, so my minifigs can have giant mutant hounds!

2	JimButcher, on Jul 12 2008, 06:45 PM, said: And look what you found... a bucket!

2	A bucket, in disguise as a watering can...

3	A nice review with a nice touch of Sinner which made me laugh.

3	The playfull puppy set has saussages I think I would buy a playfull puppy, It has nice pieces and the puppy can also be used for minifigs as a big dog.

3	Why haven't they not made a saussagesseller for City.

3	Maybe in the future.

3	There are already more chickenlegs in minifigs sets.

2	This reminds me of that popular TV game show in the States: Identify the Bucket vs. the Watering Pale.

2	I was on that, came close to winning too, but the one I picked was too well tanned.

2	Wah-wah-waaaaaah.

3	Sinner!!!

3	You know, I had never seen a BELVILLE set in any review with such great pictures before!

3	I just can't take my eyes off, in the Master Bedroom.

3	The scene is quite, a little hot.

3	Enough of me, peeping up there.

3	Let's take a look at the interior.

3	I am very surprised by its construction of the house.

3	It's quite big and is nice of you to buy a great sweet gift for your daughter.

3	I am very sure, she will enjoyed playing with it.

3	Somehow, it reminded me of Barbie Doll products.

3	Maybe, its too pinkish for me.

3	The accessories is the "plus factor" in any BELVILLE sets.

3	It offered quite a handful of great accessories to add into any types of MOCs construction to add in the plus factor in it.

3	Sinner, you are a very nice Dad!

3	I like how parents, buy educational toys for their children to expand their imaginations instead of sitting in a couch playing video games and etc.

3	Aw, Sinners' playing with toys again!

3	Great review!

3	The set is good for parts it appears.

3	And that bedroom scene is...interesting.

3	Thanks for your report and the pics, my sister wants this set, but she's already got the last house And she doesn't play very often with it, but the new one looks very good, too

2	The kitchen stove is smart though.

2	As for the figs, yes I forgot to add pictures of the happy couple!

2	Here they are.

2	She played with it a lot this week, but last week she ignored it... and I had to fix it twice!

2	I'm confused... the finale of Big Brother Australia was last week.

2	So why only now are we seeing pictures of housemates Brigette and Ben performing a striptease?

2	And where is Rory in his signature g-string?

2	Very odd.

3	Sinner, on Jul 25 2008, 09:47 PM, said: I'm still undecided on if it was a smart buy.

3	She played with it a lot this week, but last week she ignored it... and I had to fix it twice!

3	My daughter is 12, and she still plays with all her Belville stuff (mostly the fairy princess castle sets).

3	If your daughter is anything like mine, you will definitely get your money's worth out of it.

3	However ... as soon as my daughter says she's done with it, I plan on raiding the sets for all those great food and accessory bits.

3	Patience .... Great review, by the way.

3	The Belville sets are indeed overpriced, but they're probably Lego's best attempt at wooing the girl audience (I still hate the fact that TLC thinks they need separate "boy" themes and "girl" themes, but whatever).

3	They're a very nice alternative to Barbie -- you get posable figures with realistic body proportions, plus some creativity and building aspects thrown in.

3	I bought this today, mainly because it was 25% off, but I'd been eyeing it for a long time.

3	The accessories truly are brilliant!

3	There's so much here to be pillaged for other uses, as people have said.

3	I picked up heaps of new parts I've never had, or rare ones in even rarer colours.

3	To be honest, I was surprised and impressed by the range and versatility of the regular bricks as well.

3	When you look at the box art, what jumps out at you are the giant pink walls and curved pieces, but there's a nice amount of white arches and lime green bricks, not to mention all the windows and the trans blue 1x2x5 bricks.

3	And plants!

3	It's a good thing the target audience likes stickers though, there's more here than I've seen on any set except the 7709 Sentai Fortress!

3	I think they were aiming for one sticker per page of instructions I hope Belville returns in 2010 Thanks for the review, Sieggy!

3	Did your daughter ever go back to it?

2	svelte_corps, on May 23 2009, 04:54 PM, said: Did your daughter ever go back to it?

2	On and off.

2	She's been building (very odd) spaceships with the big pink pieces.

2	Siegfried, on May 23 2009, 07:02 PM, said: On and off.

2	She's been building (very odd) spaceships with the big pink pieces.

2	It will go nicely with your alien dump truck!

2	I recognize the clock!

2	It came with my old airport set 6392 back in 85!

2	In fact according to Peeron it mostly came out in train stations Link Belville looks horrible to me Too barbie-ish and does not look Lego at all.

2	Would prefer they went with Paradisa instead.

2	paanjang16, on Jun 17 2009, 11:25 PM, said: Belville looks horrible to me Too barbie-ish and does not look Lego at all.

3	7655: Clone Battle Pack Year: 2007 Number of pieces: 58 Number of minifigs: 4 Price: 9.99 USD Brickset Welcome to my third review on Eurobricks, I hope you enjoy!

3	While at any store that sells LEGO (Target, Wal-Mart, TRU, etc.

3	), you will notice that the clone battle packs on the shelf are way fewer in number than the droids battle pack.

3	As you might guess, the clones are way more popular, and finding them gets harder and harder as the release date of this set goes farther into the past.

3	So stock up!

3	Alright, heres a pic of the box: A small box, as expected for inexpensive sets like these.

3	Note the "Build your army" button on the front: TLG obviously is encouraging customers to buy multiples, and with good reason, which will be explained later in this review.

3	Well, lets get straight to it: The contents of this set.

3	You will notice a speeder bike, a gun turret, and some clones.

3	Looking good so far!

3	Lets have a look at the turret: An excellent Star Wars element to have around, especially for MOCing.

3	It is very cleverly built, using a tire guard from CITY sets for the general shape of the turret mount.

3	All you have to do is attach the (new mold!

3	explained later) gun to the 2x1 plate with the center stud, and... Presto!

3	I wonder how the clones build these turrets to fast in the middle of battle... A rear view: With a clone mounted: My only gripe about the turret is that you have to take off the gun in order for every clone to have a gun.

3	Now, we move on to the vehicle of the set, the speeder bike: A rather sleek and good looking bike, with some useful pieces on it as well, such as the blue cones, the megaphones, and the engines.

3	Some say it looks bare without the figs mounted on it, but I think it looks just fine.

3	The commander drives while a trooper shoots on the back.

3	A side view: And a rear view: My only gripe is the same as the turret: you have to remove the back gun for all the clones to have weapons while on foot.

3	The back pistol attaches to a 2x2 round studded plate with a Technic hole in the middle.

3	Finnaly, here are the new guns: This set comes with 1 new blaster rifle and three new pistols.

3	It could have included one more rifle for the turret.

3	And of course, the figs: Includes: 1 yellow commander (lovely fig), 1 Shocktrooper (comes with a pair of elctrobinouculars), and two regular troopers (so clean and white).

3	The figs are excellent, all that any SW or LEGO fan should want.

3	It could have maybe included one more regular trooper, but that might be pushing it.

3	Thats all for now, folks, here is the...

3	FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, extremely easy, should take the seasoned builder about 5 minutes to complete.

3	A fun build, though.

3	Playability: 5/10, I guess you can get this with the droid battle pack and make them battle, but this set has no real play features of its own.

3	But it is good for collecting troops and using them for MOCs.

3	Swooshability: 9/10, I guess you can zoom the speeder bike around... Minifigs: 10/10, four great figs that should be bought in multiples, a great army builder.

3	Design: 10/10, a clever turret, an awesome speeder, and four great clones.

3	What more do you need in a 10 dollar set?

3	Price: 8/10, not bad I suppose, but if you calculate a dime for each piece, this set should come out to 5-6 dollars.

3	But still, billions of these are being sold world-wide, and TLG is making a ton of money off of them.

3	Overall score: 9.5/10, a truly memorable set, one that will be a favorite for ages to come, and very popular.

3	A great army builder for a small price, plus vehicle and turret!

3	With only a few very minor flaws, this set is one of the best of Star Wars.

3	And this concludes my review, and as always, comments are most welcome.

3	I got like 5 of theses Hope we get the New clone battlepack, Do you ever think we will?

3	We will only get 5 Clones if you buy all the New Republic sets...

3	Nice review!

3	I got over the gun problem with the shockie since the rebel in the Y-Wing doesn't need one.

3	I wish I could have gotten more of these but I'll know for next time.

3	When I saw this topic I was like : "Oh my god this set is out since 2007.

3	This guy is so late!"

3	but I read your review and this idea got out of my mind!

3	Thank you Jim!

3	I have 2 of these and I even have twice more droids than clones!

3	I should have buy more but it's sold out now

3	Nice review JimButcher , this set is for many reasons awesome but unfortunately I just buy one.

3	Now I am planning on buying one more in my wal-mart there are like three in stock but with a high price of $19.99 each so maybe just one and will keep it MISB .

2	Sooner or later I'll have six sets of this.

2	Yet another fine review Your getting my fingers bleeding from all this updating the review index Keep doing that - reviewing that is.

2	KimT

2	I believe there's another set that has Star Corps Trooper with an orange pauldron.

2	Is it any better?

3	7654: Droids Battle Pack.

3	Year: 2007 Number of pieces: 102 Number of minifigs: 7 Price: 9.99 USD Brickset Hi everybody, and welcome to my fourth review on Eurobricks.

3	Today, I will review the Droid Bttle Pack set.

3	NOTE: This set originally came with four megaphone blasters for each battle droid, but I replaced them (along with the crooked arms) with the new blaster pistols and new twisted arms.

3	A picture of the box: As it is on the shelves of major-retail stores.

3	A small box, as expected for inexpensive sets like these.

3	Note the "Build your army" button on the front: TLG obviously is encouraging customers to buy multiples, and with good reason, which will be explained later in this review.

3	An overview of the set's content: You can see a droid carrying vehicle, a STAP, and some battle/ super battle droids.

3	A look at the carrier: A light tank.

3	Note the guns on the front: The guns and cockpit can turn a little bit left and right from the main body.

3	Also, the guns can move up and down, free from the cockpit: And check out the cockpit: Two 2x1 center studded plates side by side for the pilot to stand on.

3	Now, moving on to the STAP: A small, very useful vehicle in the SW universe.

3	These are seen frequently in both the movies and games (as well as other multimedia).

3	The design is very clever, using vertical building and a clear stand.

3	Rear view: The guns/ handlebars can go this far back: And finally, the figs: The figs are very good, but very common.

3	We havent seen SBDs in a while, and now instead of metallic blue, they are metallic dark grey.

3	The worst part of this set is that the battle droids have the old arms and guns, while the droids in the MTT and clone pack (both of the same year as this) have the new ones.

3	I wonder why TLG decided to do that... again, This set originally came with four megaphone blasters for each battle droid, but I replaced them (along with the crooked arms) with the new blaster pistols and new twisted arms.

3	So thats about it, heres the...

3	FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, very easy, should take the seasoned builder about 5-10 minutes.

3	Playability: 6/10, has a few play feature, but nothing exciting.

3	Is good for MOCs and army building.

3	Swooshability: 8/10, I suppose you could fly around the STAP... Minifigs: 7/10, the battle droids are good, but very common, and the dont come with new arms or guns.

3	The SBDs are very nice, and in a new color.

3	All figs are great for army building.

3	Design: 8/10, the STAP was clever, but the carrier was a little bulky.

3	Price: 10/10, as fair as it gets.

3	Overall: 7.5/10, the figs are great to have and make MOCs and armies, and the vehicles are pretty cool (the carrier is a little lame).

3	The main problem with this set is that the BDs dont get the new guns or arms, so they dont fit in with all the new sets.

3	Also, droids arent as cool as clones.

3	But the price is very fair.

3	And now, my review has ended.

3	Unfortunately, I believe this will be my last review for a long time for two reasons: one, the remaining sets that arent done (according to KimT's index) I either don't have or are broken or have missing pieces.

3	and two, my budget is low right now, and I wont be able to get the Clone Wars sets right when they are released, so someone will probably beat me to reviewing them.

3	Too bad, because I would love to do an RGS review... well, as always, comments very welcome!
