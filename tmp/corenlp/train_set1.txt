2	306 Lunar Landing Plates Year Released: 1979 Piece Count: 2 Minifigs: 0 List Price: unknown As part of the Classic Space Collection, Lego offered two sets of moon plates.

2	One was a set of two crater plates, and the other, this very useful Landing Plate set.

2	Not much to review, but worth sharing a few images: The landing plate: And T-Plate: The two plates connect to form this very nice Classic Space landing platform: Set 497, Galaxy Explorer included the landing platform, but the one that I had was lighter in color than the one contained in this set (at least the yellow circle).

2	Future Lego space sets could benefit by having similar road plates.

2	Share your thoughts.

3	These are my only space base plates from Classic Space.

3	Actually, with only 2 plates, I could not do much serious expansion with it.

3	Instead, I merged it with my old city baseplates, and used it as a docking station for scientific purposes or restricted facilities that is guarded by the police.

3	These baseplates are very useful and is suited for creating a space command center, up in the space.  

1	These are pretty good, but I think they look too much like the standard town roads from that period.

1	I like the black space plates from the early 90s better (6710).

3	Awesome!

3	I had not seen these before.

3	They would really make nice plates for a SW Death Star scene.

3	Thanks for sharing.

1	first, what i liked sooooo much was the cover of these plates, with this large picture of a classic space scene.

1	I still have a '306' misb just to keep that nice feeling of taking it out of a plastic box, and look at it... there were different versions of the cover though.

1	second, the markings of the landing platform changed at some point.

1	i'd have to check it later when i'm at home, think it had something to do with the interupted yellow lines...

2	You make a very good point there.

2	I've used these plates to represent restricted areas, and even as simple airport runways, beyond their space uses.

2	I never liked the black plates (they were during my dark ages anyway, so I've never really seen one up close), but I have seen them used in a Death Star display as suggested and it turned out fairly well.

3	These plates are great in setting up your space base and giving your ships a place to land.

3	My favorite, though, is the lunar crater plate, which I use to death in my comic.

1	Why pay $350 Dollars, just download the instructions on buy the pieces off Bricklink.

1	This is was I did when I wanted to create the Blacktron II in the Futuron colour scheme.

1	Also I tend to like both sets of base plates, I bought the black ones myself and they were of great use but there more for creating the idea of a city or space station, something more completely man made.

1	The gray ones give a better look of the roads being laid over bare rock especially when you introduce the plates with the craters.

1	I would love to see a 48*48 baseplate with roads through them which would allow more building space on the side and maybe some craters.

1	Also 48*48 baseplates with craters but a few different kinds to create more or a realistic look and less of a repeating pattern.

1	And with all those rocks you have to put everything up on supports, much better looking bases then.

1	That's the problem; the instructions aren't anywhere to be found, not that I've seen.

1	The set does seem to have some rare parts, but I doubt $350 worth.

3	Oh how I love these plates.

3	Afew years ago I found a local retail store with about 6-7 sets of these in their basement warehouse I was given special access to (along with MANY other old space goodies.. hehe..) I love the things, I have loads, and I've used them for multiple space bases and battles.

3	Along with afew grey crater plates and the large grey plates (1.5x the size of a normal baseplate) you can get quite a monorail layout going.

3	*sigh* I should really clean up and get one set up again, so I can take some pictures!

2	Wow, nice.

2	You probably have enough to make that scene on the box picture.

2	I got one pack off ebay a while ago and have another octagon plate from the Blacktron 6988 base.

2	I'm building my carrier MOC around one but don't have anything planned for the others.

2	These baseplates are still relatively common on ebay for their age.

2	I see MISB packs on there every few weeks and they tend to sell for around $20.

2	The older kind (in the OP) are much harder to come by.

1	By looking at the pictures used to display this set I've a sneaky suspicion it did not come with instructions but meant for the pictures to be ideas.

1	The whole set was suppose to teach children to use their imagination, giving them instructions would somewhat defeat this while trying to figure how to build things from looking at pictures would be a much better educational experience.

2	I also love these plates!

2	I build a lot with them (e.g.

2	this ).

2	Unfortunately they are not available in bley ...

2	But I don't wanna use my imagination!

1	Year Released: 1976 Piece Count: 53 Minifigs: 2 LEGO brought out floating boats quite early, and in many ways the first were the best.

1	(I'll explain why later...) This set in particular is interesting as it came out in two versions; one that includes the first minifigs and another that included the non-armless type.

1	(Set 709.)

1	The police signs are stickers, and are in surprisingly good condition considering the age of the set.

1	(I am missing one sticker on the front though.)

1	Note the Technic Bush and Axel; they are the old type.

1	The position of the second figure is not a mistake; I think he's supposed to be sitting down....

1	The first boats out by LEGO needed a weighted keel to prevent them.... keeling over.

1	(I have tested this!)

1	I suspect this is because of the density of the old hulls and the flat bottom... but I could be wrong.

1	(It can't be just because of the flat bottom as the new cargo ship doesn't need one.)

1	The keel in detail.

1	The bottom extension is for a motor.

1	(Not included, nor made by LEGO at the time.)

1	The keel had longer studs.

1	Even now it holds extra firmly.

1	This is why I prefer the old design.

1	You can extend or shorten the hulls as you please, or even insert other LEGO in the middle.

1	You can easily add wheels or any other piece to the bottom of these hulls.

1	I wish they would go back to this idea; the 4+ hulls were of this concept but were too wide.

1	(Probably so the keel wasn't needed.)

1	The old minifigs aside from having odd feet and no arms had a normal stud as the neck.

1	Thus when you turn the head it tends to come off.

1	I love this set!

3	Great review Sinner.

3	I own the later version, 709 released in 1977.

3	Mine no longer has decals though.

3	The variations were minimal.

3	It looks like your boat is in really good shape considering it's >30 years old.

3	Excellent review!

2	I know; I got it for a song on eBay.

2	Most 1970s sets don't seem to be in much demand...

2	How about "These Policemen are unarmed?"

1	Nice review Sinner!

1	The old sets...

1	I donÂ´t know - every old set, especially equipped with the old non-moveable arms minifigs look very odd nowadays.

1	I agree with you with the hull shape and its possibility to be extended, but every other aspect, the lack of detail, the keel itself (you canÂ´t float it in shallow water) keeps me from rating it higher than 3/10.

1	In my opninion the best police boat so far is 4021 *click to enlarge*

3	I love those minifigs, they'd go for alot on ebay I bet.

3	Great boat as well, I love the old hull design.

3	This set showed what potential variations on the standard brick had back then.

3	I think that TLG was still finding its legs back then and learning new things so this is a solid set for the year it was released.

3	Nice review Sinner.

1	Thank you for the nice review, Sinner.

1	This set just isn't a good example, that's all.

1	OH, and I also agree with you about that police boat.

1	However, the newer one in the CITY line is also great, IMO.

1	The only thing that weighs against it is the giant size, which makes it feel awkward in more classic towns.

1	LOL!

1	I can't help but smile everytime I see the quote on this thread..... don't worry these police are armless!

1	LOL

3	well what to say?

3	i got this boat late 70s, when we were on our way to Italy to spend the holidays there.

3	My parents always needed to keep my quiet during the 3-day trip, and the best way to do that was to buy me a lego set...

3	I got this one in a gas station in Germany.

3	As far as I remember Italy didn't have lego sets, so a gas station close to the Italian border but still in Germany or Austria was very often their last chance.

3	I often saw large quantities of lego sets in those gas stations though... i remember seeing yellow castle and... the galaxy explorer, standing on a shelf.

3	It would be my birthday 1-3 week(s) later so i always made sure they knew what to buy for me...

3	Quote I often saw large quantities of lego sets in those gas stations though... i remember seeing yellow castle and... the galaxy explorer, standing on a shelf.

3	These were the times...

3	Although I donÂ´t recall Lego sets in fuel stations in the past I would appreciate to see Lego "on the go" now.

3	ItÂ´s holiday time and I have two sons, you know.

2	So, you've been bitten by the classic bug too, Sinner.

2	Great review; but one would think arms would come in handy (pun intended) when you are a police officer, right?

2	It's a shame that many of the original figs must now be forced to stand looking like they have their hands in their pockets, eh?

2	I have no idea where I was going with that last sentence...

3	As you may have seen in my topic in general LEGO discussion, I received a bunch of old LEGO from my step-grandmother-in-law.

3	Among the bricks were instructions and pieces for an almost complete set 345 from 1969.

3	I was very excited to find this out, so I put it together.

3	I recently took it apart and re-assembled it, taking photographs along the way for the sake of Eurobricks.

3	So, without further ado, set 345: House With Car.

3	First off is the car.

3	This was still constructed in the bucket of bricks I received, so I never took it apart: Next I'll show you the instructions.

3	Lots of added bricks per step, which was fun.

3	However, the angle of the instructions sometimes made it difficult to find where things were supposed to go.

3	The in-build shots.

3	Finally, an all-around view of the finished set.

3	Sadly, I don't have much time to post more pictures or thoughts.

3	However, I'll try to come back and update the review later this week.

3	Until then, enjoy!

3	Nice review, 'Mariko'!

3	This set is way past my time.

3	The baseplate is okay (though I hate those dots).

3	The car is pretty cool too...

3	Great review.

3	I never had this set, but it looks nice.

3	I really like the checker pattern near the big window.

2	Way before my time, too--in fact, this set came out twenty years before I was born!

2	The baseplate doesn't actually have dots--I'm not sure if they were there once, and then rubbed off (a possibility, as the studs are rather smoother than I imagine they once were), or if this particular one didn't have the dots.

2	This set also shows that the difficulty LEGO has in doing vehicle scale isn't new.

2	The house is the perfect size for microfigures from the LEGO Games; however, the car is massive--over twice as tall as a microfig!

3	Great Review Mariko!

3	This set is way before my time too.

3	I like how LEGO used to create simple one story houses instead of the really tall house that we see in today's Town Theme, such as 8403 City House.

3	One story houses such as 345 just look more realistic to my eyes.

3	The simplistic, minimalism vibe that I get with this set is something that is hard to find in today's much more detailed sets (although, trust me, I love love love today's detailed sets).

3	- The Brick is Epic

3	Image Link from Brickset I thought I would do a pic review of the 1st Lego Castle, The Yellow Castle, #375- released in 1978.

3	First, let me say that this set was truly "ahead of it's time".

3	It introduced new building concepts (such as the hinge and new figs (most were still the armless, faceless mini-figs during this time).

3	This set introduced me to Castle which was my first real favorite theme.

3	I enjoyed breaking it out from the garage and building it again.

3	The majority of the pieces are 1x1, 1x2, 1x3, 1x4, 1x6, and 1x8 standard yellow bricks.

3	The set also includes yellow 1x4, 1x6x2, and 1x8x2 arches, yellow 2x2, 2x3, and 2x4 bricks, various grey plates, 1x2 black inverted slopes, red drawbridge pieces, two classic red castle doors, 8 hinges (2 for each corner), and a few other nifty pieces including six red 1x1 windows.

3	A complete inventory is available at Peeron: 375 Inventory.

3	A view from the front.

3	The drawbridge is 6x8.

3	The front tower stands 12 1/3 bricks high (plenty of room for horses).

3	The drawbridge does work.

3	The string (originally black) is attached to the opposite side between a plate and the arches.

3	The right side of the castle (identical to the left).

3	I've always loved the 2x2x3 sloped bricks (and corner pieces): The back.

3	I love these red doors.

3	A 1x4 brick attached to the other side of the baseplate keeps intruders out.

3	That banner was the original sticker piece.

3	Notice the wear.

3	The rear tower, largest of the towers: And backside: Two hinges at each of the corners allow the corners to open for playability: Before opening: Open: Lots of arches add to the detail of the inner walls: Inner front: This set included 14 figs (how about that for quantity).

3	Unfortunately, I peeled off worn stickers from the shields and the breast plates years ago.

3	The blue castle guards and knights are the keepers of the castle.

3	I still think that these helmets are the best Lego ever made.

3	They just look good.

3	The black and white knights: And the red knights: I've always prefered to use the black and red guards and flags from the knight's joust set(s): Conclusion The Yellow Castle is truly a classic set and I'm so glad I kept the pieces to this together after all these years.

3	If you have a chance to buy one or even obtain the set instructions, it's worth building and wouldn't be difficult to substitute grey or other colors.

3	I hope you enjoyed this review and feel free to share your comments.

3	nice review!

3	i haven't built yellow castle for many years, but i do remember the fun i had building it when i was young... Yellow castle just opened up an entire new world for me... also, i liked all the alternate models on the box :oD wish i still had that...

2	There's two alternates on the back of the instructions and as I recall, some sort of bridge on the inner fold or back of box.

2	I threw away the box to this set years ago- just lucky to still have all the pieces.

2	With standard pieces, you can build all these alternates and many more.

2	That's why I don't particularly care for the new castles (like Vladek's).

2	They make building so difficult and duplicate pieces are so limited.

2	Here's an old shot of the castle in the city that it use to guard.

2	We played for hours back in these days,

3	Great review.

3	It is nice to see an in-depth photo review of this set.

3	I especially love the last picture of your old city!

3	It certainly does bring back memories...

3	Yup that is very very nice..I wish I had been alive back then :D Well ill never have a chance to own something like this so this is as close ill get to it!

3	Thanks for showing me the greatness....

2	Question for you guys, what's the best way to clean Lego?

2	I was noticing that the baseplates and gray plates to this set are very dusty and could use a good cleaning.

2	Mild soap water soak?

2	Is there a better way?

3	Toothbrush and mild soap - and lots of time gently scrubbing a cleaning.

3	And great review - I love that set *wub* *wub* I'm sorry that You seem to miss the stickers - If You find somewhere to download printable copies of them please let me know *satis* KimT

2	They do need to be re-sized.

2	In US, I converted them to .59 inch width.

2	You could do the same in cm by converting to 1.5 cm wide.

2	I ended up with a PowerPoint sheet of multiple shields and torso designs.

2	Printed on sticker pages from a good quality photo-printer gives you very nice stickers.

2	so you're using two layers (stickers) doesn't that make it very thick?

2	Here's a shot of a custom forestman.

2	These really work well: I'm using just regular sticker paper.

2	How do you stick transparent plastic on top?

2	i guess it's easiest to put the entire shield on a transparent sticker and cut the edges.

2	i would also do that with the white stickers, because now you can still see the gray edges of the shield.

2	Perhaps you can make a bigger black, or brown in the other case, outline.

2	you also wouldn't be able to see if the sticker is exactly in the middle...

2	Quote so you're using two layers (stickers) doesn't that make it very thick?

2	Not really.

2	I think it works out very fine.

2	Cut out the image.

2	Wasn't this the first castle Lego released?

3	As stated in the first post, over 2 years ago, yes, it is.

3	This is a wonderful review, The Brickster, and this would truly be a great set to own.

3	Yes, I hear you younger FOLs say this meant we had less variety at the time, but at least we did not have to go on a frenzy to get them all in just 1 or 2 years before they disappeared (to re-appear on the secondary market at crazy prices).

3	Anyway, I also realise this set is older than me by 5 years (at least the first boxes of this set).

3	I think my parents bought it when I was something like 1/2 year old, or even before, as my Father really liked the Hobby Set line and took any chance to get one, you know, for the kids, when theyâ€™ll be old enough to play with themâ€¦ I am really happy my Father did it, too.

3	As a matter of fact, this has always been one of my favourite non-minifigure scale sets.

3	I know younger eyes will look on it and wonder how we could love and enjoy a model like this, so blocky and rough.

3	Just remember this was the best TLG designers could do with the bricks available at the time.

3	Enough about memories; letâ€™s start with the review!

3	The Box Front The front of the box (here cut and folded to save space) shows the Harley Davidson 1000cc in all its glory upon a nice town landscape.

3	I really appreciate how TLG box designers used a real life photo of the model in a real life environment to give this Hobby Set a better background.

3	Moreover, the landscape does not distract the eye, even with its lights, since the focus is strongly set on the motorbike itself.

3	Back (and sides) The back of the box shows the model on a more neutral background and from another angle.

3	We can see the stickers in place (take a good look at them here, because I did not apply them).

3	The right side we also see a pic of the set from the front, and one with a child playing with it.

3	In this latter shot, the model rests upon a nice black box with a Harley Davidson sign on it.

3	I frankly do not remember if this was some sort of tray or smaller box within the LEGO one or if it is meant for publicity only.

3	Another thing we can notice on the right-most side of the box is a white band, right below the LEGO logo, sporting the sign â€˜Designed for experienced LEGO buildersâ€™ in various languages.

3	All in all, a really well done and professional job.

3	Contents Inside This set includes a number of parts in mainly Black, White and Light Grey.

3	Some Blue and Yellow add nice touches of colour to the total.

3	The partsâ€™ selection is not mind-blowing, as most of the pieces had been in production, in these same colours for years.

3	Anyway, Iâ€™d like to focus on a couple of details: The Milky White Technic axles as well as the Red Technic Bush Old 2 are among my favourite parts.

3	The bushes, in particular, are quite useful to build more sturdy looking tubes than what can be achieved with the newer and slimmer ones.

3	It would seem that the tile pieces appeared in the â€˜without groveâ€™ version as a standard and in the â€˜with groveâ€™ version as alternates (see Bricklink inventory).

3	Notice, though that the box (above) and instructionsâ€™ (below) pictures all show the â€˜with groveâ€™ variety.

3	As said, there are no re-coloured parts in this set.

3	New pieces The few new molds used in this set are: Black and White Slope, Inverted 45 2 x 2 Old Type with Round Bottom Tube, Black Technic, Brick 1 x 2 with Hole Type II and Red Hinge Plate 2 x 4 with Articulated Joint â€“ Male and Female.

3	The most interesting piece from this lot, as many of you will have noticed is the Technic, Brick 1 x 2 with Hole Type II.

3	This kind of technic brick was use during 1976 and 1977 only.

3	It would seem TLG tried a new design variant, which did not meet success and was later replaced with the standard bricks again.

3	Nonetheless, Iâ€™m sure that people who own these bricks like them for the unusual design and the possibilities they offer into adding details to their creations.

3	Instructions Cover â€“ As usual, the instructions are not organised in the form of a booklet, but they consist of a folded double printed sheet.

3	The â€˜coverâ€™ shows again the same shot as the front of the box, with bigger LEGO logo and set number and without the other additional information.

3	â€˜Back coverâ€™ â€“ Here we see the full name of the set: Harley-Davidson FLH 1200.

3	This makes me wonder: why is this set known as 394 Harley Davidson 1000cc when it is indeed a 1200cc?

3	Anyway, what really makes me love this page is the list of stats below the photo, and in particular these two lines: H.P.

3	(?

3	)/(not given).

3	This calls for just one question: why did Harley-Davidson not release this info?

3	My opinion is that since this is a motorbike built for the Police, they did not have permission to share the specifications on the motor, which was probably customised either by Harley-Davidson upon request or by the Police themselves.

3	â€˜Random pageâ€™ â€“ As expected, no call-outs here, but the build is pretty straight forward and does not need them (apart for one passage weâ€™ll see later).

3	The colours are easy to tell apart (in the end there is no Dark Grey in this set that could be confused with Black).

3	Again, notice how the instructions include the â€˜with groveâ€™ tiles and not the older ones.

3	Maybe this was changed during the long time this set stayed in production?

3	The â€˜last pageâ€™ shows other four models included in the Hobby Set line.

3	Unfortunately, I own only one of them: the 396 Thatcher Perkins Locomotive.

3	Indeed, I would have liked to have them all!

3	Building Start The handle bars look a bit too squared to me, but itâ€™s just a minor feature, and the overall shape is still good in my opinion.

3	Notice the red hinge plate, which will be almost totally hidden in the finished model (see below), and the blue tiles which work as indicators.

3	The first steps, used to build the front wheel and windshield are really easy, until you get to the wheel.

3	In facts, the instructions do not show clearly all the pieces needed for it, and I found myself with a â€˜floatingâ€™ wheel for the absence of one of the Red Technic Bush Old 2 on one side (the one not visible on the instructions, of course).

3	Not a big deal, but something that could have been done better.

3	Motor and seat The second part of the build includes the motor, seat and â€˜saddle bagsâ€™.

3	The technique used for the motor, or better the radiator, is very clever.

3	To get the ridged feel, TLG designers used 4 Light Grey plates stuck one on the other but not completely in contact.

3	This way, the studs, while keeping the plates in position, keep them raised from one another at the same time.

3	The Yellow round bricks add some details and colour touches to this predominantly Light Grey parts of the vehicle.

3	The use of the Engine, Smooth Small, 1 x 2 Side Plates for the exhaust pipes, while quite clever, still looks a bit strange to me.

3	Iâ€™m mostly used to see them in airplanes, helicopters and spaceships.

3	â€˜Saddle-bagsâ€™, a simple build for one of the iconic parts of this motorcycle.

3	Here you see them in place, as well as get a look at the finished seat.

3	I like how LEGO designers managed to make its shape with just a few quite big bricks.

3	The â€˜saddle bagsâ€™ are a really nice touch, and they work perfectly when compared to the original.

3	This is the rear wheel.

3	As said before, only when you get to this passage in the instruction you get a real understanding of how the front wheel is supposed to be mounted as well.

3	Careful readers will notice how this is not one of the original wheels in this set.

3	The original ones were mounted using the Technic, Gear Expert Builder 9 Tooth.

3	Unfortunately, I could only find one of them in my collection, an itâ€™s used as the front wheel.

3	By adding the rear wheel (which is shown from a better angle in the instructions), we complete the model.

3	Notice how the two technic bricks supporting the wheel are held in position by two 2x1 plates.

3	I think this was a bad case of â€˜building by compartmentsâ€™ mentality: if TLG designers had considered this a bit more, they would have used 2 4x1 plates instead of 4 2x1.

3	On the other hand, this is not the worst case I have seen in a LEGO set, and they keep up the tradition nowadays too.

3	Finished set Front And here it is our fancy Police Harley-Davidson!

3	Indeed, the front looks blocky and quite horrible to our eyes, but again, it was almost the best that could be done at the time.

3	I only wish they had made it a little less bulky, even though this build is clearly thought to give better stability to the wheel.

3	The Blue tiles work nicely to emphasise the indicators, the slightly unsightly red plate is normally covered by the plate sticker and the windshield, albeit being hard to see through, is nicely shaped.

3	Back The back side is less detailed than the front, but shows the red light and antenna which are typical of the Police motorbikes from this period.

3	How many times have we seen this angle in the chase scenes from TV shows like â€œCHiPsâ€?

3	Side All in all, this model looks pretty sturdy (apart for the antenna, which falls off all too easily) and detailed, especially considering the limited variety of parts available and used at the time.

3	They even got so far to put a 2x2 tile as kick-stand to display it without fear of it falling on the sides!

3	Bonus images Size comparison?

3	What I never understood about this set is what scale it is meant to be.

3	I mean, it is clearly not minifig-scale, and it could not be technic-fig-scale (those came later).

3	But it is not even Miniland scale!

3	Moreover, the only other model with the same scale is the other Hobby Set motorbike, as the cars have a scale of their own and the Thatcher uses still another one!

3	Final comments Overall, this is a great set for collectors of old models and motorbike fans, or both.

3	It does not sport a huge variety of bricks, but was a good choice at the time, and even if the result is matter-of-fact blocky when compared to the original, it implements some good solutions to minimise the LEGO brick appearance and maximise the similarity as much as possible.

3	Design & Colour scheme â€“ 9/10 (The design is as accurate as possible, apart for the front mudguard maybe, and the colours are completely in line for a Police vehicle.

3	The solutions and details included in this set justify the â€˜Expert buildersâ€™ label and add to the appearance, and, why not, playability of the model.)

3	Parts - 8/10 (Not a huge selection, and very few new molds.

3	Nonetheless, a good source of Black and White standard parts for MOCs and one of the few sources for the extra rare Technic, Brick 1 x 2 with Hole Type II pieces.)

3	Playability - 9/10 (A sturdy model which can take some serious play and swoosh-ing without falling apart.

3	The easily detachable antenna and the lack of an appropriate scale interaction with most other models make it lose one point, though.)

3	Build - 7/10 (Pretty straight forward, with few nice solutions and an already mentioned slightly obscure passage in the instructions.)

3	Price - 5/10 (Like most older models, especially the Hobby Set and Model Team ones, this set can be found at reasonable prices only rarely.

3	Most of the times, people are asked shameful prices for such a smallish set.)

3	Overall: 8/10 Very good.

3	As always, questions, comments, and pic requests welcome!

3	Great job on this review of a unique and rare set LuxorV!

3	Considering the year it was released, this must have been a cool set back then.

3	Even up to now with all the specialized pieces and advanced building techniques, I could still appreciate the beauty of this brickbuilt Harley-Davidson police motorbike.

3	The various elements are instantly recognizable and it even has the unusual 'partly-stacked' plates technique for the motor.

3	Overall, I'd say this is an above average set that is a must-have for any hardcore LEGO collector.

3	Great review!

3	The set is really nice, I love that the front of the motercycle can turn and the engine is just beautiful, with its half stacked bricks like KielDaMan said.

3	The price used or new is quite a bit, but there is a good variety of bricks here like the bricks inside the wheels.

3	Did you get this set from your father?

3	Great review LuxorV!

3	LuxorV this is an awesome review.

3	The classic-ness of this set is just lovely.

3	It's so easy to just fall in love with this set.

3	You're review is outstanding as well, the pictures are so clear and the review is just solid.

3	You've really polished your reviewing skills

3	Wow, talk about illegal connections, eh?

3	Great review.

3	I really like this set, even for its age

3	Thanks for the feedback guys!

3	Indeed this is a great set, and I'm very attached to it.

3	As far as I remember, I got it for say my 2nd birthday, I think But it is not my first LEGO set.

3	You'll learn more on this in my next planned review

3	LuxorV, this is a well written presentation on this LEGO Vintage review.

3	I never knew the existence of this set and even though the design is not part of the modern LEGO design concept but the overall appeal back in the 1970s certainly appeal to many.

3	I could not mind to own such vintage LEGO model and put them on display and potray as if it was a chart of evolution of LEGO motorbikes.

3	Thanks for sharing and I can't wait to find out your next review.

3	Thanks 'LuxorV' for this review of such a classic old Lego set and I do remember seeing these in a catalogue years ago.

3	Excellent brick-built police cycle, I think it's time Lego did another one eh ?

3	Brick On Ride On Everyone !

3	Great review for a classic model.

3	I love it.

3	Theme: Hobby Sets Set name: Thatcher Perkins Locomotive Set Number: 396 Price (new): 369-450 $, 258-314 Euro Price (used): 100-355 $, 45-250 Euro Pieces: 434 Year of release: 1976 Links: Peeron, Bricklink and Brickset My Father assures me this is the very first LEGO set I ever got.

3	In facts, he gave it to me as a present for my first half year.

3	Of course, that is to say he bought it for himself and used me as the official excuse!

3	When I grew up, at first I found it to be quite boring: no minifigures, limited play features; in the end, it was just a locomotive!

3	It soon went to forgotten-land.

3	Then, when I was about 10 years old, I one day found again the instructionsâ€™ â€˜bookletâ€™ and saw this bright coloured big steam engine, and I suddenly wanted to build it again.

3	It would seem I finally got to the right age (at least for me) to appreciate the design of this great set.

3	But enough about memories; letâ€™s start with the review!

3	The Box Front The front of the box (here cut and folded to save space) shows the Thatcher Perkins Locomotive in all its glory upon a nice countryside landscape.

3	I really appreciate how TLG box designers used a real life environment made of sand, gravel and pebbles to give this Hobby Set a better background.

3	Moreover, the landscape does not distract the eye, since the focus is strongly set on the locomotive itself.

3	The box measures about 39.5 x 24.5 x 5.5 centimetres, or 15.56 x 9.65 x 2.17 inches.

3	This is more or less the size of the 4840 - The Burrow, or the Advent Calendars.

3	Back (and sides) The back of the box shows the model on a more neutral background and from another angle.

3	We can see the stickers in place (take a good look at them here, because I did not apply them).

3	The right side we also see a pic of the set from the (3/4) back, and one with a child playing with it.

3	In this latter shot, the model rests upon a nice black box with a Thatcher Perkins sign on it.

3	Unlike the Harley Davidson 1000cc set, the Thatcher Perkins does not have the sign â€˜Designed for experienced LEGO buildersâ€™ for some reason.

3	Contents Inside This set includes a large number of parts, mainly Black, Blue and Red, with some nice Yellow to lighten it up more.

3	Parts of interest The partsâ€™ selection is not exceptional, but weâ€™ll see this set includes some unique pieces which have not been in LEGO sets for long years since the 1980s, like the very nice Black Plate, Modified 1 x 2 with Steam Engine Cylinder, Flat Surfaces, Black Train Wheel Spoked for Motor and the Red Train Steam Drive Rod Holder - Train Steam Drive Rod group.

3	The Wheel Spoked Large, as beautiful as they were, saw the light from the production line for the last time in 1976!

3	The only new mold used in this set is the Black and Blue Slope, Inverted 45 2 x 2 Old Type with Round Bottom Tube.

3	As you can see in the above picture, this locomotive was designed to work (well, be played with) on all kind of surfaces, so the wheels sport tyres.

3	In this picture you can see how they look without the tyres.

3	Of course, builders can use the Thatcher Perkins on their brick-built tracks.

3	Another group of interesting parts are shown in this pic: Red Wheel Spoked 2 x 2 with Stud (and tyre), Black Brick, Modified 2 x 4 with Wheels Holder Old, Clear Bottom and Yellow Minifig, Head (Plain) - Stud Solid.

3	Many newer fans will not be familiar with the last two parts: they were standard fare in a number of sets between the 1960s and early 1990s, but then (unfortunately) they were taken out of production.

3	To be fair, the replacement of the Black Brick, Modified 2 x 4 with Wheels Holder Old, Clear Bottom with the standard technic parts was probably due to the fact that the metal pin used to connect the wheels to these bricks had a shameful tendency at getting off the wheel.

3	Too bad it could not be fixed and these parts kept in production.

3	For those interested, here is a picture of the DSS, courtesy of Peeron.

3	Instructions Cover â€“ As usual, the instructions are not organised in the form of a booklet, but they consist of a folded double printed sheet.

3	The â€˜coverâ€™ shows again the same shot as the front of the box.

3	â€˜Back coverâ€™ â€“ Here we see the name of the set and some additional information, like the year when the first Thatcher Perkins started working (1863) and the type (4-6-0) of this locomotive, which, as shown in the image, is related to the number and position of the wheels.

3	On a side note, the pencil signs on the sides of the sheet were made by my Father while counting the parts in the set.

3	â€˜Random pageâ€™ â€“ As expected, no call-outs here, but the build is pretty straight forward and does not need them.

3	The colours are easy to tell apart.

3	Full page â€“ As you may have noticed, all the building steps are drawn on one side of the â€˜bookletâ€™, making it more properly an instructionsâ€™ sheet.

3	What really makes this â€˜instruction bookletâ€™ stand out in my eyes is the fact that it is indeed a poster: the building steps are all on one side, while the other is a bigger image of the completed set with the name Thatcher Perkins in yellow enclosed in an old styled red tag.

3	Building Start The build starts with the base of the locomotive, putting the 10 wheels in place and strengthening the engine.

3	Notice the use of this â€˜illegalâ€™ technique to build the bumpers.

3	LEGO, as we all know can be a tricky medium to build with, and some details need special solutions to be completed.

3	We then start building the boiler and cabin.

3	Going up fast and steady!

3	In the penultimate step, we build the chimney and cow catcher.

3	Iâ€™d like to spend a few more words on the chimney and how it is attached to the main body.

3	As you can see in the left picture, the 3x3 base of the chimney is asymmetrical, with a 3x2 base on one side and a combination of a 1x2 and a 1x1 plates on the other.

3	In the right picture, you see the top of the main body where the chimney will be attached; it is made of a 1x2 base and 1 1x2 tile.

3	Using another â€˜illegalâ€™ technique (or at least one LEGO designers do not like much nowadays), the holes of the 3x2 plate of the chimney will connect with the studs of the 1x2 plate on the main body, giving a well centred and quite sturdy build.

3	Finished set Front The front of the model sports 3 big headlights, a nice cow catcher and the nicely detailed engine front.

3	I can almost hear it whistle!

3	Side And here it is our good old Thatcher Perkins Locomotive!

3	Indeed, it looks like a classic and powerful engine form one of those Spaghetti Western films, doesnâ€™t it?

3	What I found strange in the beginning is the choice of colours (I was convinced steam engines were all black, at the time).

3	Then I checked some pictures of the original, and I must admit the resemblance is almost perfect!

3	Back The back side is less detailed than the front, with cabin almost devoid of details.

3	I think LEGO could have done a better job on it.

3	3/4 Front and â€¦ Just see how good it looks from this angle, with all the tubing, moving parts and the lovely 3 headlights!

3	â€¦ 3/4 Back The back view is not as impressive, but grants us a good look at the big posterior wheels and the bumpers.

3	Bonus images Size comparison?

3	As I stated elsewhere, I never understood what scale these Hobby Sets are meant to be.

3	They are clearly not minifig-scale, and they are not technic-fig-scale either.

3	But they are not even Miniland scale!

3	Moreover, they use different scales between locomotives, cars and motorbikes amongst the Hobby Set line!

3	As I said before, the set comes with tyres on the wheels to allow a wider playing experience, not limiting this model to tracks.

3	Nonetheless, builders can assemble their own track (maybe using the vintage blue 4.5V tracks) and make the Thatcher Perkins run its proper environment.

3	Final comments Overall, this is a great set for collectors of old models and steam engines fans, or both.

3	It does not sport a huge variety of bricks, but was a good choice at the time, and even if the result is matter-of-fact a bit blocky when compared to the original, it implements some good solutions to minimise the LEGO brick appearance and maximise the similarity as much as possible.

3	Design & Colour scheme â€“ 8/10 (The design is as accurate as possible, and the colours are completely in line for the Thatcher Perkins Locomotive.

3	The solutions and details included in this set justify the â€˜Expert buildersâ€™ label and add to the appearance, and, why not, playability of the model.

3	Though, I still wish TLG had included more details in the cabin.)

3	Parts - 10/10 (Quite a big selection, but only one new mould.

3	Nonetheless, a good source of Black, Blue and Red standard parts for MOCs and one of the few sources for the extra rare Black Plate, Modified 1 x 2 with Steam Engine Cylinder, Flat Surfaces, Black Train Wheel Spoked for Motor, Red Train Steam Drive Rod Holder - Train Steam Drive Rod group and Wheel Spoked Large.)

3	Playability - 9/10 (A sturdy model which can take some serious play and swoosh-ing without falling apart.

3	The somewhat easily detachable chimney and the lack of an appropriate scale interaction with most other models make it lose one point, though.)

3	Build - 7/10 (Pretty straight forward, with few nice solutions.)

3	Price - 5/10 (Like most older models, especially the Hobby Set and Model Team ones, this set can only rarely be found at reasonable prices.

3	Most of the times, people are asked shameful prices for such a smallish set.)

3	Overall: 8/10 Very good.

3	More pictures can be found in this Brickshelf gallery.

3	Rare classic sets are always a priceless part of any LEGO collection, and it's a good thing you still have this first set of yours Luxor (or did you purchase a new one?).

3	Excellent review BTW, it's always a pleasure getting a closer look at these classic sets which I wouldn't have known to exist had I not seen this review.

3	Overall I think it's a really good set at that time, of course judging this one by modern standards won't be fair but at the time I'm pretty sure it was a 'cool' set to have (though less cooler than having the Harley Davidson set).

3	Thanks for the review 'LuxorV', an interesting old set, though I find it hard to imagine a square smoke stack instead of roundish.

3	It truly has that classic Lego simplistic build with all studs showing and making do with standard partsm except the few you havepointed out 'LuxorV'.

3	A nice flashback 35 years ago....now thats old school anyway Brick On everyone !

3	Thanks, Luxor, for bringing us this excellent tour round an old classic!

3	For its time, this is truly a remarkably detailed and beautiful set, and I think it's amazing how it's still in such good condition after all this time.

3	Do you have any more from this era (excepting the Harley, of course )?

3	I've created a whole new index to put them in

3	INDEXED 410 â€“ Payloader Theme: Legoland/Vehicle Piece Count: 28 Year Released: 1973 MSRP: ???

3	Links: Brickset, Lugnet, Peeron, Bricklink *Note: This set was released under the number 604 outside of the U.S.* Ah, classic Legoland.

3	A time before mini-figs ever existed, and cars and buildings could be made with just a few bricks.

3	The part selection was pretty basic: bricks, plates, slopes, windows and wheels were all you needed to construct an entire town.

3	Heavy machinery could be modeled in 4-wide and be just a few bricks tall.

3	For this review we will be taking a look at the 410 Payloader, one of LEGOâ€™s first sets of a bucket loader.

3	So grab a hard hat, we are heading to the construction yard!

3	Box image courtesy of Bricklink.

3	Box Contents Here we have our instructions which are obviously the older style of LEGO instructions.

3	The steps used much simpler imagery, but they get the job done.

3	They show how to build the Payloader in seven steps.

3	This small set has all of 28 parts in it.

3	The more interesting parts of note are the red digger arm, the bucket, the blue 1X2 brick with arm holes, and the blue 2X2 brick with the classic LEGO logo printed on it.

3	Construction In the first few steps we start building up the base.

3	Then add the arms and start building the cab.

3	Add the bucket, the trailer socket and finish the cab.

3	Throw on some wheels.

3	Completed Set And with that we are finished with our nice small model.

3	Here is the back right side.

3	Notice how the back of the cab was left with an empty spot.

3	Here is the left side.

3	Notice how on the top of the arm they made it so you could just push down on the tips it to make the arm lift instead of having to grab by the arm itself.

3	On the front we have the nice LEGO logo shown to remind the forgetful of what they were playing with.

3	You can also see how much space is in the bucket itself, which can't hold more than a few small plates.

3	Finally on the back we have the trailer socket.

3	This was a nice addition to make it able to tow trailers from other sets like 685.

3	Just donâ€™t try to bring it into your layout populated by mini-figs, they may have a problem trying to get in.

3	Other Thoughts Considering this set is nearly 37 years old, I myself am still surprised by how well the bricks have held up.

3	I purchased this set from a thrift store a year ago for a mere 25 cents.

3	Normally when used LEGO is purchased you can expect to see scratches, marks, wearing, discoloration, etc but boy was I surprised to see how all these parts are in mint condition.

3	Even the instructions still looked like they came from a new box and not all ripped up and tattered.

3	The pieces still connect to each other nice and tight and the metal pieces for the wheels haven't rusted.

3	This just shows that with proper care these things can last a lifetime.

3	I really would like to get a small display case to show it off.

3	Conclusion Playability: 8/10 In addition to the standard of having rolling wheels, you also get a fully movable bucket assembly.

3	With it you can pick up smaller pieces and unload them into a dump truck.

3	Design: 7/10 Like all other Legoland vehicles it has a very basic design, but you can still easily identify what it is.

3	Simple yet effective.

3	Parts: 7/10 Like most other older LEGO sets, all you really get are a few basic bricks and plates.

3	However, you do get a bucket assembly and the 2X2 brick with the classic LEGO logo on it is very cool.

3	It was also nice of LEGO to include the trailer socket so you could tow around your trailers.

3	Price: 8/10 Bricklink's history shows them to sell for around $10 USD used.

3	While that is a bit much for a set this size, it is pretty good considering this set is over 37 years old.

3	However, if you are looking for a new boxed set be prepared to fork over about $50 USD.

3	Overall: 8/10 This small machine would make a nice addition to your collection as a reminder of LEGO's past.

3	So what are your thoughts on this classic set?

3	Edited by TheBrickster, 01 June 2010 - 05:55 AM.

3	Thank you very much for this wonderful review!

3	This is the oldest Lego set in my collection.

3	I received this model from my grand parents many years ago - I'm not exactly sure who in my family it used to belong to, but it has a home with me now.

3	It's a very simple but attractive looking vehicle, and functions pretty well too.

3	Overall, very nice.

3	Thanks for the great nostalgic review!

3	Great pictures, I love the shiny glow of 37 year old bricks!

3	Sets were simpler back then, but not less exciting in their own way.

3	I wasn't even born in 1973, but one of my first sets was the 1982 update of this, 6630 Bucket Loader.

3	Almost 10 years later, but the very same bucket assembly, only the colours have changed.

3	Nice review!

3	Great nostalgic set, like you said, it has nice design-Simple yet effective!

3	I like construction vehicles, so this set has even bigger impact on me!

3	Ah, the good old days........Thanks for the review 'Yoshi648' - CUTE and COOL at the same time.

3	It's interesting to see that the same front end parts had been used from the early 70's up in to the late 90's !

3	Nice again to step back in time and keep on bricking everyone !

3	I voted 'Outstanding.'

3	Regarding this set, I found mine at a consignment store.

3	It was inside of a larger set from the same time period.

2	Woah.

2	25 cents for a mint condition set!

2	That's amazing.

2	Well, it's not exactly a large shuttle, but still a nice set: 442 Space Shuttle Year Released: 1979 Piece Count: 79 Minifigs: 1 Vehicles: 0 List Price: unknown This little classic was my smallest classic space set.

2	Believe it or not, I still have the box: Here's the back: The instructions are pretty tattered and missing a section.

2	I had to download some from the web: But the ship is again intact, missing only one grey 1x3 plate: I've always liked this computer piece: Here's the under side.

2	This set included the small classic jet engines: A close-up of the sloped printed space brick: And the complete set with minifig: This set was a great little space ship that made a nice addition to the Blue Space Theme.

2	As small as it was, it could hold two-three figs (one standing up).

2	I don't even think the Mars Mission Recon Drop Ship holds three figs.

2	In any case, it was a must-have for Blue Space Fans, and probably only a few bucks back in the day.

2	SWOOSH!

3	It's simply amazing how far Lego has come in 30 years.

3	and again those tears in my eyes.

3	with original box...!

3	I really love those classic space stuff.

3	Looks like I need to clean my stuff this summer.

3	This classic space shuttle is simply superb!

3	I love the layout of this shuttle.

3	In fact, it reminded me as one of the space fighter jet, that roam around in space, defending the boundaries from intruders.

3	I just love these old grey bricks very much and the printed computer brick is just lovely.

3	It's such a pity, that I did not grow up with Classic Space in my childhood.

3	These are actually great stuff, and formed the base of the Space theme in LEGO.

3	Brickster, thanks again for another outstanding classic review.

3	this was my first space set ever!!

3	1979, 1980... don't know anymore, but i do remember i got this together with 897 for my birthday when we where camping... with a little luck i may even have an old film from my dad, opening the boxes... well what to say... it looked soooooo aggressive with those two engines!

3	but i never knew why you needed two steering wheels on it... they probably just thought a symmetrical model was better .... i can't blame them... what a nice set.... it would even sell today, no doubt... looooots of swooshability...

3	The computer is my favorite part.

3	Sadly, I dont own any classic space...Exept for some space police, and a blue classic space man.

3	Nice!!!

3	442 is the lowest set number I have seen for any Classic Space set, so it must been released with the first wave in 1978.

3	Its remarkable that a LEGO spaceship this old and small can seat more figs than the much bigger MX-71 Recon Dropship of today.

3	Anyway, I just want to grab it out of the screen and swoosh it all over the place, lol.

3	TLG, please make these Classic Space sets again!

3	I promise I'll buy many!

2	INDEXED Everyone remembers their first time.

2	For me, it was in 19*cough*somethingsomething*cough*.

2	We were at her house, and her mother was gone for at least an hour.

2	She slowly unzi... uhhh.

2	Sorry, wrong story.

2	Um, yeahh.

2	Anyway, I do remember my first time.

2	It was 1977, in late summer.

2	Our neighbor, who worked for a department store called Famous-Bahr, said that the main store had a travelling LEGO display.

2	So my family filed into the car and drove into downtown St Louis to see this display.

2	To tell you the truth, I don't remember much about the display itself, but I DO remember that my parents bought me my first LEGO set.

2	Set # 456, the Spirit of St Louis.

2	Set #: 456 (also sold as Set # 661) Name: Spirit of St Louis Theme: LEGOLAND / Large Vehicle Year: 1977 Pieces: 49 Minifigs: 0 Price: $5.00 USD?

2	(Bricklink MISB start @ $175.00 USD, Used Complete ~$35.00 USD) Links: Peeron, Bricklink, Brickset Packaging Box Front: The original box that my set came in was most likely trashed 5 minutes after returning home.

2	This image was lovingly stolen off of the Peeron page for this set.

2	I feel lucky that I even got this much.

2	Similarly, I have no pictures of the plastic baggies the set came in.

2	Truth be told, I can't be sure that there even WERE plastic baggies that the parts came in.

2	THE SET Side View: Well there she is.

2	My first set ever .

2	Actually, I seem to recall the real Spirit of St Louis was silver colored, not Black and Yellow.

2	If you need a history lesson, the Spirit of St Louis was Charles Lindbergh's plane when he made the first trans-Atlantic solo flight.

2	More details can be found on the Wikipedia page.

2	The overall shape is pretty close, at least.

2	The cockpit window could stand to be moved forward one stud, but everything seems to be relatively close.

2	The tail piece isn't the right shape, but it is likely the only tail piece LEGO produced at the time.

2	If you look closely, you can see the various bite marks that my brother and I inflicted over the years.

2	I know some people would be aghast that there are bite marks, but brick separators wouldn't come out for another 10 years.

2	Besides, we were young.

2	We didn't know any better.

2	I certainly had no idea that it would become my obsession.

2	There are some interesting part choices here.

2	Everything is brick and plate built, as you might expect.

2	The same set nowadays would have lots of slope, wedges and wedge plates to round things out.

2	But LEGO was all about the brick in '77, so bricks are what we got.

2	The black inverted slopes worked pretty well asthetically as the wing struts.

2	The wings are simple 4 x 10 plates, nice and square.

2	There were no minifigs in this set.

2	If I remember correctly, 1977 was just about the time when minifigs made their first appearance.

2	I know I have one other set from '77 that does include a minifg, at least.

2	I don't have a lot of comments for the following photos.

2	I'll let the pictures speak for themselves.

2	3/4 View Back Back 3/4 Top Front PARTS Interesting Pieces I have no idea if there were any extra pieces that came with this set.

2	I kind of doubt it.

2	Instead I took a photo of some of the interesting parts to the model.

2	That translucent white piece didn't photograph so well, but it is a Technic Axle 8.

2	That's right, sets from 1977 contained Technic elements.

2	The two black parts are the forerunners to the 1 x 2 Technic Brick, as well.

2	Everytime I hear someone on the forums complain about Technic elements in system sets, I think back to this set.

2	The round brick is special as well.

2	Here is a closer view of it, complete with bite marks .

2	Round Brick As you can see, the stud is closed.

2	It is only one of two closed stud 1 x 1 Round Bricks that I own.

2	They stopped appearing in sets in 1981, for those that are interested.

2	The DSS You thought you were going to escape this heading, didn't you?

2	Surprise!

2	Yes, even in 1977 LEGO sets had stickers.

2	The oldest printed elements I can remember were in the Classic Space sets that started in 1979.

2	Again, when people in the forums complain about DSS in sets, I can only help think of this set.

2	And chuckle to myself maniacally.

2	The sticker has held up really well considering it's been stuck on the brick for 32 years.

2	No discoloration, very little curling.

2	I think if all stickers held up this well over time, there would be less DSS complaints.

2	THE RATINGS Playability: 6/10 - The set is quite swooshable, and the propellor spins.

2	Outside of that, though... Minifigs: N/A Design: 6/10 - The overall shape is quite good, especially given the era.

2	The color choice leaves a lot to be desired.

2	Price: 1/10 - It's been retired for 30 years.

2	It's going to cost you to get your hands on it.

2	Overall: 13/30 - This set is for true collectors only.

2	I can't imagine anyone wanting one because they want to play with it.

2	It was a great set back in the day, but the design feels REALLY dated.

2	And if you're wondering, mine is NOT for sale.

2	Ever.

2	All the photos, plus more, can be found in the Gallery.

3	Very brave to give an impression about one of the oldest sets ever reviewed!

3	A lot members here are younger than the set itself.

3	I think you will have to have grown up with it to like it.

3	Nowadays we have seen quite a few better airplanes than that one, for example this years 7643 .

3	But thanks for letting us know.

3	Btw., the 1x1 round brick with the solid stud is no.

3	3062a instead of 3062b (with the hollow stud).

3	Great job!

3	I love reading vintage reviews, as it reminds of our childhood days.

3	Glad to see this in very good condition.

3	By the way, I will move this to LEGO Trains & Town, to see if TheBrickster will like to include this set inside the review index over there.

3	I believe he is maintaining vintage town set reviews over there, and this suits there well.

2	I'm sorry you had to move this topic, White Fang.

2	When it was in the Reviewers Academy, the teachers agreed it belonged in Other Themes.

2	*shrug* I guess it ended up where it belonged eventually.

2	Great review, It's good to see some of the old sets reviewed.

2	I think I learned something about the history of Lego from this one.

2	fantastic review!

2	IÂ´d love to read more like this, trivia about old/rare pieces is almost as fun as the set itself.

3	Outstanding review of a very special set!

3	I actually remember seeing this set on the store shelves of local department stores.

3	Can you believe it?

3	Fantastic review Walter.

3	I really enjoy looking at these vintage sets.

3	This one deserves a BLOG!

1	In 1977, trans or yellow slopes existed already, and using them would have made the plane more realistic.

1	A third rear wheel would have enhanced playability and design, rather than this ugly black round brick.

1	It's the reason why I voted "below average" even considering 1977's standards.

1	However this set is nice and simple, offering good playability.

3	Here is the Spirit of St Louis.

3	Just go there (Washington) and have a look of this legend : Cavannus, on Jul 15 2009, 09:40 PM, said: In 1977, trans or yellow slopes existed already, and using them would have made the plane more realistic.

3	I don't think so.

3	There is no 45Â° slope in the original plane design ... and no front cockpit window.

3	Quote A third rear wheel would have enhanced playability and design, rather than this ugly black round brick.

3	Except that it wouldn't have been the Spirit Of St Louis.

3	This set is a great one and I wish I'd bought it in '77.

3	It is the Spirit of the 70ties ...

1	daoudbazaar, on Jul 15 2009, 05:26 PM, said: [...] There is no 45Â° slope in the original plane design ... and no front cockpit window.

1	[...] Except that it wouldn't have been the Spirit Of St Louis.

1	Oooops, you're completely right, the Spirit Of St-Louis didn't have any front window nor rear wheel.

1	Anyway, I think a standard Ryan M-1/M-2 plane would have been a better choice.

1	Less a legend, but more a flexible plan for multiple uses!

3	I really like the design, it has an aesthetic value lacking from most official Lego planes and follows closely to the real thing (minus the colours), something that can't really be claimed for more recent sets.

3	483 Alpha-1 Rocket Base Year Released: 1979 Piece Count: 170 Minifigs: 3 Vehicles: 1 (two sections) List Price: unknown Despite the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1968, Lego dared design a Rocket Base complete with a rocket system that may have had nuclear capability in 1979.

3	Luckily, the rocket was defective having rather flimsy white bricks that did not stay together well during launch attempts.

3	Lego scrapped its WMD program and the result was this classic "blue era" space set known as the Alpha-1 Rocket Base.

3	Instructions: On the backside of the instructions, the set is featured with the Space Command Center, Space Cruiser, and a few vehicle sets: The set includes three figs: And this great rocket fuel tanker: Here's the front section complete with computer: And the rocket fuel section: The set has some interesting features including the Control Section, Fuel Control, and Launch Pad: On top of the Control Section is a nicely design radar/tracking system: Here's the open control room: The Launch Pad and Fuel Control: The Fuel Control includes two sink pieces and blue steering wheels: And Lego's WMD (Weapon of Mass Destruction), the Alpha-1 on the Launch Pad: Here's a shot of the launching mechanism: Unfortunately, I have lost one of the blue sink/faucet pieces as well as a black hose: A close-up of the Alpha-1 Rocket.

3	The white bricks never stayed together well often times coming apart within your hands: The arming and guidance system was nicely designed: A view of the complete set: And another: This is a great set.

3	The base, fuel vehicle, and launch platform offers a great amount of playability.

3	My only complaint is the rocket (as mentioned above).

3	I don't think I ever played with it a sa kid because it always fell apart.

3	Share your comments regarding this Classic Space set.

2	The white bricks never stayed together well often times coming apart within your hands: Huh, did they not think of putting a technic axle down the center of the rocket?

2	Come to think of it, when were technic axles invented.... Its a neat little set, makes me think I oughta make some similar kinda layout in LDD, very elegant for playability.

2	I always thought that that grey thing on top of the rocket was some kind of satelite... xenologer, on Jul 4 2008, 05:25 AM, said: Huh, did they not think of putting a technic axle down the center of the rocket?

2	Come to think of it, when were technic axles invented....

2	I had this set as a kid and I don't think there was a technic axle inside that rocket, but if I remember correctly some of the later CS rockets did.

3	I'm loving that trans-yellow plate on top of the roof.

3	Great review!

3	wooow!

3	what a set!!

3	not all that large, most defenitely not as sophisticated as the message intercept base from 10 years later, but in those, this was all a kid need to have hours of fun.

3	soooo many great parts on this one.... technic hoses, computers, rocket parts, trans yellow parts... the perfect outpst really... it was actually my sister who got this one, but it only took an hour before i claimed it... Edited by snefroe, 14 July 2008 - 12:36 PM.

3	Oh did I drool over this set as a kid!

3	Since I never got it I didn't know how bad the rocket really was... Great review.

3	xenologer, on Jul 4 2008, 12:25 PM, said: Come to think of it, when were technic axles invented....

3	The white ones were.

3	Ahh, the good old days.

3	Thanks for the review.

3	Nice rewiew The set is good too)

3	Hey EB'ers, i got my Market Street on Monday and finished building it last night.

3	I know it?s not such a nice review like *yoda* did the last times, but i hope you enjoy some of the pics.

3	First a pic of the complete building: The 3 Minifigs: and i pic of the stairs (one of my highlights at this set): More pics you can find here My opinion about the set: I like this set very much, it was really fun to build it.

3	I?m happy that that i got some more cherries and a croissant now *sweet* , a funny idea is the salad in the one box at the front.

3	i think normally it?s a hairpiece of an exoforce fig.

3	I also like the colours of the house, the dark blue is sooooo nice.

3	I think i have to take more of this soon.

3	The lighter blue is also nice.

3	This set has really nice details like the stairs, or the owl at the entry of the market, or the balcony.

3	I paid 89,99 EUR, a fair price for a really nice set!!

3	Greetings Sandra

3	Thanks for the review, my favourite detail is the salad!

3	:-D BTW, could you exchange the modules and make pics of that?

3	I'd like to see how the building looks with the flat roof instead of the dutch style one.

3	I'm not sure though if the vents on the flat roof makes sense as long as it's only used as a garage top... :-/ Maybe they should be removable as the balconies and such things to make the modularity leading not to weird results... Other than this: In combination with a lot of money and the Cafe Corner set this really could get me into city!

3	;-)

1	thanks for the great review!

1	*sweet* now that i've seen the set, I'm afraid i'm a bit disappointed 8-| 1) the color combination doesn't really do it for me.

1	blue, dark blue, grey, black, tan, white, they're all mixed together without any over all design... 2) is there any interior?

1	it doesn't look like it, and in any case, you can only reach it if you remove the modules... hm... |-/ now it looks too much of a box... 3) there are most certainly some nice ideas in this model and some great parts.

1	the best part of the model is the staircase 4) i don't think he spent much time in thinking about the design.

1	As apo said, the chimneys on top of a garage is kinda weird, there's also a gate, next to another gate which is weird as well... also, if this is supposed to ba a grocery, then the owner has done a lot to hide it.

1	The croissant is nice, but next to the brown box with vegies, there's nothing that suggests this is a shop... 5) the white lamp and the the yellow cylinder are at the same level of the tiles.

1	IMO it should be above the level of the tiles... 6), IMO not worth the 90 euro Edited by snefroe1, 20 June 2007 - 09:03 AM.

3	Thanks, I love the look of this set!

3	I love the mix of colours, it breaks up the model rather than being a single monotone colour.

3	He's used several complimentary colours in order to make up the model.

3	I agree I think the chimneys on the flat roof is weird ontop of the garage, but not so weird one you place it ontop of the building.

3	I guess he's done it to give us the choice of roofs and chimneys.

3	You can always remove the ones you don't like...

3	He also seems to have screwed up a bit on the tiling for the sidewalk on the side module.

3	On Cafe Corner (And the building module of this set) the sidewalk has the pattern light grey 1x6 at the front, then dark grey 1x2 next, then dark grey 2x2's.

3	However on this he's put the 2x2 tiles first then the 1x2's at the back.

3	Easilly fixable though.

3	Overall I love this set, thanks for the pics!

3	Compliments Cafe Corner perfectly.

3	Thank you Legocastlegirls for your quick review!

3	*y* It?s the first time I realize the back of the market street.

3	The tan bricks are a replacement for some windows I?d guess?

3	I do love that building, especially the top floor with the neat balcony.

3	*wub* Of course you are (again) left alone filling the interior.

3	But I just had some food parts ordered at Bricklink... X-D One thing I?d like to know: This is an online-exclusive, right?

3	Can I order it at a Lego-store (K?ln / Oberhausen) and get the sum rewarded on my voucher booklet?

3	*sweet* I heard it here, but I?m not sure.

3	8-| If anyone is looking for how to fill it with interior: Go read the latest Brickjournal #8!

3	There?s a whole chapter written about designing the rooms.

3	Interior On!

3	Hi Thanks for posting those great pictures.

3	I got the CC some time ago and I really looking forward to get my hands on the Market Street.

3	I think the colour scheme of this set is great, maybe because blue is my favourite colour (just check my wardrobe)?

3	I really like the design of the roof and the staircase.

3	I ?am not so sure if I like the gateways but I believe they will grow on me when I get the set myself snefroe1, on Jun 20 2007, 09:02 AM, said: 5) the white lamp and the the yellow cylinder are at the same level of the tiles.

3	IMO it should be above the level of the tiles...

3	I?

3	am totally agree with snefreo1, the yellow cylinder and the lamppost should be on a level above the tiles.

3	Actually I have put a 2x2 plat under the lamppost on my CC, looks much better if you ask me.

3	Unfortunately Shop at Home does not send to Norway??

3	?, so I have to purchase this set in Billund (Yes, I ?am going to Legoland this summer) or on ebay.

2	i?ve never seen holes at the footpath for some lamps.

2	It is really dangerous for all the nice little minifigs :-) Greetings Sandra

1	thanks for the pics Legocastlegirl!

1	One thing that I find strange is that TLC doesn't use a female MF head for those two females MF in this set, but a female MF head is available in LDD and pab *wacko*

3	I still haven't bought the CC or MS.

3	But reviews like this make me wanna buy them instantly.

3	Thanks for this Legocastlegirl !

3	!

3	Thank you very much for that nice review and those lovely pictures, Legocastlegirl!

3	*y* A very interesting set with a great color scheme and some "sunny side" feeling indeed.

3	*sweet*

3	I'm not much of a city fan but this looks great.

3	I guess this is the closest we can get to Legoland (miniland) quality sets.

3	And considering this is a three floro, small structure, and it's over 1,000 parts, just imagine (pun not intended) how many peices are in LL California's Empire State Building or WTC Freedom Tower models!

3	Both are large and in real scale over 100 floors!

3	That's a lot of bricks.

3	Anyways, I've got a friend who loves city.

3	I'm sure this one would make a great addition to his town setup!

3	Gotta tell him about this new set!

3	*y*

3	Nonsense Sandra !!

3	Tks for sharing these cool pics ;-) Its also a nice hommage to Erik Brok.

3	I really like this set, I think its really well designed with great ideas such as the dual stairs, the balconies, the croissant insignia, the market entrance design with the horns, whip and owl 8-?

3	I like the color combination, and the mosaic design just in front of the entrance.

3	The only terrible flaw is that yellow cinlinder !!

3	That is just awful for a flower pot :-X I don't mind at all having that lamp post at the same level since it would be normal to have the base of the lamp at the level of the tile but I agree that is just pickering about an insignificant detail :-P Legocastlegirl, on Jun 20 2007, 07:42 AM, said: a funny idea is the salad in the one box at the front.

2	Thanks for the pictures, Sandra!

3	When rich people became poor, they placed bricks in their window, so they paid less taxes.

3	Some older houses still has walls were once were windows.

3	Historic information on :-D :-P

2	It was the same thing in France in the middle-age...

2	Happy that today this taxe is gone!

3	Hi all!

3	I just got my first Gentle Giant SW Maquette and I?m in love *wub* *wub*!

3	On My Shelf On copmike

2	WOOOOOOOOOOOOW!

2	That's some maquette!

2	Say, I wonder if the Blackhole stormie will be playable in LSWTCS?

2	MAQUETTE ON!

3	You?re a lucky man.... *y* Thanks for those cool pics.

3	:'-)

3	You're the coolest man I know!

3	Thanks for sharing copmike.

3	That thing is awesome.

2	Thank you, interesting indeed.

2	Those are quite expensive though, perhaps 60 dollars or more.

3	Very nice *wub* How'd you get a hold of it?

3	Wow, that's awesome!

3	And look, a giant 3x3 lego piece!

3	Here?s the text from the back of the box: Quote For much of the Galactic Civil War, a mysterious agent of Palpatine code-named Blackhole carefully sifted through countless streams of data, distilling it into useful information for Imperial Intelligence.

3	Blackhole had an impressive amount of resourses available to him, including a entire Star Destroyer and its complement of troops and fighters.

3	Per his orders, the stormtroopers under his command had their armor cast in black to match his own particular eccentricities.

3	The armor modification had practical benefits as well.

3	The stygian-triprismatic polymer afforded the stormtroopers increased sensor-stealth.

3	*wub* - pure poetry X-D!

3	Blackhole On copmike

3	Very nice copmike!!

3	I can't wait to get my boba now!

3	Those ebay prices aren't to bad.

3	Hmmmm... :-D

3	Thats so cool!

3	i would want one.

3	It would look good in the house.

3	-ZotS

2	So, were you serious about any of the Boba Fett, Luke Skywalker, Stormtrooper & Darth Vader ones?

2	Because I'd love to see a Boba Fett and Vader one.

2	The Vader & Stormtrooper maquettes are already sold out, have to go Ebay on them in august.

2	Luke is coming out in the 6212 X-Wing bonus pack: And Boba Fett was up for preorder over at Starwars.com shop before it also sold out: Maquettes On copmike

3	Wow, if the tru 6212 is to be believed, the Luke marque costs $50.

3	but that looks so cool.

3	Definitely a keeper.

1	The lightsabers are strangely skinny.

1	Do they light up or something?

1	Or was the transparent plastic too expensive to make thick blades?

1	:-/ :-P

3	Hi, you are right, this is such a fantastic maquette.

3	I really hope that I will get the chance to own the other 4, too.

3	It is carefully packed in styropor.

3	The painting is nice, looks really evil.

3	I think it is a wonderful addition (with the 4 other) to any collector shelf..(-; Mine is number 276. greetings Hendrik

2	I have #70 (and #8 :-$ ).

2	Boba soon On copmike

3	Just had alook on ebay and wow they sure are selling for a pretty darn high price!

3	Great review CopMike, even though it was two years ago.

3	I hope your collection is complete now aswell.

3	Your collection is truely something to behold.

3	Damn you for making me want these now!

3	Seriously, these look amazing and would look great on any bookshelf.

3	Wow thats so cool mutley.

3	My favourites are Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker because the others seem to have funny looking heads.

3	Not so much Boba Fett but the storm trooper and the blackhole stormtrooper do.

3	It must be their helmets.

3	Joke, don't tell it.

3	Because otherwise, burglars would be on their way.... Great review!

3	Maybe one day I get one of these, too.

3	I always wanted one of these (*Sighs*) I don't think that I'll ever get it though.

3	You did it - I´m so glad !

3	I hope it didn´t cost you $1230 which is the cheapest right now for all five on BL !

3	But still cheap compared to this one!!!

3	Well, here are mine: I´ll hang on the my extra Blackhole Stormie a while more !

3	If Morten doesn´t come here and break it that is !

3	Well, now that I have some money, a trip to ToysRUs was obviously in my future, especially since my local TRU has much of the summer 2007 lineup.

3	When I got there, almost all the smaller Castle sets had been sold out, but there was one left: the one I am now reviewing for both Eurobricks and BZPower.

3	;-) The Box: Well, for starters, the Castle theme boxes are beautiful!

3	The blended clear and stormy skies give a great ?clash of the titans?

3	effect, and the action poses help as well.

3	;-) The back is equally nice, featuring a photo showing kids how to use the crossbow, and the brave axe wielder taking a swipe at the skeleton (foolish soldier, that won?t work on skellies!

3	See later on in the review to find out why).

3	And of course, we have a small box with the link to the official Lego website, where TLC can advertise even more Lego sets!

3	:P The Contents: After opening the box, a single bag of pieces (with a couple loose ones), the instruction manual and necessary catalog ( :-P ), and a new wider rubber band holder spilt out.

3	The instruction manual is clear as a bell.

3	No color trouble here, folks!

3	Also, it?s worth mentioning the nice background with the mountain and King?s castle silhouettes.

3	:-) Sorry that there's no picture, but I'll take one if someone wants to see it.

3	;-) The Pieces: For being a 5 dollar set (well, seven in my case.

3	Darn your above average prices, TRU!

3	), Crossbow Attack features a lot of nice pieces (as does the entire Castle lineup).

3	Notable elements include two large brown spoked wheels, two brown modified 1x1?s, a pearl gold slope end, and SIX dark blue modified 1x1x2/3 slopes!

3	The bulk of the pieces, however, are nothing special.

3	I?ll let the picture do the talking for this.

3	The accessories are by far the best parts in this kit.

3	Two different helmets in a beautiful shiny silver are my favorite, but I also really like the scythe (looks good for MOCing) and the round shield ( *wub* ), which are both brand new parts.

3	And can anyone not love the classic axe and crossbows?

3	Oh, and there?s a black lightsaber too, but that?s rather boring compared to the other parts.

3	:-P The Minifigures: Can you say, FOUR figures (including the horse)?!

3	That has to be a record for a regular 5 dollar set, at least in the present age of limited figures per set.

3	We?ll start out with the two Crown militia: a regular soldier and an archer.

3	Both have old faces, but they look spiffy with the shiny helmets and the superb torsos.

3	I?ll name the soldier Bravo the Stout and the archer Angler the Precise, for future references.

3	Now we come to the skellie.

3	Although some people dislike the new skeleton design, I personally prefer it to the old ones, since the arms are now poseable and the face much meaner.

3	The only problem is that the arms hang too low, but it?s not too noticeable when they have weapons in their hands.

3	And last, but not least, here?s the elusive skeleton horse.

3	I for one am very happy that TLC took advantage of that awesome prototype piece and made it into an official mass-production mold.

3	However, the horse is unfortunately one piece, but since regular Lego horses are as well, I don?t have a problem with it.

3	I do have a problem with the pose, however.

3	The legs are in quite an odd position, and I wonder why TLC didn?t make the front and back leg poses symmetrical.

3	Ah well.

3	The Finished Set: I have only two pictures here, since this set is so small.

3	First, here?s the completed crossbow.

3	I must say: FINALLY!

3	No more ridiculous horse mounted catapults or crazy fire wheel launchers!

3	Now we have realistic siege weapons, including the one included with 7090.

3	Plus, it actually launches okay, although not the best.

3	Here?s the other main attraction: the completed skeleton rider and horse.

3	I think it?s rather dramatic with that pose and the dark background, don?t you think?

3	;-) Playability: Okay, so there?s not much in this set, but a bit of imagination brings plenty of possibilities.

3	To show you what you can do, here?s a little story made only with this set.

3	;-) Overall Rating: Presentation: 9/10 Pieces: 8/10 Minifigures: 9/10 Finished model: 8/10 Playability: 8/10 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Final Score: 8.4/10 Crossbow Attack is a fine introduction into Castle, so I recommend it to any Lego fan, whether they are a castle nut or just want a cheap change of pace.

3	TLC has a knack with making great small kits these days, and I more than ever support them in their amazing rebound from their dark ages (between 1997 and 2004).

3	;-) Edited by KimT, 10 August 2008 - 01:33 PM.

1	Thanks for this review, and that great little comic!

1	About the skellies though (X-D), you have to admit that besides their long arms making the skellie legs look out of proportion, that they're just made poorly.

1	They're sticking straight out, as opposed to every other fig, which have a slight bend to make them look more natural.

1	Also, as I'm sure you've noticed, the pegs are on angles!

1	That makes it impossible for them to hold their weapons straight, and they can't even put their arms over their heads without stressing the plastic some...

1	I mean they're DEAD.

1	Well, at least undead, they're not supposed to be stiff, and personally I like the ragdoll look more, it makes them seem more dead :-P

3	A very nice review with good pictures, thanks Grevious.

3	*y* And undead ragdolls on!

3	:-P

3	WOW!

3	That was both an entertaining time, and a learning experience!

3	It was entertaining because the comic made me laugh!

3	It was a learning experience because, well, I dunno.

3	Just wanted to say it.

3	Anyways, great review, Grievous!

3	Edited by trooperdavinfelth, 01 July 2007 - 09:46 PM.

3	Very nice little review.

3	Tis too bad I'm skint and can't afford any sets at the moment.

3	Loved the little story too!

3	Also, on your comment about the skellie horses.

3	All Lego horses are posed like that because it's the way horses walk.

3	Check it next time you can.

3	Thanks for the review.

3	That set is high up on my list; how could it not be with a price like that!

3	(I love the added story.)

3	Excellent photographs!

3	and I like the comic too.

3	I don't care what anyone says, I love the new skeletons.

3	*skull*

3	Nice review, and great little story.

3	:-D *y* Look at the normal horses, their legs are positioned like that too.

3	Only the skellie horse's legs are touching, so as to strengthen the middle, otherwise it could easily snap in half.

3	Also, I think the new skeletons are nice, their head is awesome, I just don't see why TLC couldn't make the bent droid arms with the hand facing vertically, instead of making a new arm design completely straight.

3	Nice review and a great story also grevious, this is a great set and a nice little army builder one at that.

3	The only thing that saddens me about the line itself is the new arms on the skelies, they just look far to big when placed next to a normal fig.

3	For me the old versions of the skelies were far better, why tlc changed to this is beyond me.

3	Still i shall be buying alot of these sets just to increase my army.

3	Tks a lot Grevious for this !!

3	Regarding the set I just love it !!

3	I really oved your comic, it was really well done and hilarious X-D EB Spirit ON !!

2	Thanks for all the comments, guys, and thank you, JoeM16 and iamded for pointing out the reason for the skeleton horse leg positioning.

2	;-) Well, I'll be gone on vacation until the 16, but I may pick up a set or two while down in Tenessee, so if I do, expect a review and another story when I get back!

2	;-)

3	This is the only one of the new castle sets I've been able to get hold of so far.

3	I know others have done it before, but as soon as I'd got it, there was something I just had to try: Heh, cool!

3	*skull*

3	Grim Reaper ON!

3	The new skellie looks so much more natural with the droid arm *y* !

3	Great review, i love this set.

3	Great review *y* Small set with great figs and pieces=must buy The story was hilarious :-) Any chance you are going to review another set?

3	I'm still waiting for a certain member *cough*Hinckley*cough* to review skeleton tower :-D Piranha

2	I'd gladly pay seven dollars for this set.

3	It seems this year that there are no crappy Castle sets.

3	Good review.

2	I've searched high and low accross England to find this...and it's nowhere!

2	I'm too stingy to buy off S@H and so I'll wait my turn.

2	OK, now ot the set: Let's say I buy 3, for ?12.

2	That's 6 soldiers, 3 skellies and 3 horses.

2	Considering each fig is worth ?1 and horses 75p, that means 25p for the catapult!

2	Awesome!

2	There's no Lego Castle anywhere in England!

3	That was a great review!!!

3	very entertaining!

3	:-D love the comics!

3	Here is a review of the new Monster Dino creator set with power functions First lets start with the box which is much larger than it needs to be!!

3	It is one of the new style re-closeable boxes rather than the rip the sides style.

3	This set is typical of creator and comes with three sets of instructions.

3	The Monster Dino a kind of spider and a Crocodile The set comes with two of the new motors one small and one large, a sound module plus the new IR controler and receiver.

3	There is a mix of techniques in this set the core is mainly studless technic, there are some studded technic parts and most of the details are standard creator style.

3	There are two mechanisms one to control the legs and one to control the head and arms.

3	The leg drive is from the large motor and the arm and head are operated from the small motor The completed mechanism will stand on its own without any detail added The detail is added to the base unit to complete the model.

3	The operation of the Dino is very good the design for the motors and drives is very compact and well thought out.

3	The walking motion works well although there is no steering and it will fall over it it encounters obstacles.

3	The sound module is built into the head so when the mouth opens the Dino roars (sort of) Glyman made the comment that this set is ugly as sin and I tend to agree I think there are too many colour variations with different shades of grey, black and that lime green :-P which confuses the look of the finished model but I guess it might apeal more to younger kids.

3	I also do not like the spikes along the back, which glow in the dark, because the are loose and keep falling off.

3	This set is not cheap at ?70 but I guess this is because of the motors and IR controller.

3	While on this I was surprised how good the range was on the new controller it would still operate ever when not in direct line of sight.

3	I would give this set a 10/10 for playabilityit has kept the kid amused for hours I would give it 6/10 for value for money it is a bit pricey Overall 8/10 It took approx 3 hours to build and has been well played with I have posted some more images and some videos of the finished models on my brickshelf page HERE If you have any questions please ask Pete Edited by WhiteFang, 23 May 2009 - 06:28 PM.

3	Indexed

3	Thanks for your review Ickelpete!

3	*y* Nice little movie you made (what?s on tv in the background?)

3	;-) :-D After reading, I wonder more than before what this Dino has to do with Creator?

3	*wacko* The complete mechanism is technic, only the "design"-pieces on top are classic-style.

3	I agree with your comment on the colour-selection.

3	:-X Is that turquise next to lime?

3	Looks like - well, I?m not telling you what I think of right now... ;-) Pretty Lego set, but not for me.

3	I?m waiting for the first pics of the ferris wheel.

3	Or even better, the 8275 Technic-Bulldozer :'-) *wub* New motors On!

3	Thanks very much for that review.

3	I downloaded the instructions last week and I was largely impressed with what was in it.

3	However, like Holodoc, I am waiting for the Bulldozer.

3	I might have to settle with the dino though if Lego charge Australian some absurd price... EDIT: I just watched the videos.

3	Thanks!

3	They are great.

3	The dino is better than I thought... Edited by Sinner, 10 July 2007 - 02:29 AM.

2	Thank you very much for that interesting review, Ickelpete.

2	*y* Well, the color scheme?s pretty bad and the design of that Dino?s a bit to blocky for my liking, but the two alternative models you?ve built?re quiet nice.

2	At least there?re a lot of possibilities coming with that set.... :-)

2	Tks a lot for your review Ickelpete ;-) I saw that set at TRU a couple of weeks ago but was really not interested due to the design - I am not a fan of those motorized Lego sets |-/ I guess the lime colour is to please kids, as well as the general design, far from a real dino ;-) I am sure that its going to sell well to a younger croud.

2	Let me quote you here: Quote The walking motion works well although there is no steering and it will fall over it it encounters obstacles.

2	Hum, I really hope it works welll because I will have to buy that motorized AT-AT and I dont want it to crash :-P *yoda*

3	Ickelpete, on Jul 9 2007, 11:19 PM, said: First lets start with the box which is much larger than it needs to be!!

3	Pete No LEGO box is too big my friend X-D ;-) Nice review *y* As for the set...

3	I don't like the colors myself (surprised?

3	X-D ), and it seems a little blocky.

3	Otherwise, the set is cool.

3	I really like the head.

2	Ugly.

2	As.

2	Hell.

2	But an awesome parts pack, worthy of purchase.

3	:'-) Such a beauty, the functions are great, cool video!

3	I want to get this set so badly... Great review!

3	*y*

3	I bought this set last night and it is great.

3	My biggest surprise was the wheels that were included; I didn't even know they existed and there aren't even that new.

3	Back to the set, he is such a cute dinosaur.

3	:-D Since he is so tubby I think he looks like a baby!

3	I suspect my wife wanted him more than me.... my biggest interest in the set was to have more motors and IR parts so I could make an IR car.

3	Overall, I highly recomend this set, but as others have said, be warned that the box is very oversized.

3	I wish Lego would give up on this whole 1:1 picture thing.

3	*wacko*

1	The box is has really strange dimensions - it's very flat but has a large front - the 1:1 scale.

1	Regarding the spines, because they're made of the softer non-ABS plastic (the stuff the 1994 cutlasses and brown muskets were made of), they lose their shape a bit and so are hard to grip; they simply fall off.

1	I suppose TLC use loads of different colours because a single or two-colour dino isn't very nice to look at, especially when the surface isn't very smooth - it takes your eyes away from the surface and puts it on the colours.

1	Someone should make an all terrain dino that can walk everywhere from this set - I don't have the skill with technic - I always end up layering and never finish any models.

1	:-(

3	Thanks for the nice review.

3	It's butt ugly to me but the motors + IR control seem pretty neat !

3	Even at that high price, it looks like a good parts pack !

3	*sweet*

3	I didn't spot this great review earlier.

3	Thanks for the effort of posting all those pics and videos, they helped me decide that this set is worth getting.

3	Got this baby via shop@home a little early and I though it was time to post my view of this set : (Snefroe you NEED to get this one ;-) ) Sorry for the lack of pics but there are already many pics online of this baby So here it is : Best space set since... a way too long time This is my first new space themed set since more than 20 years and I must say that I’m not disappointed at all.

3	I have much to say about this little gem.

3	First, let’s cut it straight about the Martians minifigures: they are absolutely rubbish.

3	I can’t imagine how Lego could produce such atrocity.

3	This said; let’s move on to the dropship.

3	A real piece of art.

3	Reminiscent of the Aliens movie dropship.

3	The cockpit is spacious and provides a great field of view, too bad there is no hinges to open it, you must remove the canopy completely to switch pilot.

3	The drilling unit can be attached under the ship with the clever use of a rubber piece.

3	It stays well in place once attached, good point.

3	Some people don’t like the inclusion of the 2 containment area for the Martians and crystal on both side of the ship but I kind like it, it makes the ship less empty.

3	The 2 wings are complete with air intake, some armaments and 1 standard launcher on the right wing.

3	Normally I don’t like launchers but this one is very discrete and well integrated.

3	On the tail section are 2 thrusters that can be rotated and provide thus some “realistic” movements to the ship.

3	One of the last highlight of this ship is the landing gears, or I must say landing dishes.

3	6 medium sized radar dishes provide and incredible stability to the set.

3	They are quite sturdy and can take a beating.

3	I’m not going to review the alien spaceship in detail since it’s quite uninteresting.

3	I consider it more like a bonus addition to the set than anything else.

3	The look is passable and there are some interesting building techniques in it.

3	That’s all.

3	To end the review, a little pros/cons table.

3	(We all love pros/cons table :-) ) Pros: - Incredible design - At last a decent space set - Modular functions - Quite Sturdy - Beautiful - Great value for money Cons: - Martians are rubbish - No hinges for the canopy - The drilling unit could use some more details.

3	Score: 9/10 By the way , I added a nice cool feature on my site , you can download the stickers for some sets that I own.

3	Before building I always scan the stickers, we never know it could come handy.

2	*y* Nice review.... hmm, now I?m pretty sure that I?ll have to MOD that cockpit a little when I get that set.

3	Great review, I must admit I didn't like MM at first site, but seeing this review and looking at the MM boxes at stores appeal to me rather greatly, I may get a couple of these sets, great job!

3	*y* :-)

2	I've got it also, but i think i'll replace the ball joint pieces with the kind of pieces that give the wings their angle.

3	great review *sweet* maybe i will buy this one... but not this month... buying lego in billund has left me totally broke :-X :-$

3	i like the dropship kit and got this.

3	Now that I built it I see so many things I can do to tweak it to make it a MOC.

3	I think this is a set everyone MM fan should get.

3	Nice review!

3	The dropships looks neat, and your review is good.

3	It isn't my theme, but it clearly is a fantastic set for the space lovers under us.

3	Mars Mission is really a good step in the right direction for TLC.

1	Of course, right before I post this I see that Ickelpete reviewed this set earlier in the week.

1	Sorry for being redundant but it is already written so here ya go: Monster Dino Reviewed by Dunamis Set 4958 792 Pieces $89.95 from LEGO Online Store Build time 3.5 hours Here we go with another offering from the Creator line.

1	I?m kind of fond of these sets as they are pretty imaginative and usually have instructions for multiple models.

1	I like the reusability of all the pieces and the varied things you can build.

1	The Box: The box that LEGO shipped this thing in was absolutely huge!

1	When I first got this in the mail, I thought I had won the lottery and they had shipped the UCS Falcon early.

1	Once I opened the shipping box, I was surprised to see an unusually large Creator set box.

1	The box itself is pretty standard Creator type box but this one shows off the Power Functions prominently on the right side of the box.

1	The back of the box shows some of the motorized features as well.

1	Opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals.

1	We?re back to the reusable cereal box type tab system for those of you who stay up a night wondering about LEGO?s next box design.

1	Inside the box we have a bunch of sealed bags.

1	Immediately the power brick, remote and motors stand out as they are each in individual bags.

1	Also, there are three manuals.

1	The Manuals: The three manuals are 76, 76 and 56 pages in length.

1	They are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings: - Piece call outs for each step - Parts inventory at the end of the primary model build - Page numbers Color separation in these manuals were fine for me.

1	Interestingly, the instructions for the primary build took a full manual plus about a quarter of another manual.

1	Random manual photos: Parts list I?ll explain a bit more below, but it would have been nice to have some written documentation on all the functions of the motors, remote and receiver.

1	Such as motor load guidelines and specific explanations of all the remote control functions.

1	It is severely lacking in this area.

1	The Pieces: Obviously, the pieces we?re most interested in are these new motors and wireless remote control.

1	Note that before you fire this bad boy up, you had better BYOB.

1	Since this is prominently a European community, I had better clarify my acronyms.

1	Over here across the pond, BYOB usually means ?Bring Your Own Beer?.

1	In this case, it still means bring your own beer (I?m on my second Heineken right now) but in addition to numerous bottles of beer you will need a total of NINE batteries to get through this set.

1	I kid you not: Anyway, there are two motors (a small and a large) each with its own very unique name according to the manual; the smaller one is called ?motor?

1	and the larger one is called ?XL motor?.

1	Very creative indeed!

1	The battery box takes SIX AA batteries and there are two compartments to hold them.

1	Here is the first: That seems pretty normal.

1	However, the back side of it holds the other three batteries and it seems to be very poorly designed: Note in the photo above where the bottom battery is placed.

1	Compare it to the previous photo and you will see the difference.

1	I played around with trying to get that bottom battery out and you better pack a lunch (or BYOB) because it is no small task!

1	Why couldn?t they make this compartment just like the other side?

1	There is a single power cord connector and a three position switch.

1	The middle position turns the power OFF and the other two positions seem to provide the same functionality in either position as far as I can tell.

1	Perhaps a little blurb in the manual would have been nice to clear things up a bit.

1	The remote takes three AAA batteries.

1	It is fairly small and lightweight even with the batteries installed.

1	It has two thumb controls which could be levers if you insert Technic bars or even pins.

1	The two controls are color coded and match the plugs on the receiver to control two separate motors.

1	In addition, there is a four position switch which I assume changes the channel.

1	Finally, there are two tiny levers that seem to have no function.

1	I?m not sure if they are a trim control or variable speed control.

1	I messed with them and didn?t notice any difference in the motor speed.

1	Again, some documentation from the incredibly verbose LEGO manual would have helped.

1	As far as the rest of the parts, it?s really a mixed bag.

1	There are a lot of varied parts in this set to the point that there is almost one of everything.

1	Lots of Technic gears, pins, studded beams, studless beams, axles, wheels, etc.

1	Also, lots of little 1x1 slopes in various colors, teeth, horns, etc.

1	You can?t really say it is a parts pack because there is not enough of one thing to make it a parts pack.

1	A couple of notes: It seems the quality control issue on the axles has been fixed.

1	I initially reported this back when I reviewed the 8285 about a year ago.

1	All the axles worked fine for me.

1	The color quality control issue is still alive.

1	Check out the different shade of red in these two parts: Also included is the sound brick.

1	This looks just like the other sound or light-up bricks we have been seeing lately.

1	It does have a load dinosaur ?roar!?

1	sound embedded in it though so hide the younglings if they are a bit on the skittish side.

1	Finally, I?ve never seen one of these before (although someone will no doubt rattle off a dozen sets where you can find this part in about 5 seconds): No, I am not referring to the studded beam, I put that in the photo for scale.

1	The Build: The build was fun and was fairly straightforward.

1	As I mentioned, there is a lot of Technic parts, so if you are not a fan of the Technic line you should run, not walk away from this one.

1	There were no gotchas to speak of, but you need to pay careful attention to the placement of the wires that go from the motors to the receiver.

1	They kind of sneak them around a bit so watch closely.

1	Otherwise, it was fine.

1	Here is what is left over: So far, I have only built the primary model.

1	As seen on the box, there are instructions for two more models.

1	Both of the other models seem less complex than the primary model and are likely quicker builds.

1	The Dino took me about 3.5 hours which included some time to screw around with the motors.

1	I?m an old school Technic fan from way back in the 80?s so I had some familiarity with the old Technic motors.

1	Obviously, 25+ years has improved some things and these seem much more powerful.

1	The Design: If you have built the 4507 Prehistoric Creatures then some of the design will feel familiar, especially the head and tail.

1	It is almost like they took the dinosaur from that set and figured out how to motorize it.

1	This is not necessarily a bad thing, just a comment.

1	The set does a good job of showing off the features of the new motors and remote.

1	It is nice to see how one motor can perform multiple functions.

1	In this case, the small motor makes both arms move and opens and closes the mouth of the dinosaur.

1	When the mouth is completely open, it pushes the activation switch on the sound brick which emits the ?roar!?

1	sound.

1	Pretty cool.

1	The ?XL Motor?

1	handles the walking feature of the dinosaur.

1	There is both forward and reverse.

1	Forward works really well while the reverse just makes the dinosaur look like he is doing a Michael Jackson moon walk.

1	(Wow, I never thought I would use Michael Jackson?s name in a LEGO Dinosaur set review!)

1	It is almost like the dinosaur can?t get traction going in reverse.

1	However, as noted previously forward works really well.

1	This guy actually gets going at a pretty good clip.

1	As you might expect, he kind of waddles like a duck since there is no articulation in the knees.

1	It is a bit awkward but it works.

1	The ?XL Motor?

1	seems to kick out plenty of power.

1	Overall, the design seems to be a mixed bag.

1	The way the tail is attached seems to be an afterthought.

1	The arms look to be too small.

1	However, the walking mechanism and legs/feet are pretty cool as well as the head and mouth.

1	I guess it is a reasonable effort to get people introduced to the parts and we?ll see designs improve as time goes on.

1	Here are a few views of our new friend: But What About The AT-AT???

1	Of course, the real reason you are reading this is that you hope I will have some epiphany on how all this relates to the new walking AT-AT.

1	Judging from the box on the AT-AT, it looks like we get one motor.

1	I don?t see the remote which is a disappointment as I hope it is not controlled by a switch on the body and you either turn the AT-AT on or off.

1	If that is the case, the first thing I am doing is scavenging the receiver and remote from this set to add to the AT-AT.

1	Granted, it could be that it comes with a remote but is just not seen on the box.

1	Also, the AT-AT box looks like one of the images shows that the head turns.

1	I sure hope this is controlled separately as it would be really lame to not be able to control this independently from the walking feature.

1	I?m kind of skeptical on the walking feature of the AT-AT.

1	I suspect it will be rather cumbersome but hopefully I will be pleasantly surprised.

1	Needless to say, this is all speculation but those are my initial thoughts based on this set.

1	Overall Thoughts: It?s an OK set.

1	Kind of pricy but I suspect a large part of that is due to the motors and remote.

1	I haven?t built the other two models (they seem less interesting to me) but at least it has some variability.

1	Also, you get a ton of different parts which can either be a good thing or bad thing depending on what you are looking for.

1	The dinosaur is average.

1	The color selection is marginal (black and lime green?)

1	and the tail section is just lame.

1	I appreciate it more for the mechanical functions and how the motorized parts work.

1	It does do a good job of waking up my dog who seems pretty irritated by it.

1	It is a nice set to show off to the neighbors or the endless caravan of my wife?s friends that seem to materialize out of nowhere.

1	People are quickly impressed by it and then promptly move along once you start trying to explain how it all works.

1	I?m a bit disappointed that the manual did not explain more about the remote and motor functions.

1	I suspect that there is more than meets the eye and I?ll just have to play around with it to find out.

1	It would be nice if LEGO had a website that showed all the cool functions of the motors and remotes so we fully understand the capabilities.

1	Final Rating: 72% Build 9/10 (Pretty quick and fun.

1	The mechanical part is cool) Functionality 6/10 (It is a Creator set so you have multiple builds.

1	As far as it being a dinosaur, it?s just OK. Motorized parts are cool though.)

1	Design 6/10 (Partly cloudy.

1	Some things are cool, others are lame.)

1	Parts 8/10 (New motors and remote are cool.

1	Lots of varied parts included but nothing to write home about.)

1	Price 7/10 (It is kind of expensive) Edited by WhiteFang, 23 May 2009 - 06:23 PM.

3	Impressive review!

3	Really clear photos too!

3	Thanks.

3	Dr. S.

2	A very nice review, thanks dunamis.

2	*y* I really don?t understand that color scheme, but the new motors?re very interesting.

2	Well, that Dino is just mediocre to me....

2	I think that the new Technic Bulldozer is much more interesting.

3	Great Review Dunamis I hope you have as much fun with this as I have.

3	One point yes they are new axles they have appeared in a few sets this year.

3	Yes, the kids seem to love it (as you pointed out) and the wife still thinks I am crazy so it's all good.

3	I read your review after I posted mine.

3	Seems like we shared the same thoughts on a majority of it.

3	I always think it is good to have multiple opinions on sets as it gives the community more data points to evaluate a given set.

1	I already made my 5 cents to this horrible colour bastard :-X :-X :-X in Ickelpetes thread, but I wanted to clarify about this: dunamis, on Jul 13 2007, 10:41 PM, said: Finally, I?ve never seen one of these before (although someone will no doubt rattle off a dozen sets where you can find this part in about 5 seconds): Here?s one of the sets it?s included in: It didn?t even take me 5 seconds.

3	Thanks for the bonus review.

3	I am still on the fence with this one so every opinion is good!

3	dunamis, on Jul 14 2007, 07:41 AM, said: But What About The AT-AT???

3	In case you don't know, the AT-AT in the Dark Side Development Kit had a single motor and a moving head.

3	It worked by the head simply swinging from side to side due to balence shifts.

3	I suspect the AT-AT will be same.

3	I also think that there will be no remote for it either.

3	Edited by Sinner, 14 July 2007 - 11:31 AM.

3	Tks once again Dunamis for a great in-depth review ;-) I really look forward to your supped up and moded AT-AT :-P I am really not found of the design BUT I think its still a nice parts pack, especially with all these nice "power function" elements ;-) *yoda*

3	Thats a nice looking dino set there!

3	Great review, dunamis!

3	Also, on this side of the border (see that big thing above the US?

3	Thats Canada, where I'm from) BYOB still means bring your own beer.

3	My uncle is already on his third Molsons.

2	Quote Here?s one of the sets it?s included in: It didn?t even take me 5 seconds LOL, I knew it!

1	Oh, is he ugly or what?

1	I've never seen a dino that needed to go on a diet more then him.

1	:-D But I'd get him for the pieces; all those lime-green pieces.

1	*drools* But, meh, I'm not really in to Mindstorms, so I don't think I'd get this.

1	But anyway, nice review, I now know exactly what he's like.

1	KML

3	Wow...that set is really something.

3	But I prefer Pehistoric Power, and Triceratops.

3	Or are they the same?

3	I can never tell.

3	Awesome reveiw, thanks!

3	I gotta get this one!!!

3	*y* *wub*

3	I kind of like the design of this, but more importantly I really want to get my hands on the power functions motors and IR control system.

3	I'd prefer the 8275 Technic Bulldozer, but there's no way I can stretch to the ?100 price tag, so I was thinking I would have to see if I could get a 4958 Monster Dino cheap in the January sales.

3	Then two things happened today.

3	Firstly I saw the Dino in Tescos reduced from ?70 to ?55.

3	Then my wife said she'd buy it for me for Christmas.

3	Wow!

3	That's never happened to me before.

3	I love my wife!

3	*wub* Can't wait till Christmas now!

2	If you really want the power functions the Bulldozer is better value as you get two large motors, two small motors and two receivers compared to the one in the Dino set alos watch Toysrus and argos both have had the Bulldozer for ?70-75 in there pre christmas sales usually for a week only I am hopeing they will be on sale soon as I want a Second Bulldozer to get some more motors.

2	Thanks for the tip, but even ?70-75 is too much right now.

2	?55 was just about affordable, but now my wife's buying for me it's going to cost me zero zilch zip nada nothing which is even sweeter!

2	X-D

2	I ended up buying both this and the dozer.

2	:-$ I plan on using my Dino for a IR car in a month or two...

3	I ended up buying a MISB set recently from a Lego collector who is clearing up his collection.

3	Excellent set to get the IR remote and IR receiver and other motors without paying insane amounts for the bulldozer now.

3	There is a quite a number of parts in Power miner lime green and 1x1 white teeth plate for the mouth and claws.

3	The dino alone has 20 teeth in its mouth The glow in the dark "antennas" on the backbone of the dino is a nice touch as you can let him walk in the dark somewhat.

3	I do agree with the reviewer, the box IS INSANELY HUGE!!!

3	I don't think Lego wanted to show a 1:1 scale dino, they just wanted to promote the power function stuff as large as possible.

3	Also, the remote is smaller than shown in the picture as the hand holding it I think is smaller.

3	This is both my first set review and post about a Star Wars set- (even though I have been collecting them since '99).

3	I got this one early this year so I thought I would post a review on it.

3	Please bare with me- I am not a great photographer.

3	So with that in mind, here goes!

3	Of course we get an extra stormtrooper: 75083 AT-DP Minifigs by whitesidewjw, on Flickr No new molds in this as far as I can tell, however these printed 4X4 domes are really great.

3	I like the two AT-DP Pilots and Agent Kallus is a well done minifig.

3	I can complain about another storm trooper either Parts- 3/5- Other than the dome pieces I commented on before, there is really not any new parts in this.

3	If you build space, star wars, or machinery, this will still be a welcome assortment.

3	Experience of Build 4/5- This really was a fun build.

3	It came together fast but was challenging enough for its target age group.

3	Playability 5/5- This thing is much more sturdy than it looks.

3	The legs take a little bit of effort due to the double locking hinges but hold together very well.This is a very minor complaint.

3	Value 4/5- Typical- $49.99 for 500 pieces- I must admit I paid a little more than MSRP due to shipping but I can't complain about the value.

3	Overall: 21/25- I really believe this is one of the best walkers that Lego has designed.

3	The only changes I would make would be adding real control panels in the cockpit and it would be nice if lego made a real widow to fit in with these types of builds rather than a transparent tile over another plate.

3	All in all, I would recommend this set and I hope the rest of the 2015 Star Wars sets are on par with this.

3	Thanks for the early review!

3	I don't know much about the rebals show at all, but I can say that the over all design of the walker really appeals to me and the minifigs look top notch.

3	I also like how the spring shooters are pretty much hidden in the frame, nice job!

1	Looks really nice.

1	One complaint is the back it is a pitty that Lego didn't use any plates greebling there.

3	Great review!

3	Thanks for doing it.

3	I'm a big fan of this set, the minifigures are good, as is the parts selection.

3	I like the piece used in the cockpit to secure the minifigure in place.

3	I would've liked to see some panels in the cockpit though rather than translucent red pieces, that said however they are useful pieces.

3	Thanks for the review.

3	Cannot wait for the 2015 sets.

3	Pretty good first review!

3	This looks pretty great, I probably won't be getting it due to budget constraints.

3	(Bionicle) but still, very nice set.

3	To me it kinda looks like the missing link between when the at-st evolved into the at-at.

3	Also, I know the rebels stormtroopers get a lot of hate, but I really like them.

3	Thanks for the review!

2	Thanks for the review!

2	I have two questions: - What is the driver standing on, when the hatch is open and he is looking out?

2	- Could you show the face of Kallus without helmet, please?

2	My only complaint is that the colours of both, Kallus's and the drivers's uniforms are wrong.

2	Kallus's uniform is way too dark and should be more dark olive than black, and the drivers's uniforms are too bright and should be more greyish compared to what we saw in the series.

2	Whats behind the printed 4x4 dome?

2	Is that 2x4 yellow plate?

2	Im planning to replace that.

3	Great first review!

3	As a huge walker fan its great to get one thats not a redesign, or one of those tiny battlepack vechicles.

3	Indeed his face printing is really nice, they captured his looks and spirit well.

2	Great set, really impressed.

2	Odd that Lego didn't include stickers for the controls - can't think of a reason they wouldn't have.

2	And why do only 3 of the 4 figures have leg printing?

2	I just can't understand Lego at times

2	namioik, on 25 December 2014 - 08:53 AM, said: I mean, it fits the 10 cents per piece count and has 4 figures so for a licensed theme you can't beat that.

2	But I guess Lego can never satisfy everyone This is true.

2	I just had that price in mind when I saw the first images of it.

2	it did not appear to be this big or complex, but new sets are getting so much more advanced than what they used to be.

2	I built this set and I think the two rubber pieces holding the both sides of the face is a bit stretched out therefore making the set somewhat tight for entire top hatch to open and close.

2	Does anyone have the same situation?

2	Is this right?

2	-------------- Never mind I got it!

2	I built the back a stud too long!

2	Edited by namioik, 29 December 2014 - 03:04 AM.

2	Thanks for the early review!

2	How tall is this next to the most recent recreation of the AT-AT?

2	I'm picturing the two of them standing next to each other looking silly due to the scale differences.

2	The legs are about 2" shorter than the AT-AT; its cockpit is a little larger than the AT-AT's "head;" it doesn't look out of place as an escort-type walker or heavy walker, especially as both are built in the same style, although if scale differences really bother you the most recent AT-ST is probably a better bet for you.

1	Great reveiw, shame on Lego for forgetting that they already made a AT-DP pilot helmet (Ezra's from the Phantom set) that didn't resort to needing a printed head.

2	It's a different helmet.

2	Ezra's is an Imperial Cadet Helmet (the same one he wears in "Breaking Ranks).

2	Thanks for the review and pics.

2	This is a really nice looking walker.

2	One question - how snug are the AT-DP drivers sitting in their seats?

2	The cockpit looks good.

2	Actually I'm not crazy about the AT-DP helmets on the show but I dig the minifigs!

2	Good stuff.

2	Awesome facial hair for Kallus!

3	Knightsword, on 01 January 2015 - 02:27 AM, said: I meant the mold opposed to the paint job.

3	The mold wouldn't really work.

3	The way they did it is actually very accurate.

2	hi, i need some help...when i atach the pod to the place where the legs are placed, the small piece that unites the pod to the legs is loos from the bottom, so the top of the walker just moves around freely, wich is different from every video review that i have seen (where they can rotate the pod but its not loose) the small piece that serves as the axis isnt staying locked on the bottom piece and i have reassembled it all and still its the same :\ help!

2	edit: sorry, i found out what went wrong...didnt push hard enough :D Edited by mrpinache, 05 July 2015 - 12:10 AM.

3	Super outstanding review!

3	I am outside at this moment and this review is certainly great to read while you are on the move.

3	I am looking forward to get this upcoming new modular.

3	It is definitely fun to play and real awesome indeed.

3	Thanks Oky for this very fine review.

3	A great review of an obviously fantastic set.

3	A must-have for 2015!

3	Thanks!

3	I want more of the story you made!

3	Also, ace review.

3	Brilliant review and thanks for plenty of detailed shots of the interior, I may invest in this set but ill have to wait until 2015 Star wars is sorted and budget for the arrival of Pirates in April!

3	Fantastic review, could easily be the year's best, and it's only January 1st!

3	You've got a duplicated picture in the bit where the candy is being moved from the outside and through the barber shop.. ...and I was expecting a final B&W picture or two where the detective makes his report to the woman in red, and gets his reward (candy, of course) or she in turn reports back to her real boyfriend, the candy smuggler.

2	How was the pool table legs made?

3	Firstly, Great Review ++++++ I was really on the fence on this one.

3	This review has greatly changed my view on this modular.

3	A definite buy for me.

3	Love the interiors and the whole concept.

3	The more i see it the more i see the little features which put this set apart or at least slightly different from the others.

3	Of course great playability for the younger lot and i think a nice building to give any Lego City more character and colour...

3	Great review Oky!

3	I really love your introduction text.

3	You put a lot of effort in this review, with lots of nice touches.

3	Well done For me the set gets 4 out of 5.

3	It's a great set, but there's something preventing me of giving it 5 stars.

3	Wow, that is the best start to a review I have ever seen.

3	Great job Oky, amazing set, I'll be picking it up this weekend!

3	Great review Oky!

3	I managed to pick this set up a few days ago and I must say, it might be my favorite modular yet for the feel alone.

3	The pool hall, barbershop, and the detective's office itself are all wonderfully designed!

2	Can you please take some pictures/explain how the water tower is built?

2	I understand that there are some tank treads bot how exactly?

2	And it is "There can be only one"!

3	Looking forward to picking up this set on Saturday :-) Nice review, love the tiny details and the printed parts.

1	Great review!

1	The intro was great, but I'm still not convinced on this one.

1	The height seems too small for comparison with the rest of the modulars.

1	The play features are ok but I wish it would have been taller.

2	Nice review, thanks a lot.

2	Managed to improve my opinion of the set a bit, but I'm still getting two to build larger buirldings as soon as we get the next 2x VIP points special

1	Totally agree with you, the height does seem rather small.

1	Also 2x buildings on a 32x32 base-plate with a lots of spare studs behind the buildings are these buildings 12 studs in width?.

1	It still looks great style wise, however this might be a set i buy and look at it after i have built it & regret the amount of $$$ i have spent on it.

1	$239 for us Aussie's .

3	This modular building will be my next set!

3	Thanks for the review!

2	Thank you for the review, it was very interesting and changed my opinion of the set, I'm now considering a future purchase ^^.

2	Just one question: The mirror is on cardboard?

2	I was hoping for it to be a window piece with a mirror on one side..

2	I hope it's not the same cardboard we had on some of the early Harry Potter sets or the element won't last long

2	Thank you for the great review of this set.

2	I'm also curious for the backside of the mirror.

2	Both are are 14 deep on the upper floors.

2	DO is 3 studs deeper on the ground floor, buit that's pretty much it.

2	Can't believe how cramped the upper floors of the barber shop look.

2	We've come a long way from the wide and empty halls of CC and GG.

3	Amazing review!

3	Very thorough with lots of details

3	Thanks for the review!

3	I'm a fan of the set but will be modding quite a bit.

3	Have to get a small bar into the Highlander and then turn the second/third story above the barber shop into a proper apartment.

3	The detective's office is great and will stay as is!

3	Thank you for the amazing and really well-readable review!

3	Makes me want to get the set even more!

3	Awesome review, and an awesome set.

3	What are the different shades of blue?

3	I know there's dark and medium blue, but what's the other blue?

3	Locutis

3	AWESOME review 'Oky'.....thanks for the cool writing and excellent photography........your last photo could of had a cry of......."You'll never take our candy !

3	"......well he does look Mel Gibson like !

3	This set is a serious contender for best set for 2015, so much detail .........must buy one, need to brainwash wife into buying me one !

3	Lego's affiliation with six wheelers go back a long way.

3	I think the first one was released in 1981, more than 25 years ago.

3	This year, Lego added another one to the family, Mars Mission's "Rhino 1", as its title sounds...

3	It's been a while since i've bought and opened a large box, so maybe this isn't a surprise to most of you, but the box does not open at the front, as with many larger sw boxes, but at the side.

3	The two printed seals(or whatever people call them) have gone as well, being replaced by one larger print in the middle of side... the box also isn't as thick as a large sw box, like the sandcrawler...

3	The general size is, however, still quite large.

3	PICT0001.JPG 281.91K 102 downloads the back side shows the Mars Mission theme sets... eccept the Rhino!

3	I guess it shows this set will be released as a TRU exclusive or something, only to show up in Legoland shops and maybe Lego shops...

3	It's a shame really, because this is by far the best set of the theme.

3	PICT0002.JPG 285.42K 89 downloads When you open the front cover, you see a larger picture picture of the Rhino.

3	Obviously, it seems to be some sort of multifunctional truck.

3	i think the basic function is to drive around and explore.

3	For that it has a drilling device and six giant wheels.

3	PICT0003.JPG 273.7K 82 downloads The set comes with two instruction books.

3	i'm afraid to say they did not resolve the gray/black colors issue.

3	Colorwise, the real thing does not look like the instruction book because of it... PICT0004.JPG 302.63K 75 downloads The Rhino looks really big because of the six giant wheels.

3	I guess it's more or less the same size as M-tron's Magnetiser with the big difference between the two being that the wheels have been turned around, creating a unique wheel design for a Lego model PICT0285.JPG 290.59K 83 downloads PICT0277.JPG 286.26K 80 downloads the wheels look very cool, even though the first couple of wheels stand a bit closer to each other.

3	Don't know why that is.

3	hm... |-/ and they could have used a bit more body, but the design is pretty good.

3	i know, "Armagheddon" isn't far away... |-/ PICT0292.JPG 216.75K 70 downloads The suspension of the wheels is a bit flimsy.

3	sure, it allows the truck to move around in a more realistic way than the old sets, but it's not as flexible as some older sets, like sw's CTT.

3	Nor do the wheels have much body.

3	the black bars you see on top of the wheels are more "window dressing" then functional... PICT0293.JPG 244.78K 88 downloads The over all shape of the Rhino is kinda "bulky", it looks more like a beatle than a rhino, if you're asking me.

3	It has three major sections, but i wouldn't call it a modular building though...

3	The cockpit is the first section.

3	It's spacious and detailed.

3	PICT0290.JPG 262.77K 0 downloads PICT0291.JPG 299.75K 87 downloads The cockpit hangs down from a weird angle.

3	it's attached to a large vertical technic brick that is part of the Rhino's main structure, so it's not a seperate spaceship, which is a shame... oh well... you can't have it all, i guess... PICT0301.JPG 291.13K 78 downloads ah yes... stickers all over the place, but they're cool.

3	the mid section of the Rhino dominates the basic shape of the model.

3	It's as if those two large white parts form a strong and thick shield, protecting whatever is inside from whatever is outsde.

3	PICT0007.JPG 213.22K 67 downloads unfortunately, there is nothing inside.

3	it's extra space needed to house the spaceship.

3	That's really a shame; a command center of some kind could have given the rhino a bit more "panache".

3	PICT0286.JPG 251.35K 87 downloads However, what's really great, is the way in which they fit together: one side has an orange 1x2 plate that fits in between two white 1x3 plates of the other side, creating yet another unique shape for a Lego model.

3	But again, it's a shame they didn't do more with this section... X-O PICT0283.JPG 287.75K 82 downloads The third and last section is a platform for a space ship.

3	PICT0299.JPG 289.5K 77 downloads PICT0287.JPG 199.78K 75 downloads The platform itself isn't really special.

3	no details, no stickers,... it's just a skeleton to carry the spaceship, nothing more nothing less.

3	No, your space ship doesn't fall off, even if you rotate the platform into a launch position, pushing the weight of the ship backwards.

3	In fact, the position of the ship onto the platform is so solid, it's kinda difficult to imagine how this ship flies off.

3	|-/ The ship on the other hand, is pretty cool.

3	It's all sorts of things at the same time it seems.

3	It transports two aliens, but also a small car that reminds me of the small sets of Spacepolice 2, blacktron 2,... PICT0295.JPG 307.4K 85 downloads PICT0298.JPG 268.13K 75 downloads PICT0294.JPG 276.84K 76 downloads the shuttle reminds me of a Star trek shuttle and i think it needs some modding, but i do think it looks pretty nice.

3	sure, the cockpit is a bit too low, a pilot needs to lay down instead of sitting down and the dropping mechnism, if there is one at all isn't all that brilliant either...

3	The main structure is a bit too technical for me.

3	I prefer actual parts with studs, not these Lego technic bars and pins.

3	PICT0006.JPG 224.43K 74 downloads the crew: PICT0276.JPG 239.43K 70 downloads ah yes, there's also this green plastic residu.

3	think they are supposed to be the aliens... and there's also this weird alien craft, but i didn't bother to build that... *sad* GOOD: *wub* Great, innovative design, lots of potential, i even like the colors *sweet* Lots of playability it's a big, attractive model; i don't see any weak spots in the design that could compromise stability or structural integrity.

3	NOT SO GOOD: |-/ too many technic parts, some sections on the model, like the gun and the drilling device are a bit to flimsy I'd say 7.5-8.5/10 Price: 750 Danish Crowns, about 105euro

3	Thanks very much.

3	I love it *wub* .

3	It needs tweaking, but isn't that half the fun?

3	Incidentally, when people were calling it Rhino, I thought it was just a reference to Captain Scarlet.

3	Seeing the stickers in the middle made me realise my mistake.

3	Buy!

3	Buy!

3	Buy!

3	Thanks dude.

3	This is a great set.

3	Can you please take more pictures?

3	Thanks

2	seems like they infuse system sets with more technic bars.

2	must be that technic isn't selling too well and they want to educate ppl how cool technic can be.

2	:-P it's quite apparent when even the small bike needed technic frame.

2	my guess it's less expensive and complicated to produce.

2	they're also using these parts in other themes, so in the end, they're producing a smaller catalog of bricks but every part gets produced in larger quantities.

3	Wow.

3	This year, my wallet size has been bugging me.

3	*Sigh* still, it's a good-looking set and i will get it.

3	Too many big sets...

2	This is a great review and so is the set *y* I thought I would buy it, but when I saw the price...

2	I changed my mind X-D I always liked flying things better though... Like the Dropship...

2	Although that is a BIT pricey too, I guess X-D

2	This set is truely incredible, a must have.

2	BUT this set is also incredibly overpriced *n* !

2	Com' on it's only a big vehicle , nothing really special to justify the near 100?

2	price tag.

2	This set is clearly worth something like 65?

2	at max.

2	Look at the incredible dropship for 34?, that's a good value for money!

2	*y* Edited by mutex, 15 July 2007 - 04:57 PM.

2	Thanks for that very interesting review, snefroe1.

2	*y* That vehicle looks really nice, with a lot of playability, but too much Technic brick construction for my liking.

2	It seems like there?s pretty much space wasted inside of it, some kind of small laboratory or a room for the crew and at least a mining toolshed would?ve been cool.

3	Awesome review, if I pick up any MM sets, it will definately be this one!

2	I echo the consensus of this thread - too much technic, looks great, too expensive, looks great.

2	Please build the alien craft, I'm sure that we would all like a review of that!

3	That's a great programme, is it not?

3	And I mean both new and old.

3	Anyway, I like this.

3	I'll probably get it when it finally becomes available in the UK.

3	I think there's a few things I'll MOD, but overall it's very nice.

3	Although it's interesting (and slightly creepy) how much the lights at the front look like eyes... And, as I've said many a time before, I love the motorbike!

2	^_^' Bleh, I don't care much about the alien ship, they all look too much alike, the humans would kick the aliens crap out of them.

1	I wish the wheels would be arranged like the turbo tank, this one looks too movable.

3	Nice Review *y* I have quick question though.... Do the crystals fit into the aliens hands?

3	Try and stick one in there,Becuase the new catalog shows an image of an alien holding a crystal Lastly lego should have made the aliens with movable arms and no hole in the middle |-/ I don't want to waste any money so I am only going to grab 1 or 2 of the smaller sets Piranha EDIT:IMO the aliens would win becuase they have superior technology and all they do is have to cut the airtank line and the humans die Edited by Piranha, 20 July 2007 - 01:40 AM.

3	Yes, they can hold the crystals.

3	They can't move the hands ( |-/ ) but they do have the clawlike hand of the droid arm.

3	EDIT: Could you post some general 'beauty' pics of the Rhino and the attached craft, such as front, side, back, etc.

3	All we have of the ship is one top pic... Edited by Mr. Mandalorian, 20 July 2007 - 05:18 AM.

2	Say, I was looking at your pics and then at the instructions and I just realised : haven't you put the stikers on the shield thingies in the middle upside down?

2	I think you did :-D I don't know if I like those new sets, though...

2	I mean they have great shapes and potential, but at the same time, they seem so holey...

2	They're really huge and big but full of empty air and space as well... Well, this one not as much, and indeed it is the best looking set of the lot, though...

2	But I don't think I'll go into that line...

3	snefroe1, on Jul 16 2007, 07:19 AM, said: ok then... i'll do that later on... but I will NOT touch that plastic residu!

3	X-D You touched them to put them in their holders in the ship.

3	So in theory, you will not review them.

3	Anyways, nice review.

3	I don't think I'll get this though.

3	I'm trying to decide between this, moble devastator, or anothe 90$ set.

3	I need to get something large before my B-day...

3	Regards, ~VBBN~

3	8-?

3	such a wonderful machine!

3	Great review!

3	Too bad all my money is going towards the castle theme!

3	>:-( My wallet is planning to kill me!

3	Great review, wonderfully detailed.

3	Don't care for the ship at all.

3	It's that 'technic under a hollow shell' thing like the CTT.

3	If it wasn't for the figures, I would have hated it, and nothing about these figures excites me.

3	I'll end up finding the least number of sets possible to provide at least one of each figure for the general population collection and skip the rest (unless they do as I expect and flop here, thus leading to huge discounts).

3	I like this set ... at half off.

3	;-)

3	The Life on Mars theme was so much better, with the aliens dominating Mars instead of the humans.

3	And the aliens were so much better, with their own names etc.

3	Good times.

3	Anyway, I think this is the best set in the series.

3	It looks so neat and reminds me of the Pelican form Halo.

3	X-D Edited by iamded, 31 August 2007 - 05:11 AM.

1	I agree iamded, Life on Mars, while not even that truly great, was far better than this line!

1	>:-( I am hoping the next space line Lego does takes place in just that!

1	Space!

1	|-/ By the way iamded, I continue to stalk you....... Batbrick Away!

1	>:-)

3	I think the Life on Mars series was great.

3	Although I didn't click until the line was gone that the red hangar on the alien base was for the red mech, and same with the blue one.

3	Man, I was gutted when I realised that, I want those mechs!

3	However, the base was great, with the small mech and the flying crafts.

3	Could the LoM mechs have been the spark of life for Exo-force?

3	8-?

2	Lego 41062 Elsa's Sparkling Ice Castle Lego managed to get a Frozen licensed set in the new wave of Disney Princess sets.

2	However, I'm VERY surprised by the size.

2	It's a $40 set and comes in a small Friends-style box (roughly 12"x12" size) - I almost didn't see it on the shelf when I was looking for it because it's so small.

2	I mean, I know it's only $40 but it's a friggin' CASTLE.

2	And why did Lego only make this a smaller set?

2	If they'd made a $200 Frozen castle they still would have sold every one they could produce.

2	They made big Harry Potter Hogwarts sets and those sure sold.

2	And have you SEEN the toys in the Frozen section of stores?

2	HUGE playsets for Barbie-sized dolls.

2	But I suppose I'm getting the cart before the horse here, reviewing before I've even opened the box.

2	So..... Name: Elsa's Sparkling Ice Castle Set Number: 41062 Pieces: 292 Price: $39.99 Minifigs: 3 Theme: Disney Princess Year of Release: 2015 Links: Bricklink Peeron Brickset The Box The front of the box is standard Lego fare, other than the large Anna and Elsa in the bottom right corner.

2	Oh, and surprisingly, nowhere on the box is the normal minifig lineup.

2	The only way to know what characters are included is to look at the set pictures.

2	The 1:1 This set uses one of the minidolls as the actual size sample.

2	That's probably not a bad choice since the minidolls are not nearly as well known as a minifig.

2	The Back On the back, the play features are shown in insets around a rear view of the castle.

2	Like Friends sets, you also have an array of play accessories.

2	The Seals Is this standard on 2015 sets or is this specific to this set?

2	I've never seen 3 tape seals on a set.

2	Even huge modulars or Technic sets only have 2, so 3 on a set this small seems excessive.

2	Perhaps Lego expects people to try to steal the dolls?

2	If so, why bother with extra tape?

2	A tiny pocketknife makes quick work of the tape so the third strip doesn't even slow you down.

2	The Contents In the box are 2 instruction booklets (bent), a white plate, a sticker sheet, and 3 numbered bags of parts.

2	The Stickers These are very hard to photograph since they're shiny.

2	I mean polished chrome shiny.

2	Those dark lines across the corners are not really there, they're reflections of my ceiling.

2	The Manual Backs The back of one booklet has a Friends "Win!"

2	girl.

2	The other has an ad for the Lego Disney Princess website.

2	That site is SO girly there's even sparkles following your mouse cursor around.

2	So I didn't stay too long or look too deeply.

2	The Sample Page The interior pages of the manuals are on lavender backgrounds.

2	It's standard Lego instructions with part callouts and insets when needed.

2	The Build, 1 The first thing you build is Anna, but I'm not showing that yet.

2	Then you build this little picnic scene.

2	It's tiny but effective, and nice to have something not icy in the set since the movie has the "In Summer" song for Olaf.

2	I'm curious what's in that sandwich though - green and pink?

2	After the picnic is the Olaf build, but I'll save him for later too.

2	The Build, 2 Next is this small sleigh.

2	It has an amazing amount of style for something so small.

2	The curved front and decorative whips on the back make it look sleigh-like instead of blocky.

2	But come on, it already had pink accents, are the pink flowers really necessary?

2	Technically, yes, so the whips can mount to them, but still, it's just over-girly for my taste.

2	The Build, 3 The sleigh needs a ramp to help it rocket along (for a couple inches, at least).

2	The ramp starts like this, with a hidden lime green jumper plate that gets a cookie on it.

2	I couldn't remember anything in the movie like that, so I asked my wife and she couldn't either.

2	A hidden cookie under a hill?

2	The Build, 4 After putting the tilting 2x8 onto the base and adding decorations, this is the result.

2	A lime green bucket holding a pair of ice skates, a flower (in the snow, really?

2	), green and white round studs that I assume are supposed to be grass and snow?

2	The Build, 5 The sleigh looks huge sitting on top of the tiny hill, but it actually works pretty well.

2	Assuming you're on a smooth surface like a table, you can give the sleigh a little nudge and it'll shoot down the ramp and a few inches across the table.

2	The unevenness of the slopes vs the blue tiles holds the sleigh in line well, and the bumps in the slopes don't seem to hamper anything.

2	The Build, 6 Moving on to bag 2.... man that's a lot of colors in this base already.

2	And I'm already starting to feel like there's trans-blue cheese thrown around randomly.

2	The Build, 7 Continuing (and rotating), some steps and even more colors thrown in.

2	Magenta?

2	In Elsa's ice palace?

2	I sure don't remember any of that...

2	The Build, 8 Wait, seriously?

2	An ice cream stand in the castle?

2	That is what the magenta is for?

2	I kinda actually like the looks of it, but it doesn't fit the set.

2	The Build, 9 Spinning back around, now there's a light aqua spiral staircase added along with a roof.

2	This is where I'm really starting to wonder about Lego's thinking.

2	Those light aqua stairs, and the light aqua 1x4 tiles, are exclusive to this set (as far as I know... it's possible some other 2015 sets use them, but nothing in Bricklink yet).

2	Seems expensive (to produce) to me, when there's no huge reason to need them.

2	Another blue for the tiles would have been fine.

2	And the spiral stairs?

2	Really?

2	Elsa's castle is KNOWN for staircases, but NOT spiral ones!

2	There should be a huge straight ice stairway out front or sweeping curved stairs inside, but not a spiral.

2	The Build, 10 And now we finish the tree.

2	Again, why?

2	Where is there a tree next to Elsa's castle?

2	And so weird... with ice hanging from green branches that have both snow and flowers on them.

2	Huh?

2	Did Lego watch a different movie?

2	The Trans-Light Blue Bits Before looking at the upper level, a brief pause to look at some other parts.

2	Here's the 1x2x5 brick in trans-light blue and the 2x4x6 rock panel in glitter trans-light blue.

2	Do those look like the same blue to you?

2	And again, ANOTHER unique part for this set.

2	Why do those rock panels need to be glitter, when Lego made the same panel in trans light blue in 2013 and 2014 for SuperHeroes, Friends, and Chima sets?

2	Apparently Disney REALLY wanted glitter, because there are a bunch of trans-glitter parts in the new Princess sets.

2	There's trans-neon green cones for Jasmine; Ariel, Jasmine, and Sleeping Beauty all get glitter trans purple cones.

2	So there's a bunch of new glitter parts for 2015.

2	The Build, 11 Back to building - time to add the upper level.

2	We get a bedroom with a decent bed, although stickered.

2	The Build, 12 The other side of the bedroom has some little accessories.

2	Perfume and a crown I assume?

2	The Build, 13 Time for walls and a roof.

2	I like the small white macaroni bricks for a wall, but what's with the lavender fence piece in the center?

2	I'll grant that it looks nice (a common white fence would have been a little boring), but it's ANOTHER unique piece to this set.

2	The Build, 14 The very top of the castle is built separately.

2	Not a whole lot to say here other than why is there a torch in an ICE CASTLE?

2	The Finished Castle Once the roof is put on, the castle is done.

2	And that big purple star on top says everything to me about the styling.

2	It just doesn't look like modern Lego to me; it looks like this should be an old Belville fairy tale set from around 1999.

2	If I saw a photo of just the castle with no figs (or picnic blanket), I'd assume that's what it was.

2	The Oops, Not Actually Done Yet Accessories At the end, there's a few bits left to add.

2	There are these dark purple skis (yup, another unique part) in the lower level.

2	Let me tell you, they're a pain to get into that location, at least with my big man hands.

2	More Accessories The top level gets a stickered book.

2	The sticker has a nice castle image on it that is, while not quite exactly the castle from Disney World, VERY Disney-looking.

2	I actually had to google and see if that's the castle they use in their logo.

2	Nope, but it's the same style.

2	The Leftovers There are a LOT of extra parts in this.

2	That's almost 10% of the part count in the set right there!

2	They are pretty useful overall though.

2	It's great to have an extra "carrot" and brown "branch" for Olaf, since you know those will get lost as he's played with.

2	The Figs Finally, the reason for the set.

2	Let's face it, the castle set is just an excuse to make these figures.

2	And they're GREAT.

2	I mean just fantastic.

2	The print on them is just such a good match to the real characters.

2	Compare to the cartoon version from the front of the box.

2	Elsa's hair is a little darker than the cartoon, but overall these are just dead on.

2	If I had to pick out a flaw, it's the "spell" Elsa is holding.

2	It's too bad she can only shoot it forward with her arm down like that.

2	It'd be nice to have the end of the splash part bent 90 degrees so she can have her arm forward and the spell shooting forward too.

2	Oh, one other thing.

2	The minidoll heads don't press down tight to the body like minifig heads do.

2	There's still exposed neck.

2	It looks nice, but it means Elsa's cape can swing around.

2	The Fig Backs Elsa's cape is glittery on the back and you can see the removable bow in her hair.

2	The Full Set One final issue.

2	When you put Anna on the sleigh, her cape doesn't have enough flexibility (since it's a wraparound kind) and so it folds out funny.

2	That's why on the back of the box it shows her standing on the back of the sleigh with Elsa in the seat.

2	Edit: How on earth did I forget to comment on those orange flowers to each side of the castle?

2	I'm pretty sure Elsa did NOT have any flowers blooming outside her castle!

2	The Conclusion Hm.

2	I really wanted to like this set, but I just can't quite bring myself to.

2	It feels like Lego pulled a random castle design from the files then redid it into white and trans blue to look icy and allow a Frozen tie in set.

2	The figs are great, but the castle isn't.

2	I guess the real castle in the movie would be a boring set and this one has play features, but it just is too different for my taste.

2	The Ratings Value: 7/10 - $40 for less than 300 parts is high (especially when so many of the parts are tiny, but on the other hand there's a LOT of rock panels and 1x2x5 trans blue panels), but the figs help save it.

2	Design: 4/10 - Not one of Lego's best.

2	Not as bad as the lows in the 90s, but not a great set.

2	Minifigs: 10/10 - Possibly even a 12/10.

2	They ARE the reason to buy the set .

2	Playability: 8/10 - There are a bunch of play features, but they actually detract from the design, so I had to knock off a couple points.

2	Parts: 7/10 - A bunch of impractical unique parts (how often do you need dark purple skis or a lavender fence piece?)

2	but also a bunch of nice parts if you wanted to make your own icy scene.

2	Overall: 7/10 - A great bunch of figs, but I'd recommend not bothering with the manuals.

2	Just use the parts to build your own castle that's better.

3	Two of my daughters are building this as we speak.

3	I agree the design is a lot smaller than I would have liked, but they're loving it.

3	No question the figures are the real draw here.

3	And at 6 and almost five years old they're doimg a good job building so far.

3	At least for the 4-6 range in my house, this set is a home run.

3	Thanks for the great review, Mostlytechnic!

2	I managed to get two sets for my twin girls for Christmas, and would have to agree with your ratings (the Anna and Elsa figs are indeed excellent)

3	Very nice review, mostlytechinc!

3	Once I saw this set I was interested in it for the colours and pieces...thanks for this review to shed more light onto it!

1	Isn't getting parts in new colors a good thing?

1	It is a shame there is only this one set, I think TLG could make a whole subtheme out of Frozen.

1	I do agree that they overuse lavender and magenta, I don't see why every girl set has to have these sort of colors instead of what would be accurate to the source material .

2	Sure, new colors are good.

2	But cramming a bunch of oddball ones into a single set where they don't even make sense just seems financially unwise for Lego.

2	I'd rather have seen a larger set than light aqua spiral staircase parts.

2	Or lavender tiny fences.

2	Lego made the stairs in dark purple last year for Rapunzel's Tower, and those probably would have been ok here.

2	Or make them in a more useful color like WHITE.

3	Thanks for the review mostlytechnic.

3	I too wish they had done a real castle for this set, it certainly deserved it.

3	My sons and I figure they could have used the old rock monster mold from Rock Raiders in white for the missing snow beast.

3	I will pick it up though for the figs and unique pieces.

1	Thanks for the review!

1	I have the same opinion about the design, looks like Belville.

1	I bought it on Legostore Orlando December 30th.

1	It was impressive.

1	My wife saw them putting on shelf, 8 or 10 boxes.

1	She ran and grabbed the last one!

1	The girls faces around it was indescribable, mix of ecstasy and afraid to loose it.

1	It happened in less than 2 minutes.

1	My 7 yo girl didn't want it.

1	She likes the dresses but hates the movie.

1	Prefers Lego Movie.

1	But my 2 yo girl who never saw the movie grabbed it for good, and we bought it.

1	Lego will sell it like water, but I do not understand why a set so small.

1	It is the WORST SET DESIGN since the introduction of Lego Friends.

1	My 7 yo has more than 50 Lego friends minifigures, all the Lego fiends stores and concluded that the castle had a terrible design.

1	She is 7!!

1	Let's be honest, Lego should have released this sets months before this Christmas and is loosing a perfect opportunity to sell a decent set, with much more pieces.

1	I am wondering if they are going to make another set with the same characters.

1	At the end,.

1	It is just for the minifigures.

1	When I first saw the pictures, I didn't realize that this set had so much color barf going on in it.

1	Also, there is a bunch of stuff that does not fit in with the movie, and it is pricey.

1	The minifigures are nice, but no Kristoff or Sven.

1	I thought about getting this, but this review is pushing me towards no.

1	Yep, my family all thinks they should have made a bigger set, added figs, and just been printing money.

1	This feels massively rushed into production.

1	Which is weird, the other princess sets that just came out look worlds better.

3	I wish Elsa had more of a white hairpiece rather than blonde.

3	But it could be worse.

3	Not a bad set overall, although Olaf doesn't look right without the twigs on his head.

3	Anna is a really nice and accurate fig.

2	The review is very well done.

2	Thanks!

2	I don't know the movie.

2	My key question is whether the bricks in the set will allow to build my own snow/ice creations.

2	Now, with "trans-glitter" being part of the design approach I am not so sure.

2	Can those who have already bought it tell me: can trans-glitter be used as "transparent with snow particles" or is it just terrible?

2	I cannot really tell from the review pic above.

3	I think the trans-glitter blue panels can be icy or snowy just fine.

3	I'm sure that's WHY they used them for this set.

3	Now, if you're looking for realism (like the photos in your sig seem to be), it might be tougher.

3	But I've been thinking about using those big glittery panels to make a waterfall-type scene.

3	I'm literally of the exact opposite opinion to OP here.

3	I love the structure and the parts (this is a fantastic little parts pack that I'll be snagging more of when I find it again)...but I've no use for the figures (not a big Disney Princess fan).

3	It's all about the parts.

3	This set is freaking amazing!

3	:D

3	Well, the good news for you is you're in luck whenever you find sets, since the figs sell for a good bit of money :) Right now the bricklink value of the 3 figs is about $30!

2	The guys over in the historic forum will kill me if my MOCs start to glitter I'll take a closer look when I see the set in a shop (and, as I understand, I can sell the minifigs for the price of the set...).

3	Very nice review indeed and I also can't wait for the release of this set.

3	It will be a superb wonderful addition to the LEGO Disney Princess theme.

2	I'm pretty sure I've gotten other sets recently with three pieces of tape on them.

2	I see the cookie smugglers from the Detective's Office have already infiltrated other Lego themes.......

2	There is a very simple reason for the flowers and green-leaved trees; you should remember from the movie it was actually summer when Elsa set of the eternal winter… The orange flowers do bother me, from a design point of view; I would have liked it better if they were a pink/purple/blue/white color.

2	Same goes for the leafy bits; they could have used the pink/purple ones they are gonna use in the Elves sets.

2	It would have been fantastic if they had given us WHITE leafy bits (like snow covered branches)!

2	I'm sure loads of us could use those in our MOCs!

2	Edited by Bennemans, 13 January 2015 - 06:14 PM.

3	Thanks for the review.

3	This will end up being a must buy for my daughter.

3	Great review!

3	I definitely agree, the minidolls are too awesome and are definitely a must-have.

3	I love all the extra pieces from any set, some of them go on my phone case.

1	So why are there non-winter bits in this set?

1	Doesn't make sense.

1	The picnic is because they wanted a mini-vignette for Olaf to fit into, but the rest of the green and flowers don't make sense.

1	Thanks for the FP, but "a lovely sweet review?"

1	I thought I bashed this set pretty hard

3	This seems to be one of those sets that LEGO really should have released a month before Christmas, it likely then would have been toy of the year 2014,

2	I'm trusting there is something else going on behind the scenes because this should have been a huge set and released in November of 2014 at the latest.

2	Maybe we will see more and better Frozen sets when the post-Christmas consumer spending wave hits.

1	Hello everyone, I am back to share with all of you, another of my Legends of Chima polybags review.

1	It will be pretty comprehensive since the finished built will be quick and will be focusing more of what kind of fun that you can derive from there.

1	This polybag was bought in September 2013, when I visited LEGOLAND Malaysia and I did not hesitate to put this in my shopping basket.

1	Name: 30253 Leonidas Jungle Dragster Theme: LEGO System / Legends of Chima Year: 2013 Pieces: 30 Minifigs: 1 minifigure Price: USD N.A, GBP N.A, EURO N.A, SGD N.A Resources: Brickset, BrickLink An original polybag image of the 30253 Leonidas Jungle Dragster Back view of the original polybag image of the 30253 Leonidas Jungle Dragster The road scout of the Lions Tribe This polybag design is definitely plan to be the quickest and fastest dragster to recce enemy front by making a swift scout for the Lions Tribe.

1	I believe by the sound of the name, Jungle Dragster, it might just be suitable to use in jungle terrain.

1	Well, I don't quite agree that this is a 'Dragster' even though it has the kind of open view concept of rolling in fast but it does not have the length of a typical dragster, similar to this Town polybag design, for example.

1	Still, it is nice to have smaller variants of their vehicular supremacy.

1	Instruction Manual (Front) Instruction Manual (Back) The LEGO building content With just 30 LEGO elements, you can be pretty quick to be able to display these laid out content.

1	After the built is completed, these are the remaining spare parts.

1	I am fond of the wheels which are some useful parts, other than that, there are nothing spectacular about it.

1	My name is Leonidas and I belonged to the Lions Tribe Do not be mistaken of his name, Leonidas to be the King of Sparta who led the brave men of 300 Spartans Warriors to fight to the death against the Persians.

1	Instead this character is based on the bio resided in LEGO.com, you will realise that he is aligned with the Lions tribe and is a proud Lion foot-soldier.

1	He may have that goofy idiotic look but he can be very serious in his commitment to discharging his duties.

1	You are able to observe his nice back view printing which reveal his black and blue sash.

1	Leonidas has a dual facial feature to reveal his much serious appearance.

1	Leonidas is one of the common characters available in the Legends of Chima universe.

1	It can be found in a total of five sets.

1	It is a great pity that there is no weapon being made for him in this polybag design which will certainly make a fine addition.

1	The completed built of the Jungle Dragster This is the main design of the Jungle Dragster which is very simple looking.

1	There is no distinct fighting capability from the vehicular design and it look just like a regular patrol vehicle.

1	One thing I like about this, is the close distinct colour schema of the Lions Tribe.

1	Other than that, there is nothing special about it.

1	Moving off with my Jungle Dragster To conclude, this polybag is really meant for LEGO fans or collectors who appreciate Legends of Chima or wanting to sample the Legends of Chima theme.

1	It is a very simple built, but yet could form a decent force size for recce purposes before sending in the big arsenals to whack their enemies.

1	Either way, I will only suggest you to buy it if you really love this theme at an inexpensive price.

1	Otherwise, it is perfectly alright to give this a miss.

1	Summary review Playability: 4/10 (You need to have more Lions Tribe vehicles in order to bring the best and fun out of it since this is more of a supporting vehicle.)

1	Design: 4/10 (Simplistic built of the dragster and main focus is just acquiring the minifigure.)

1	Price: 4/10 (Bought at about USD$7, which is not an awesome price, so get it if you can get it more than half of this price.)

1	Overall: 4/10 (If only you are a huge mega fan of the Legends of Chima, then you need to get this.)

1	I gave it a "2" based on my Review Score Card.

1	What about yours?

1	I hope every one of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine.

1	Comments and Criticisms are strongly welcomed.

1	Pictures can be found in My Flickr.

3	I love how the front/hood looks like a lion.

1	Good and helpful review again, WhiteFang.

1	I probably have no use for a lionish creature with goofy looks...

2	What's up pups?

2	I have written a review for 7786 Batcopter: The Chase for Scarecrow on my website: BrickZone.net As usual it involves Fabuland figures involved in a crazy story.

2	Enjoy and feel free to let me know what you think.

2	Thanks!

2	X-D click on the picture to read the review...

3	Thanks for this review, I love this set *wub* That batman is great, and I've always loved that awesome scarecrow fig.

3	That new pumpkin is fantastic, I can't wait to get it in the set...how many come with the set?

3	I hope more than two :'-( I love both of those vehicles, this set is a definite buy for me!

3	I want to buy one of the new sets as I would love a blue Batman, but they are so expensive for Australians.

3	I love the new pumpkin heads.

3	The story involved more mini-fig cruelty; excellent!

3	I also liked the scarecrow/crow joke.

3	:-D (One request; please don't say lines like "To the Batcopter" next time.

3	That is the old TV series and I hated that.

2	Great Review *y* :-) Your reviews are so funny They are so much fun to read especially the end part with the comic SPOILER ALERT!!!!

2	(Mum bought it for me.)

2	I tend to put in on if I have friends over and I am drunk enough.

2	I like the darker side of Batman only, and thus anything that is against the idea that Batman is as big a loon as the guys that he hauls in I don't like.

2	Joel schumaker's movies fall well within that category.

2	But I am not too badly done by.

2	I should be buying some more (non-Licensed) Lego goodness tomorrow...

3	When i first saw pic's of the bi-plane i wasn't sure if i liked it or not, but after seeing it in more detail i gotta say i love the thing *wub* It's a great plane with so many good aspect's, it's also the perfect counter vehicle for the new bat-plane.

3	For me though the best part of the set has got to be the new pumpkin heads, those are just beautiful and i cant wait to get lots of them.

2	Nice review.

2	The Batcopter is pretty neat, but I prefer Scarecrow's bi-plane.

2	Quote Batsy: We needed to wrap this review up so I used my Baterang.

2	Bianca: Is that really what it's called?

2	Batsy: Beats me... Nooo... it's Batarang.

1	Great review!

1	Funny as allways!

1	The comic was just a hell lot of fun.

1	It really had me laughing.

1	I would love to have this set but the price is just to high here, far worse than I had expected.

1	I'll be better off buying the Battank, which is much better priced.

1	Actually there is almost no price difference between The Batcopter and The Battank here *wacko*

3	Tks mate for this brilliant review :-D I loved your Batfabuland story !!

3	Always fantastic to read like always *sweet* I really love this set and I shall buy 2 copies: one to build as is, and another one for my town loool: regular biplane for the tarmac, and my swat copter ;-) BTW, I would have a request: could you post pic(s) of the parts inventory please ;-) Many tks in advance !!

1	Christian, on Jul 18 2007, 08:21 PM, said: I would love to have this set but the price is just to high here, far worse than I had expected.

1	I'll be better off buying the Battank, which is much better priced.

1	Actually there is almost no price difference between The Batcopter and The Battank here *wacko* That is insane!

1	*wacko* 450 and 500!

1	Indeed; you should just buy the tank.

1	Comparing the price of the Tank to the Batwing you seem to be getting quite a good deal there.

1	Both are over priced for Australians and the Tank is twice the price of the copter.

1	(They are 60 AUD and 120 AUD.)

1	I am still not sure if I will buy either... :'-( Edited by Sinner, 18 July 2007 - 11:47 AM.

3	Thanks for the review.

3	I'm definitely getting this, mainly becasue it's Batman.

3	I love the blue Bats, the Scarecrow is good as ever, and those new pumpkins are just *wub* .

3	There's a few things I'll MOD, but nothing really major.

3	I'll have to wait till I get this to decide properly though.

2	What a fine review and what a funny story, thanks!

2	*y* Dark tan and new Technic hub.... very interesting.

2	Scare the crow on!

2	:-D

2	Very nice review *y* :-P :-D

3	Sinner, on Jul 18 2007, 08:24 AM, said: I thought you would like it!

3	I am pleased to say that I didn't know that "the jig is up!"

3	was also a common line.

3	Most of what I remember about the old Batman TV show actually comes from the movie as I own that.

3	(Mum bought it for me.)

3	I tend to put in on if I have friends over and I am drunk enough.

3	I like the darker side of Batman only, and thus anything that is against the idea that Batman is as big a loon as the guys that he hauls in I don't like.

3	Joel schumaker's movies fall well within that category.

3	Wait, what?

3	Are you saying you prefer the Joel Schumacher films?

3	If you like the darker side of Batman, I recommend the Tim Burton films.

3	Joel Schumacher is as campy as "the jig is up" IMO.

3	He added freakin' nipples to the batsuit for God's sake!

3	:-P You'd have to be nice and drunk to enjoy his films.

3	;-) I really like Batman, Batman Returns and Batman Begins.

2	If anything, the new film is the best one.

2	And it didn't irreparably kill the baddie at the end... |-/ I love the 60s show, even though I've only seen the movie.

2	Sure it was camp, not Batman, and often ridiculous, but so what?

2	That was the charm.

2	Besides, it's the comics that rule, so there!

2	"Holy opinions, Batman!"

2	:-D

2	What about the cartoon???

2	Batman: The Animated Series will always be the definitive Batman to me.

2	The two Tim Burton movies were okay (they haven't aged well though), and I really dig what Christopher Nolan is doing with the new movies.

2	Christian Bale did a fine job in "Batman Begins" ... but when I watch the movie, I hear Kevin Conroy's voice in my head.

2	The cartoon rocked.

2	And as much as I enjoyed the Justice League Unlimited cartoon, my biggest complaint was always: more Batman please!

3	Excellent hinckley *y* *y* *y* !

3	Looks like a nice set - I like the mix of dark Batman-pieces and a bit lighter Badmans-pieces.

3	Batmans new blue headpiece looks a bit off though.

2	I like the first one (although I have seen it too much now), love the second one and am undecided about Batman Begins.

2	I didn't like how he insisted on wasting time with the backstory, and I especially didn't like the certain over repeated lines like "Mr Wayne, why do we fall down" and "You should learn to mind your surroundings."

3	Out of nowhere this set appeared at my local TRU.

3	Hadn't been expecting this one for a while, so a nice surprise.

3	*sweet* Firstly the box.

3	Nice pic on the front.

3	Good selection of minifigs.

3	The officer and pilot look cool with their dark blue trousers.

3	A new R2 unit as well.

3	Don't remeber this in the film, but great to have one in a new colour.

3	*wub* Back of the box shows some of the ship's nifty features.

3	First thing you notice when you open the box, is the awesome selection of bricks.

3	This makes a for a great parts pack.

3	Loads of unusual red and dark red pieces.

3	It's so refreshing to see a Star Wars set that isn't predominantly grey.

3	There are also two instruction booklets.

3	As soon as you open the first booklet you hit an error.

3	Why would I want two Obi-Wans?

3	:-| It's also at this point that you come across a big disappointment.

3	On the box you get a flesh Qui-Gon.

3	What is actually in the box is an EpIII Obi-Wan.

3	Come on LEGO - why change it?

3	|-/ All the figures look impressive in the flesh despite the BIG mistake.

3	Once I started the build it progressed rapidly.

3	Red pieces seem to be a lot easier to find.

3	Lots of clever techniques.

3	Quite a few Technic elements get used at the start.

3	It reminded me of building a Technic set from the 80s at times.

3	Here is the main body half way through the build.

3	The landing mechanism is a nice touch.

3	Its not fully retractable, but still folds away nicely.

3	You find the ship keeps tipping over as you build it despite the feet, as it's only at the end thay it all becomes evenly balanced at both ends.

3	Here the feet are extended.

3	You can also see the yellow knob that rotates the radar on top of the ship.

3	Landing gear up viewed from the front.

3	Here are the radar.

3	A great collection of dishes.

3	They spin easily with little friction.

3	Here is the ship at the half way point.

3	The front works well with the top flipping up to squeeze in the pilot.

3	More to come... :-)

2	You're second post on this forum and already you bring us this great review.

2	Thanks for making this !

2	!

2	Thanks for this great review *y* :-) And Welcome to eurobricks *n* Whats with the obi wan head???

1	What's up Kernow!!??

1	Nice review.

1	Thanks for sharing.

1	Welcome to Eurobricks, I hope you have fun here!

1	:-D X-D That Qui-Gonn thing is weird.

1	Come on LEGO!

1	Someone is just asleep at the wheel over there with quality control.

1	Missing pieces, injections molds, slipping quality, ice cube trays...IMO, that's a huge thing to miss.

1	The mini-fig on the box doesn't come in the set=false claims.

1	Anyway, the ship looks beautiful and I wanted this set when I first saw it and your review confirms that it is very cool.

1	Thanks again!

3	7665 Review Part 2 The second half of the build goes quicker than the first.

3	Once you start to add the engines, the ship really begins to take shape.

3	The main body of the ship has a few surprises hidden away under a removable cover.

3	Inside you get some retracting guns, a storage box, a little shuttle and space for a droid and figure.

3	Here is everything you can fit inside.

3	The guns are concealed behind the side vents.

3	Pushing them forward causes the vents to open.

3	Closed: And open: The final feature is the passenger area/escape pod.

3	Inside is plenty of space for two figures.

3	The pod cleverly attaches by pushing the front section of the ship forward, sliding the pod in, then returning the front.

3	Everything locks together and is held securely in place by an elastic band.

3	:-) Here's a couple of pictures of the final model.

3	It's not the most beautiful creation ever, but it is an excellent representation of the ship from the film.

3	The angular shape actually suits a LEGO build well.

3	There's one more useful feature.

3	The whole ship can be safely and comfortably picked up by two ball ended Technic pins towards the back end.

3	It balances well at this point and does allow you to swoosh the ship around much more easily.

3	This was the most enjoyable Star Wars build I've had in a long time.

3	Everything progresses nicely with almost no repetitive bits.

3	The ship looks good and is also HUGE!

3	*sweet* Compare it to the 6211 ISD and you'll see it's only fractionally smaller.

3	When I first saw pictures of this on the internet I thought it looked OK. Once you see it for real it is much more impressive.

3	For ?69.99 in the UK I'm not complaining.

3	It's the best value Star Wars set of the year so far.

3	To conclude: Pieces: 9/10 Minifigures: 7/10 (would be a 9 apart from the stupid Qui-Gon/Obi-Wan head error) Playability: 8/10 Originality: 9/10 Set Design: 8/10 Overall: 8.2/10 The box says this is a Limited Edition set (whatever that means).

3	So if you're planning to get it I'd suggest you grab it at the first opportunity.

3	I'm glad I did!

3	Excellent review!

3	This looks like a very nice piece of LEGO-enginereing *y*!

3	Like you I think it looks like the original.

3	I did think though that it was supposed to be a un-armed ship but I can defenitly live with that X-D!

3	The escape shuttle looks roamy enough, a bit dull though but it could have a PS III stached away somewhere, but the other shuttle :-| - come on!

3	Is it for Mini-me when he needs to go and get some burgers & fries?

3	Getting at least two On copmike

3	Thanks for the review!

3	I'm glad to see Lego including details of everyday life, like the food (though a plate would have been nice).

2	Brick Miner, on Jul 31 2007, 07:46 PM, said: as for the set, the thing that jumps out at me most is the use of dark blue for water... im so used to seeing the classic blue for water, that the dark blue seems weird.

2	i don't like it.

2	- BM Indeed, I only noticed this when I saw the S@H images.

2	I guees that they're on dark waters.

2	You can always put some trans blue and trans clear 1x1 round plates, no?

2	I tried that technique to make the lava (using trans red and trans orange plates), it looks neat.

2	Regarding the human soldier thing Yoda mentioned, it's quite weird.

2	Like him, I'm going to swap the legs, so they're coherent with the soldiers from the other sets.

2	Third note: is it just me or did you attach the two black gate pieces too high?

2	Shakar

3	Nice review, I like the building/port the most mmm,dark blue plates *wub* Pity it is a Toys'r'us exclusive, In The Netherlands there are only Toys'r'usses in the greater cities.

2	Shakar, on Aug 1 2007, 01:34 PM, said: Third note: is it just me or did you attach the two black gate pieces too high?

2	Shakar No, I think this is correct.

2	The upper plate with clip for the door is a little high, on top of a dark gray 1x1 brick.

2	So if you want the door to operate well you have to place it like that.

2	I just put the clip under that brick, a very easy fix, so my door now is lower which looks better IMHO, and no sneaky skelly can crawl along under it.... X-D

3	Not sure I like this one much.

3	I like many of the new parts but the boat isn't that great and I would rather get each seperately so I can avoid the whole skeleton army.

3	Nice review though!

3	Asuka is correct.

3	Also keep in mind that the picture was taken looking down on the model that is sitting on the carpet.

3	It makes the gap appear a little larger.

3	In addition; for those of you that recommended ironing the sail, it worked great.

3	I set the iron to low and used a t-shirt to protect the sail.

3	It flattened it out perfectly.

3	In fact, it worked so well, that I did the same with my old WW Weapons Wagon cover that has gotten wrinkled over the years.

3	The iron worked perfectly.

3	Yes, that was definately an optic illusion.

3	Looking at it again, the gap looks a lot shorter.

3	Thanks.

3	:-) Shakar

3	Yes, very nice review Mr Brickster!

3	I think I , for a change, like the castle part better.

3	The ship doesn't look quite right to me.

3	If they're gonna make a pirate theme with ships like this I wouldn't be very happy...

3	But I think the ship brings some nice accesories.

3	Like the anchor, a black mid piece(!

3	), steering wheel etc.

3	I think I'll buy it eventually.

3	Thanks for the review Brickster!

3	It's great to be able to see more views of this set.

3	Ok here is the set alot of us star wars fans have been waiting for!

3	The 7666 Hoth Rebel Base!

3	*wub* First the box Now the great minifigs!

3	That stunning K-3po fig!

3	Now the snowspeeder!

3	AAAAGGGHHHHH these parts are all stickers!

3	Now for the turret!

3	the 2 cones on the side press in to fire out 2 blue lights saber blades :-D Now for the small crane thingy.

3	Yes the part under the engine on the snowspeeder is another sticker 8-| Echo Base!!

3	(well the front door anyway :-D ) The main control room?

3	:-D Again these are stickers on a tinted clear panel and on the slope |-/ I have no idea what this is meant to be!

3	:-D Finally 2 shots of the full set!

3	*wub* Well over all i really like this set and think it is great value for money.

3	The minifigs alone would set you back more than the cost of this set.

3	The build time was a good 2 hours or so and was good fun!

3	The snowspeeder is not as good as the second snowspeeder and no where near as good as the first in my opinion, but i did love that first one.

3	The k-3po fig is perfect and it is good to be getting more droids that aren't r2-d2 and c-3po.

3	It is a shame about the stickers but that is the price of keeping the cost down i suppose (the only printed part in the whole set is the snowspeeder/x-wing windscreen).

3	I will definately be getting atleast another 3 of this great set.

3	9/10

3	I love it.... depending on the Australian price!

3	(If it comes down here that is.)

3	Incidently, I have no idea what that other yellow thing is either!

3	Thanks for the review.

3	Thanks for the review!

3	A very good review, thanks mutley777!

3	*y* Hmm, that shattered base looks better than I thought.... a very playable set, really nice.

3	For the Snowspeeder, I prefer the main gun design of its predecessor, but the grappling hook gun is a good improvement.

3	If the door would just be large enough for it.... :-P

3	don't worry guys, the snowspeeder fits through the door easily :-)

2	Mutley , did you bought it @ TRU?

2	- Are there any other sets?

2	exept of Hoth Base , and is there the republic cruiser?

3	They had all the new star wars summer sets and republic cruiser too!!!

3	There was a girl unpacking sets and saying to me, oh this ones just come in and this one :-D (showing me the republic cruiser, MTT, Jedi with hyperdrive ring, naboo star fighter and the hoth base) I had to leave, or that would have ended up one very expensive morning :-D

3	WoW!!

3	Why didnt you bought 3 of them :-D?

3	Wow, I didn't think we'd get a review so fast 8-?

3	Really nice review, the pictures explain it all *y* :-) I really hope to get this set as it is really great...

3	I guess :-D

3	The snowspeeder is love.

3	great looking set ... how much was it ?

2	?40 I think.

3	sam89, on Aug 2 2007, 04:53 PM, said: ?40 I think.

3	Yep!

3	Very reasonable *y*

3	mutley777, on Aug 2 2007, 05:00 PM, said: Yep!

3	Very reasonable *y* not too bad ... might have to pick that up soon then, I will be in TRU in Southampton over the weekend ;) I think I'll buy the bigger sets here and get the smaller ones in the USA later in the year.

3	The smaller the boxes, the more chance I will have getting them in my suitcase ;) I have to say, I am very glad we are now not getting a 1:1 ratio between the numbers used prices in USA vs UK (e.g.

3	it is not longer ?49.99 = $49.99) :)

3	Excellent set.

3	The snowtroopers are just amazing (most Lego imperial troops are really good).

3	However, it's sad that except from Luke, all the rebels have the same face which is what is more the most unexpressive that you can find.

3	For the rest, the quality looks excellent.

3	The snowspeeder is far better than the first they realized (but only one thing: it looks a bit too white to me.

3	I think I remember they were grey and orange rather than white in the film) and the Echo Base door is really cool.

3	Really nice set.

3	I agree with all your observations, especially stickers versus printed parts |-/!

3	I get some of this and replace the snowspeeders with my v.2?s.

3	Hoth On copmike

3	Great review - NOW I WANT IT EVEN MORE!

3	?40???

3	That sounds reasonable in comparison to our recent experiences!

3	The 7666 Hoth Rebel Base!

3	*wub* First the box Now I really don't know what to get for Christmas :-( :'-( .

3	THe Bi-wing baron or this!

3	And it's quoted because it says LIMITED EDITION?!?!?!

3	I may never get this set now :'-(

1	Man the stickers on everything are really starting to irritate me a lot.

1	I'm not sure I like the white 3P0, in a set that is primarily made up of whites.

1	Doesn't stand out enough.

1	The snowspeeder looks a lot shorter than previous versions.

2	REVIEW - 42039 - 24 HOURS RACE CAR INTRODUCTION When the preliminary images of the "Le Mans Racer" surfaced somewhere last year (2014) it got a lot of praise.

2	This changed dramatically when the final images of the 24 Hours Race Car showed up.

2	The front side of the car, especially the head lights, and the curvature of the side of car had changed a lot.

2	The car obviously still resembled the prototype, but the new design raised a lot of eyebrows.

2	The new design was considered a step back instead of forward.

2	Eventhough I still liked the design, I must admit I liked the earlier design better too.

2	With the emphasis on past tense liked.

2	I am not sure anymore and this review will show you why.

2	Like the Arctic Truck this set has a B-model which is well worth checking out.

2	That's why this review includes both the A-model and B-model.

2	For people who are on the fence, the B-model might actually convince them to buy the set after all.

2	Let's see what this set is all about!

2	Note: All images can be clicked for hi-res versions.

2	SET INFORMATION Number: 42039 Title: 24 Hours Race Car Theme: Technic Released: 2015 Part Count: 1219 Box Weight: 2110 gr Box Dimensions: 47,8 cm x 37,3 cm x 8,7 cm Model Dimensions: 40 cm x 18 cm Set Price (MSRP): €99.99 / $?

2	/ £99.99 Price per Part: €0.082 / $?

2	/ £0.082 Links: Brickset, Bricklink THE BOX The box measures 47,8 cm x 37,3 cm x 8,7 cm and weighs well over 2kg (2110 gr to be precise).

2	The width of the box is the same as the box of the Arctic Truck.

2	This box also feels like it's filled to the brim.

2	THE FRONT The front shows a picture of the main model in action, with radial blurred wheels to emphasize the motion of the car.

2	The lower right section shows the dimensions of the model.

2	Upon completion, it will measure a length of 40cm and a width of 18 cm.

2	THE BACK Like the front, the back side has exactly the same setup as the box of the Arctic Truck.

2	The top shows the functions of the model, while the lower left side shows the B-model and the lower right side shows the motorization options.

2	The picture of the B-model looks so cool, it could be a model of it's own.

2	At this point I was very eager to build both models and compare them.

2	THE SIDE One of the sides usually shows a part in 1:1 scale.

2	This time it's one of the wheels indicating the size of the model.

2	CONTENT OF THE BOX The box contains: 1 Book(let) 1 Sticker Sheet 13 Bags 4 Tires INSTRUCTION BOOKLET Since I own two copies of the set, I also received two instruction booklets.

2	What's catching my eye is that my second copy is supplied in different packaging than the first one.

2	It's for the first time (that I am aware of) that the instruction booklet and stickers come in a sealed bag, without cardboard back.

2	Hopefully this will be a new standard for all sets with sticker sheets.

2	Instead of multiple booklets, this set contains a single square bound book.

2	In earlier reviews I have epxressed my preference for a single book.

2	I don't see any advantage in having 2, 3 or even up to 6 booklets.

2	STICKER SHEET Like the actual model, the sticker sheet looks very vibrant.

2	The bright green, white and black color combination has found it's way to the stickers as well.

2	Either you love 'em or hate 'em.

2	Since I started writing reviews I have been applying stickers and I am happy I started doing it.

2	Stickers do give the model it's finishing touch.

2	BAGS WITH PARTS Thirteen bags with a total of 1219 parts (give or take a few) are supplied in the densily packed box.

2	The rims and flex are sealed in a bag as well.

2	Sometimes looking at the bags makes you wonder what the logic is, behind the distribution of the various parts across the different bags.

2	Well this time it really got me confused.

2	Take a look at two of the bags below.

2	There's a bag containing all the 3L Blue Pins.

2	Then there's a bag with various parts....and a single 3L Blue Pin.

2	I figured this might be an error, but both of the sets have the same anomaly.

2	TIRES The tires have been supplied unbagged, as usual.

2	HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This chapter describes new and interesting parts.

2	This set actually contains a lot of them.

2	This set also contains an abundance of panels.

2	If you aren't into panels, this isn't the set for you.

2	CHANGEOVER CATCH This year (2015) the new changeover catch parts were released.

2	It's a combination of three parts.

2	The advantage of the new parts is that the red gear is the same on both sides, which avoids mounting it the wrong way around.

2	It also avoids the changeover catch slipping out of the driving ring, like it used to do.

2	You can apply lots of pressure, but the catch doesn't slip out.

2	PINS Some of last year's new pins are also included in this set.

2	12 x Pin with Pin Hole and 21 x 3L Pin with 1L Axle.

2	Securing Technic Beams can be quite simple with the new Pin with Pin Holes.

2	The new 3L Pin with 1L Axle gives you more possibilities when connecting Beams and other parts.

2	Below are two example situations where the new pins have been used.

2	Granted, the examples below can be accomplished by using other techniques.

2	However, some predicaments from the past can be easily solved by using these new parts.

2	Like me, you will most likely appreciate the ease of use.

2	ENGINE AND SUSPENSION Also included are two Steering Portal Hubs and Steering Portal Hubs with Ball Joint Arms and four Steering Portal Axles for driving and steering the vehicle.

2	These parts are commonly used nowadays.

2	The picture below also shows some other parts, like gear rack, steering arms and suspension.

2	FRAMES This set comes with a single 5x7 Frame and three 5x11 Frames.

2	PANELS This set contains a whopping 47 panels in three different colors.

2	I personally like panels a lot and I do appreciate the variety we have at our disposal lately.

2	This set even contains a new 13x3x2 Curved "Mudguard" Panel.

2	NEW 13x3x2 CURVED PANEL This is the first set to contain the new 13x3x2 Curved Panel.

2	Looking at the pictures doesn't do these panels justice.

2	In real life they are actually quite big.

2	I figured they would be smaller, but they are even longer than the 11 x 5 frame, with a length of 13 (including the attachment points).

2	Hopefully this part will be available in other colors as well, preferably white, for adding variety to your EV3 robot.

2	19L WHITE FLEX-AXLES The White 19L Flex Axles have only been released in a single set, the 8461 Williams F1 Racer in 2002.

2	Current prices on Bricklink are as high as 15 Euros!

2	Needless to say we are very happy with the return of these White Axles.

2	Now we can build Jeroen Ottens' awesome Alfa Romeo 4C Spider for a decent price as well.

2	I am really happy that useful rare parts are being used more often by TLG designers PART LIST Here's the complete list for all 1219 parts.

2	As you can see in the Highlighted parts section, this set contains a lot of interesting and useful parts.

2	If you don't own sets like the 8070 - Supercar, this might be the set to pick up if you want to start building your own supercar.

2	THE BUILD Enough with all the set and part information, let's build the model.

2	REAR SUSPENSION The build starts with the rear suspension and drivetrain.

2	As you can see in the picture below, the length of the Axle between the Steering CV Joint is 4L, where it usally is 3L.

2	This is an indication that the finished model will be a bit bigger than usual (8070 for example).

2	The finished suspension is one of the cleanest suspension setups I have seen in an official model.

2	It's pretty basic, but it works like a charm.

2	This setup is defintely worth using in your MOC.

2	Here's a video: After attaching the suspension to the frame you rotate the module and secure it.

2	At this stage the rear section of the chassis with suspension is almost finished.

2	V8 MID-ENGINE Extending the chassis forward results in the picture below, where the front spoiler is already visible.

2	What's also visible is the V8 engine placed right in front of the rear axle, resulting in a Mid-engine setup, perfectly suited for sports and race cars.

2	Two exhaust pipes have been fitted on either side of the engine, together with two hoses attaching them to the engine.

2	The instructions are easy to follow, although you sometimes you need to bend the beams a bit.

2	Minor improvements are possible here and there, but nothing shocking.

2	FRONT SUSPENSION The front suspension is a bit more complicated than the rear suspension, which makes sense considering the fact it contains the steering rack.

2	The shock absorbers are placed in a different angle than the rear ones, resulting in a somewhat stiffer front suspension.

2	All in all the front suspension is well designed and the steering rack can be easily powered with a Servo Motor.

2	The picture belows shows the front suspension attached to the chassis.

2	If you follow the official instructions to motorize the model, the area in front of the suspension is used to mount the battery box.

2	When you are modding this model to make it Full RC this area can be used to mount the servo motor.

2	GEARBOX Like the gearbox in the 8070, it's not used to switch gears powering the drivetrain.

2	It's used to switch between two functions, opening the doors and the hood/bonnet.

2	The gearbox is located at the left of the vehicle, near the cockpit.

2	The mechanism to open the doors is located on the left side, while opening the hood/bonnet is taking place at the right side.

2	To accomplish this, some axles traverse under the cockpit to the other side of the vehicle.

2	Following the axles to other side of the vehicle and adding some gears, results in the situation below.

2	The video below shows the gearbox in action.

2	DOOR OPENING MECHANISM The mechanism to open the door is comprised of some Knob Wheels, Links without Stoppers and Pins with Towballs.

2	Take a look at the doors opening and closing.

2	THE FRONT Using the new mudguards and various other panels you finish the front of the car.

2	The front is probably the most controversial part of the car.

2	This is caused by the preliminary pictures shown before the release of this car.

2	In the early pictures the front of the car had smooth curves and beautiful lines, while the final car lost these smooth lines and got a more blocky look in return.

2	I must admit that at a first glance, the new design lost some of it's appeal.

2	However, this model grew on me pretty rapidly.

2	The headlight design can be found, in more or less the same way, on several real Le Mans type race cars.

2	THE REAR The rear of the car looks great, with the stickers continuing from the mudguards to the panels underneath the spoiler.

2	The two exhausts sticking out give some details to the back.

2	I absolutely disagree with all the negativity surrounding this car.

2	Maybe it's one of those models which needs to grow on you.

2	FINISHED MODEL Here it is, the finished model.

2	I know some of you don't like the looks of the car, but I think it looks great.

2	The color scheme is outstanding.

2	The new (for Technic) bright green parts, combined with white and black make this car look very vibrant and colorful.

2	I am not a big fan of the green used in the 42008 - Service Truck, but I do like this bright green a lot.

2	It fits perfectly well with the Mindstorms EV3 set.

2	The curves on the side of the car are not as smooth as some of us hoped, but I still think the car looks more than acceptable from the side.

2	The stickers add some nice details to the car, giving it that characteristic race car look.

2	The model looks great in pictures, but it does even look better in real life.

2	I love this picture of the front of the car.

2	However, I do wonder if a dedicated 24 hour Le Mans Racer has the seat and steering positioned off-center?!

2	Using the good ol' Google Machine I come to the conclusion that they do have centered seating and steering, at least the majority of them.

2	There's ample space in the cabin, which makes me wonder why TLG decided to place the seat off-centered.

2	The rear view looks cool too, with some of the suspension showing and the two exhaust pipes clearly visible.

2	The bottom view is very useful to determine the size of the car in studs.

2	It measures approx 59 x 27 studs.

2	The chassis looks organized and well designed.

2	The engine has been placed close to the ground, which is perfect for the weight distribution.

2	A low center of gravity improves the handling of the car.

2	I really enjoyed building this baby.

2	The build is very clean and organized, although there are some steps where you need to bend the beams a bit to get things into place.

2	Seeing the model come to life and seeing it grow to pretty impressive proportions is very satisfying.

2	For me it was fun, but I reckon kids will go nuts over this set and the build.

2	SIZE COMPARISON What became obvious during the build, but what's emphasized when you have finished the model, is that it's quite big!

2	The size of the car is pretty impressive.

2	The pictures below show the car next to the 42030 - Volvo L350F.

2	The side view emphasizes the size of the car.

2	It's even longer than the Volvo, if you dismiss the bucket.

2	PARTS LEFT Some parts left.

2	Nothing out of the ordinary.

2	FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS Unlike the B-model, this model doesn't implement any unexpected features.

2	The functions it does implement are exactly what you would expect from any car.

2	Steering (HoG) Working fake engine Suspension Opening doors (gullwing style) Opening bonnet/hood Opening trunk Gearbox for switching between functions Unfortunately the steering wheel hasn't been linked to the HoG (Hand of God) steering mechanism.

2	Placing the seat in the center would have provided an easy way to link the steering wheel to the steering mechanism.

2	it's a shame we hardly see actual steering anymore.

2	Opening the hood actually opens up the entire rear section of the car, providing you with easy access to the motor compartment.

2	The mechanism to open the hood works properly, which results in smooth opening and closing of it.

2	The same goes for the gullwing style doors.

2	Both functions are operated manually and you need to switch with the lever to the left of the cockpit.

2	These two functions are also the ones which can be motorized by placing an M-motor near the cockpit and a battery box in the trunk.

2	All things considered I think this car offers lots of playability.

2	The model is solidly built and the functions are easy to operate.

2	I'd say it's pretty safe to let your kids play with it.

2	B-MODEL Unlike the A-model, the B-model for this set received (almost) universal acclaim, and I can see why.

2	Often the B-model is a pale shadow of it's part donor.

2	In this case the model looks so good, it could be a model of it's own.

2	It even incorporates a neat feature, which actually deserves to be in the A-model.

2	There's a lot a variation in the quality of digital building instructions TLG is providing, but these ones are of very high quality.

2	The picture below shows most of the chassis with suspension, fake engine and gearbox in place.

2	FINISHED MODEL Some concessions have been made, but overall the car looks fantastic.

2	The black of the roof has been extrapolated from the hood, which definitely works for me.

2	The rear section of the car feels a bit empty, but the panels do cover up most of it, so it's hardly noticeable.

2	The V8 stickers will be upside down if you use the parts from the A-model.

2	Since I could apply new stickers, I have placed them using the proper orientation.

2	The bottom of the car shows the chassis.

2	It's obviously a bit smaller than the A-model's chassis.

2	FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS Taking the functions into account, this model isn't playing second fiddle to the A-model.

2	Besides the obvious functions like steering, opening doors and hood, this car features folding fog lights, which deserve a better podium than a B-model.

2	Steering (Hog) Working fake engine Suspension Opening doors (manually) Opening hood/bonnet (manually) Opening trunk (operated by gear) Folding fog lights (operated by gear) Gearbox (used to switch functions) FOG LIGHTS One of the most interesting features of the B-model are the folding Fog Lights.

2	It almost feels a bit weird that a feature like this is implemented in the B-model, instead of the A-model.

2	Below are 4 steps showing how the mechanism works.

2	I have also included a video.

2	The mechanism is somewhat reminiscent of fork mechanism used in the 8109 - Flatbed Truck, which has been described in Efferman's Review.

2	Take a look at the video to the fog lights in action.

2	PARTS LEFT A fair number of parts left, which isn't uncommon for a B-model.

2	SUMMARY To summarize how I feel about this set, you need to take a look at the picture below.

2	The combined image reflects the quality of this set....or better yet....sets!

2	You actually get two great models, for the price of one.

2	You don't like the A-model?

2	No problem, you can have lots of fun with the B-model.

2	I can't stop playing with the fog lights, it's mesmarizing.

2	The color scheme on both models is outstanding.

2	I simply can't emphasize enough how well this color scheme pleases the eye.

2	The regular green is dull and boring, but this bright green really pops out, especially when combined with black and white, and possibly some red details.

2	Black, white and a little red?!

2	Sounds familiar?

2	Yes, bright green can easily be combined with your EV3 robots.

2	So while you are combining the bright green with your robot, why not use the great new curved "mudguard" panels.

2	These new panels are introduced in this set and they look great.

2	They open up a lot of possibilities in the design department.

2	The build of the A-model is outstanding.

2	It is fairly simple, but since it's so clean, I really enjoyed it a lot.

2	I think the build should be entertaining, which doesn't mean it needs to be a real challenge.

2	And let's be honest; when is a build really challenging?!

2	The rear suspension is a good example of why I liked the build.

2	It's very simple, yet very effective.

2	Works like a charm.

2	The same goes for the other functions in both models.

2	And the star of the entire show can be found in the B-model.

2	How's that for a surprise?!

2	Being aware of the fact that I like this model a lot better than most of you seem to do, I really encourage you to give this model a chance.

2	The sheer size is impressive, the color scheme is awesome and you get a bonus model, which is actually worth building.

2	SCORE Okay, so how do I grade this set?

2	8 DESIGN Open to debate, but I like it a lot.

2	8 BUILDING EXPERIENCE Fun and clean build.

2	9 FEATURES Superb function in B-model steels the show.

2	9 PLAYABILITY Both models offer lots of playability 8 PARTS Lots of new parts and cool existing parts.

2	10 VALUE FOR MONEY Two models for the price of one.

2	8,7 TWICE THE FUN I hope you enjoyed this review!

2	More pictures can be found on my Flickr page.

3	Outstanding review Jim, congrats !

3	Love the pictures, so clean and crisp .

3	Hope to see many more of your reviews.

3	As for the set, after seeing this review I kind of like it, if I will find it at a decent price, I will get it for sure.

3	Jim, great review as always.

3	You convinced me to get this one of these days, although not a to priority.

3	Any comments on which functions can be converted to PF and how well they work?

3	Any comments on which functions can be converted to PF and how well they work?

3	Actually yes!

3	I am in the midst of making a PF version.

3	I will post a picture of the setup I have so far.

3	This setup is for driving the chassis and it works pretty fine!

3	Thanks for a great review.

3	I've got a pile of TRU and Lego credit I wanna spend and was thinking about getting this (since I got a sneak peak of your review in the Academy) but it's not here in the US yet.

3	Too bad.

3	Wonder when it'll hit?

3	I do disagree about the manuals though.

3	I find the thinner, stapled manuals easier to use than single large square-bound ones since they lay flatter when open.

3	Have any links to the prelim photos of the front end?

3	I don't remember seeing that and was curious how different it looked.

2	Well, you certainly have a point.

2	Can't argue with that.

2	I don't remember seeing that and was curious how different it looked.

2	i must have it somewhere.

3	Great review,I am still undecided whether to get this set or not.

3	Really thorough review, Jim.

3	I am super jealous that you have 2 of these and I have none, with no opportunity to get one any time soon.

3	Great review.

3	I see now why the B model is so popular.

3	I wonder though, on the car, if instead of the panels for the rear spolier (or wing) if they could have used studded panels and maybe layer them to give the appearance of, ie: a three element rear wing.

3	I won't mention the front lights.

3	If I had the money I would buy it for the B model.

3	H

3	Great review Jim and stunning pictures

3	I think this set will be my next purchase.

3	I love the color scheme and indeed it looks like a nice set.

3	Also 1200 parts for EUR 100 is not a bad deal.

3	And yes, the looks of the car have really grown on my since the first official pictures appeared.

3	I'm curious how the bright green will work combined with other colors than white.

3	I really hope more sets in the future will use the color (so that more different parts will be available over time).

3	I think I'm the only person on Eurobricks who doesn't like the looks of the B model, but I appreciate the extra functionality it offers.

3	Besides the set itself, I think this is one of the best reviews I have read in a while.

3	Great job on the superb photographs (which I think are essential to a review) and the extensiveness of it all.

3	You really touched every subject, which is great :D

2	I think I read somewhere that the US will not get this set or the motorcycle until August 2015.

2	That means the flagship most likely won't be in August but even later in the year... nothing Bricklink can't solve though.

3	Fantastic review Jim, from the quality of the review alone it is easy to see how much hard work you have put into it.

3	I'm with you on the instruction manual, I much prefer one quality bound book over umpteen stapled booklets.

3	Already have 2 of these sitting in the build queue, one for display model as I'm a fan of this one and one to build the B model then dissemble for parts, so I'm already sold on his set but still very much enjoyed taking the time it deserves to read through the review and ogle at your pro photography.

3	Great review with fantastic pictures.

3	As for the model, I'm glad that they chose to make it less pretty - real Le Mans prototypes are rarely a sight to behold.

3	It is function and aerodynamics over form.

3	I would, however, have preferred more realism for the sake of learning: - The front shouldn't open like that - instead it should be easy to remove the whole front cover, leaving the suspension easy to work on.

3	- The aero seems to be realistic, except for the rear end where there's no indication of a venturi channel.

3	This should have been easy to include.

3	- There is no fuel tank, nor fixed fuel connector right behind the cabin.

3	- There are no air jacks!

3	Seriously!?

3	This is one of the most unique features of a race car like this... and LEGO forgot about them.

3	Instead they automated two functions which are manual on a real race car.

3	- The top cars at Le Mans are hybrids with ingenious systems.

3	I would have loved to see the front wheels connected to some kind of spinning apparatus indicating a kinetic energy recovery system.

3	If I get this set...

3	I'm going to make some modifications.

3	This is a mega review.

3	You've taken the right pictures and the video demonstrations of the mechanisms really help get the good points of the set across.

3	What's more amazing is that the review still feels very concise and to the point.

3	You've actually convinced me to put this set on my list and not just as a decent parts pack.

3	I'm not sure air jacks are the feature that will have people fawning over this set, and pneumatics are being covered rather well later in the year ... but I agree with everything else, most notably removable front and rear bodywork (the removable engine cover on 8674 would be a good starting point here) and the inclusion of some nod towards a hybrid system.

3	It's also worth remembering the preliminary design did have the Big Honking Fin (BHF) that is mandatory on all current prototypes, so maybe when that was removed any trace of a tunnel or diffuser went with it.

3	On the subject of steering wheels, all modern prototypes actually have left or right hand drive.

3	The regulations demand that both LMP1 and LMP2 cars are nominally capable of seating two people.

3	Of course in practise the "extra seat" is taken up by the hybrid system in LMP1 and electronics/extra cockpit access in LMP2.

3	However this doesn't change the fact that it would be easy to link the steering wheel to the HoG/front axle.

3	Edited by Jay Psi, 12 March 2015 - 09:55 PM.

3	I was very skeptical of this set because I really thought the redesign degraded the looks of the A-model a lot, but after building it I must say this is an excellent set.

3	Good job TLG!

3	I'm still not a huge fan of the model, but this is one awesome review.

3	The effort and quality can be clearly seen and I hope you continue making reviews like this

3	Ted, have you described your photography setup somewhere?

3	I love the crisp quality of your pictures.

3	Great review.

3	I think it look like a great set, both A and B.

3	However the panels are the only thing I would need, but still a great looking set.

3	Great review Jim..

3	I have been sitting on the fence about if I will get this set for a while but I saw one built for the first time at a local brick show on the weekend.

3	It definitely looks better in real life than any pics.

3	I have decided to buy one

3	A very professional review and really no stone unturned.

3	But I'm still not going to rush out and buy a copy

2	Awesome review Jim!

2	I love the pictures.

2	I don't like how LEGO did this model though.

2	Too many compromises Edited by Omikron, 13 March 2015 - 07:24 AM.

3	A great review Jim.

3	Just finished building this set.

3	A couple of steps required abit of lego stressing to get together when there was an easier way.

3	Just made it into RC ( almost finished it in LDD) which was easy to do as it has so much room for nearly any configuration of motors and not have them showing.

3	A great set.

2	Wonderful review, but I am still not sold on the set.

2	If we get more sets with the bright green I might be tempted to get it, but until then it is too few parts in bright green (too few different types, not the number of pieces) to be able to use that colour effectively in making MOC's.

3	True, but I must say I like the new colour, very 'fresh' looking compared to the rather dullish regular green.

3	Can't wait to build MOCs with it.

3	I have been waiting for this set since the pictures for the toy fairs eirlier in the year and I am glad to say I am not disapointed.

3	First the price it is not cheap at ?99.99 but I guess that is typical for a set with this amount of electronics in it.There is no parts count and I have not had time to add up the 2 pages of contents to get a figure.

3	First the box standard flip top with large internal picture and rip to open lid.

3	inside There are no numbered bags in this set which I prefer I like to open all the bags and put all the parts in the box before building.

3	Next is a picture on the electronics 2 XLmotors as lego describe them and 2 standard motors.

3	2 IR receivers and 1 IR transmitter I know these have been discussed before but I really like the thought that has gone into the transmitters/receivers each receiver has 2 outputs to corespond with the 2 controls on transmitter they also have a choice of 4 channels so one transmitter can control up to 8 independant motors by changing the channel switch.

3	The transmitter also has a neat motor direction switch so you can configure the transmitter operation.

3	The set comes with three manuals 1 is the main drive mechanism 2 is the cab and engine and 3 is the attachments front and back.

3	There is also the now standard parts list in the back of the third manual.

3	There is no alternative model instructions despite the pictures of one on the box however there is a reference to the technic website on the back of the box but at the moment the page only has an advert saying the set is to be released on 1st September so I guess I will have to wait untill then to see if the instructions will be online.

3	The build is fairly straight forward the main chassis is studless, the next picture shows the motors mounted into the chassis and the drive for the shovel and claw.

3	It also shows the V6 technic engine.

3	This next picture shows the IR receivers mounted on the back.

3	The battery box slots into the back and can be easily slid out with the removal of two pins which is useful because I can imagine I will need to change the batteries on a regular basis.

3	The next 2 picture are of the completed model Overall I was very happy with the finished dozer the functions work really well and as I have the monster dino I have used a second transmitter so I dont have to touch the channel switch, I have included some video On my Brickshelf page.

3	Unfortunately this set does suffer from some quality issues for example moulding marks on the plates, colour diferences, some of the pins not finished properly, some pins were very stiff and quite hard to push into the holes but the worst issue was an axle that would not turn freely in a hole which just adds extra friction into the system.

3	I am glad to see some studded technic in this set I much prefer sets that use both varieties of technic beam.

3	There are only 2 Fairings which is a great improvment over recent sets if TLC had tried to make the bulldozer shovel with fairings this would have been a complete disaster.

3	Marks for the set 8/10 for price with the number of motors I expected it to be greater.

3	9/10 for fun my kids love this type of set that does something when finished.

3	6/10 for quality TLC really need to work on this one.

3	8/10 overall I would definately get a second one if I see it in the sales.

3	Feel free to post questions but I will be on holiday next week.

3	More pics and Videos available HERE

3	Thank you vey much for this review.

3	I do have some questions; 1.

3	What are the white clutches geared into?

3	2.

3	Is the engine geared to one or both drive motors?

3	3.

3	How well does it go on carpet?

3	4.

3	Can it doze without breaking the blade?

2	It works fine on our rugs but we have mainly wood floors.

2	Not sure if is fairly strong I have only chased the cat at the moment :'-(

3	Excellent review, thanks!

3	What is the cost in US?

3	Not released in my area.

3	The shovel is obviously my favorite area, it looks detailed and strong.

3	I love the treads, because I need them to move the 4 x 4 barrels on my super-scaled turbolaser turret.

3	Very good pics too.

3	What color are the treads?

3	I never had them.

3	They are plastic or rubber?

2	Ah man...I wanted to review it with mine.

2	Oh well.

2	Here in the U.S. it cost $150 and has 1355 pieces total.

2	The pins and axles did seem a bit difficult in putting them into place.

2	A problem I have been having is the batterys are done after about 4 hours of play, which I really wish they would last longer :-( .

2	Overall it is a stupendous set and it is really nice to see our old friend the studs make a return!

3	Where??

3	I'm really liking this set!

3	Its looking better now that i'm seeing more of it at differnt angles.

3	I'mvery curious how wellit pulls, and and can push/doze before the clutches start slipping.

2	Thanks for the review, it really looks cool.

2	Too bad it's soo expensive.

2	:-/ I must admit that I prefer the 8421 mobile crane for more or less the same price, the design is more "sexy".

2	*wub*

3	Thanks for the great review of this set.

3	I've been looking forward to it as well and I am excited about the wireless controls like the Dino.

3	I too am curious if this set has been released here in the US.

3	I was told that it was a Sept 1 release.

3	I agree about the battery life.

3	My Dino set lasted about 4 hours too.

3	Thanks for the review!

3	This looks like a great set, and with four motors, two receivers and a remote control I wouldn't say it is overpriced.

3	It is still a lot of money though.....

3	If my scholarship permits it I will seriously consider buying this set.

3	I can't wait to get my paws on this dozer!

3	:-$ The new motors look very interesting and I It will be fun to see which possibilities they have in any future MOC:s.

3	Thank you very much for that neat review, Ickelpete!

3	*y* Your pictures?re very interesting and your video?s really good.

3	That set looks very beautiful to me, a formidable new Technic set that quickly?ll turn into an everlasting classic for sure.

3	:'-) I?m just a little sorry for those quality problems.... Well, I hope that TLC?ll work on that matter and fix it soon.

3	The clutches are only for the shovel and claw on the front and back the tracks are driven directly from the XL motors and first impressions are good they seem quite powerful it will climb over a small cusion quite easily.

3	Nice review, Ickelpete.

3	Thank you.

3	Ickel, thanks for that awesome review.

3	It makes me want to buy this set.

3	I think it'd go just swell with the Mobile Crane.

3	The fact that it has all the motors and such is awesome, I can foresee using those for a lot of other functions for MOCs.

3	And, well I'm a fan of treads.

3	You can never have enough treads :-D Hm, would you be able to tell us, perhaps after a test or two what kind of weight this beast can push around?

3	Thank you!

3	Hi, many thanks for this review, photos and videos.

3	I can't wait to put the hands on mine, since it is already ordered and should arrive before the end of the month.

3	:'-) Could you post a scan or photos, from those last pages in the Building Instructions where the parts included are listed?

3	Thanks Edited by Conchas, 04 August 2007 - 07:19 PM.

2	*sing* I just noticed that he has done that in Brick journal 8.

2	Check out page 56-61 for great info and a comparison to the gear motors.

2	To bad it didn't include the NXT-motors since they are very similar.

3	Thank you Ickelpete for that great review.

3	I give you two *y* up.

3	I am not a technic fan, but this set definitly looks *sweet* .

3	I see great potential using this set as a model for a smaller dozer for my town/train layout.

3	I really *wub* the crawler tracks they used.

3	I have been thinking about buying the snowmobile for the tracks.

3	But if possible, I just might buy this set instead.

3	I could definitly use the other parts for MOC's.

3	Model On!

2	When i read this i first though you meant set number but this model can't be found there yet and now i realize that you mean something completly different.

2	What is this code you're after?

2	What is this code you're after?

2	There is a additional code in the booklet (different for every one) you should find it from the front or back cover.

2	Also later editions have different codes.

2	Some examples: Set 7905 - 4497674 (Front Cover, Bottom Left) Set 8421 - 4284910 (Book 1) and 4284922 (Book 2) (Back Cover, Bottom Right) I'll bet the code is then used to "abuse" the Lego cache :-) Mig

3	The new small Technic sets have incredible functionality for their size, and this one is no exception.

3	With only 106 parts this crane can roll, extend, rotate, lift (and hold in any position) and has working stabilisers!

3	The boom extends the same as the other sets with this boom; simply pull it.

3	It works surprisingly well and due to circular ridges inside the boom the extension (which is just a standard beam) will hold in place.

3	The gear at the back controls the height of the boom.

3	As you can see the boom is only half extended.

3	Boom fully extended, half down.

3	The cable is kept in place via two gears and a blue pin, same as the 7905 crane.

3	Even under decent weights this works well.

3	The stabilisers however cannot handle much weight once the load is moved off axis.

3	The stablilsers are a very simple but effective design.

3	Another shot of the stablilsers.

3	This also shows how far the boom will decend.

3	The boom height mechanism works well also.

3	I love the cab design.

3	Overall this is a remarkable achievement for the low price.

3	I bought it for the boom piece as I want to improve the crane that came with 7998 7898 ( :-$ ).

3	I highly recommend it.

1	Very nice review Sinner!

1	*y* *wub* So we are getting more and more reviews with figs in it, that?s great!

1	:'-) I actually wanted to skip this technic set, but your review made me think again.

1	I haven?t seen you posting a price, so I will do that for you :-P : It?s (just) 9,99?

1	in Germany.

3	Really awesome review!

3	I didn't think this set could be that great, but it looks very nice and seems quite cheap.

3	*wub*

3	A very nice review of a very good little set, thanks Sinner!

3	*y*

3	Excellent set, excellent review.

3	I'll be picking up this set for sure.

3	Probbly a few just for the parts.

3	But one question.

3	What Crane are you refering to that came with 7998?

3	That is the new heavy loader, and it didn't come with an any crane> 8-?

3	Sorry.

3	My mistake.

3	I meant 7898. :-$

3	Alright, so I usually do quick photo reviews when I get new sets.

3	That's what I'll do here, but there's quite a few photos, so I thought I might as well make its own review thread.

3	So, I got the Kwik-E-Mart by paying just2much on an early eBay copy.

3	I think it's worth it, as this week I'm gonna be super busy, so I was able to build it Saturday and stuff.

3	Here's my video review, I think it's one of my best: Well, let's get onto this photo review.

3	The set is $200 USD with a little over 2100 pieces.

3	The official release is April 15th for VIP members, May 1st for everyone else at LEGO Stores.

3	And, if you want full size pictures, check out my Flickr by clicking here.

3	The minifigures included are great.

3	You get three exclusive minifigures (one being a completely exclusive character- the first time LEGO has ever put an exclusive mould in a Direct to Consumer set), and you get three of the series most popular characters in their normal attire for those who missed out on the first Simpsons minifigures series.

3	The Kwik-E-Mart's exterior is loaded with lots of sticker details.

3	The only printed detail you'll see in the exterior is the dial pad in the phone booth, which has appeared in some other licensed themes since last year.

3	( ^^^ right here is there the store can be opened- a simple Technic pin and receiver keeps it in place and allows for opening and closing) The roof of the store includes the garden shown in the Paul McCartney episode.

3	The roof can be slided out/in once you open it with the hinge part.

3	Here's a look at the store with the roof removed.

3	The floors are a nice sand blue color, coming with 8x16 thin plates: And, for the interior, from the view of the store opened with the hinges at the back that I mentioned earlier: The left front corner, which includes some arcade machines of Bonestorm and Great White Hunter, an amazingly done Buzz cola soda machine, juice machine, the checkout counter, ect: The right front corner, with food aisles, freezers, and a frozen Jasper sticker: The back left corner, which includes some nice coffee kettle builds, the donut tray, hotdogs, ect: The right back corner, which has a door leading to a very small hallway that only has a mouse and cheese in it.

3	The hallway leads to the employees only door in the back, and it's very hard to get in the door way (not that there's anything to do inside there): Also included is Clancy's copcar, which fits three figures: Here's a look at the piece list in the instructions, click on each to be lead to an enlarged version of the pic: Also included are some awesome printed pieces, and two unprinted coffee cups!

3	Honestly, I think this set is perfect.

3	The price is fantastic, and has a great PPP ratio.

3	They really went above and beyond by including Snake in this set.

3	I honestly think it's better than the Simpsons House in terms of accuracy and the value here- so many cool pieces printed and in exclusive colors.

3	So, that's my quick picture review.

3	Hope you guys enjoyed, and I'd love to hear your thoughts!

3	Thanks 'j2g' for another review, one of my favourite parts of the set......the half eaten donut on the dashboard of the police car.

3	Brick On Review On 'j2g' !

3	Thanks for the review, your video was very well done, seeing those sticker sheets is daunting.

3	Thanks for the review.

3	I can't help but think the minifigures are the weak part of the set.

3	Snake and Apu are great but the rest....

3	I don't know.

3	They kinda redundant now.

3	They could at least give us new torso printing, like Homer wearing his jacket or Bart wearing his blue t-shirt or Marge wearing her coat.

3	Or, as I said in the discussion thread, I'd have included Jasper in CMF series 2 and a Frozen version here.

3	Overall, the set looks kinda smaller than what I thought.

3	(Snake's bag needed a $ symbol printed, because it looks like he is stealing gargabe ) Pretty good review overall

1	Thanks for all the feedback you guys!

1	I agree, but so many people were complaining about how The Simpsons House should have included the most common versions (mostly because the eyes or whatever), so I think LEGO played it safe and just included the normal versions.

1	It makes sense, since Series 1 is gone forever, and the common versions were in there, and this set is bound to be in stock for a very long time like the Death Star.

1	I never really agreed when people were complaining about the alternate eye prints personally, but I guess this is a good business choice based on previous feedback.

3	Hello everyone.

3	Excellent review!

3	English is not my native language, but I want to express my opinion.

3	Simpsons house was the first of its kind, and I can say without exaggeration that this is the most impressive set that I'm going (my collection http://brickset.com/sets/ownedby-celeb ).

3	I look at the video from the Kwik-e-Mart, and is difficult to say how good it is compared with the house.

3	The main disadvantages that I said to myself, is this: build the walls of the large panels, next is access to the roof (gray parts in front of the back door (I think they represent the stairs)) is not on the level with doors on the roof and when you open them, you can see the white block is openly trash, my points of view.

3	Boxes on the left of go to the store and powersauce box, i want see make real and not just a cube, f.e.

3	such as in the unreleased Star Wars set.

3	About minifigures, I fully agree with Robert8.

3	Two more of the same Homer, Marge and Bart?!

3	Personally, I put my set as a scene and all the replays minifigure are inside the house that was not identical characters next And also absolutely terrible Bart`s accessory This set is made parking for bikes and it looks very cool.

3	But damn, it is hoped to see the Bart or Lisa's bike, instead of useless balloons with paint.

3	The walls are made with convex inside panels, why so?

3	can anyone know?

3	have not seen any pictures with such walls in TV show.

3	Why did not they turn?

3	I personally really like how realized roof, but my brother says that it is terrible :) garden could do more in the series there were almost jungle I do not know how to be considered here, maybe anyone can express any opinion or idea?

3	I look at the Simpsons house, and then look at the photo of this e-Mart.

3	I can not understand, in the house we have a garage, two floors, cool floor, a lot of furniture, all the rooms and walls, collected from cubes, many additional accessories.

3	And where is all this detail here?

3	It looks much smaller (maybe even poorer).

3	If they still will release next year comic book store, it will be even less?

3	Of course it is difficult to estimate without seeing it live, we have it will be sold only in May.

3	At first sight it does not look so impressive as the house.

3	Can certainly the case in the limit on the amount of detail, but why it was impossible to add $ 50 to the cost and make Jasper, the more detailed the roof, the walls of the smaller elements, that it was not convex.

3	Sad.

3	Thanks all for attention.

3	You must be a youngin'...those phone booths thingys are called "pay phones" :) J/J They're tough to find nowadays.

3	LOL!

1	I have sooo mixed feeling about that...

1	I loved the Simpsons House (save for the terrible wall in the Homer and Marge's room), but this so far is inferior in almost every aspect.

1	The walls made of panels is a bummer.

1	I expect a D2C set to be better that this.

1	60+ stickers?

1	The same thing.

1	Same price for less bricks and smaller build then the house.

1	Strange coloured bricks on the outside wall (some ugly mix of yellow + tan) Panels again with their fronts facing towards the inside of the shop so we and up with those squares all around.

1	The walls are yellow, this was so nice, lost opportunity to make it in some other less common colour.

1	Then again the set overall looks is good.

1	The roof is a nice detail.

1	The shop looks actually like a real one, not just an approximation of one.

1	The roof tiles are in Dark Orange - we got new/rare colour here The car looks interesting to build (just like the pink one from the house) Lots of nice references to the show It's The Simpsons!

1	Definitely a must buy... but for a discounted price.

1	I'll try to find one with maybe damaged box or after-display copy.

3	I loved the Simpsons House (save for the terrible wall in the Homer and Marge's room), but this so far is inferior in almost every aspect.

3	The walls made of panels is a bummer.

3	I expect a D2C set to be better that this.

3	60+ stickers?

3	The same thing.

3	Same price for less bricks and smaller build then the house.

3	Strange coloured bricks on the outside wall (some ugly mix of yellow + tan) Agreed!

3	Glad my GF likes to do stickers!

3	60 yikes!

3	But looking at it now I think the tan/yellow is supposed to represent where the paint is fading on the back of the store?

3	I guess?

3	Here's a size comp to the house: Click for a bigger image.

1	That's actually not bad sizing, IMO.

1	Sure, it looks like you get a lot more with the house, but the Kwik-E-Mart has a lot more of those little references that make it Simpsons.

1	I agree with some of the complaining; a real Jasper behind a trans-blue panel would have been cool.

1	You could always bulk up the roof with more foliage...

1	I think it has a great foundation as a set, but could do with a few mods to make it better.

1	Thanks for the pictures; I greatly appreciate being able to see reviews like this before dropping $200 on a LEGO set.

3	Great Review Just2Good, honestly I love this set lots of great details and references.

1	One thing that may justify the price: it has 527 different parts (if I counted correctly).

1	I alway heard the more different parts the more difficult the set is to produce.

1	The Simpsons House already had an astonishig amount of different pieces, but this one is even more extreme...

1	just2good, on 12 April 2015 - 10:29 PM, said: ... one being a completely exclusive character- the first time LEGO has ever put an exclusive mould in a Direct to Consumer set ...

1	I'm still hoping that Snake will be coming in the next (wave 3) CMF set.

1	It's the level of detail that floors me, a licensed set with the mindset of those great Creator sets.

1	I think it displays much better than the Simpsons house which, from the outside, is a bit drab

1	Nice review!

1	But I have one question: Is the transparent dome of the Squishee Drink removable?

3	Skalldyr, on 15 April 2015 - 10:53 PM, said: Nice review!

3	But I have one question: Is the transparent dome of the Squishee Drink removable?

3	Nopers.

3	I like this set a lot better than the Simpsons house, but 60+ stickers is just incredibly disappointing.

3	It seems quite a few of them could have been printed parts

3	Great review.

3	Nice review, I'm building it (need to finish it, but I'm at work right now) With the printed piece, you forgot to show the chocolat milk 1x1 brick, which is exclusive to this set yet (it isn't referenced on bricklink yet, only the blue one) The set is really fun to build, with a lot of little pieces for the fridges.

3	I haven't put the stickers yet, will see the final product to put the essentials ones

3	Did anyone else have a problem with the piano against the wall of The Simpsons House?

3	It just kept coming off way too easily and I was getting really frustrated with it sticking out and not fully going on so I had to put the two tiles that hold them one place over away from the wall for it to sit properly without falling out, I think I might put Snowball II behind it since cats love to hide underneath or behind things lol but just curious to know if anyone else was encountering this problem with the previous set.

1	I recently acquired 90% of this set, so I thought I would do a review of it.

1	Please note that half of the Mini-figs are wrong, and there are some part substitutions.

1	This is the only set that comes with this plate.

1	There is a depression under the grey plates to the back.

1	The pool depression can be easily covered by three quarter circle plates... which just happen to be included in this set.

1	(Good set design Lego!)

1	The stairs are old Fabuland ones, and have been used in a few other sets.

1	This is the only one that has them in "ParaPink" however.

1	What is the difference between "ParaPink" and "Pink"?

1	Dunno...

1	The big windows are in only two other sets, both of them DACTA ones!

1	The smaller ones were in one other Paradisa set.

1	The interior, while simple, works very well.

1	I love the coffee machine.

1	A cute car came with the set as well.

1	The bird house is a nice idea as well.

1	Once the current visitors leave I will probably be breaking this set.

1	I wish Lego would go back to these sets as they always had some great parts in them.

3	Great review of a classic set.

3	*y*

3	Nice review of a surprisingly interesting set.

3	*y* Those windows are great, and no doubt difficult to get.

3	Classic coffee maker, simple yet exactly right.

3	That baseplate was in a few other sets, but never with that pattern.

3	Would have made a great base for some of the classic 80s houses LEGO used to treat us to.

3	In tan was part of the Adventurers Egypt sets.

3	As recently as 2001 it was a base for Ogel.

3	Versatile plate that hopefully hasn't disappeared completely.

3	ParaPink is apparently "Light Pink" on Brickshelf, so I guess it's just lighter than normal pink (and stopped appearing in 1995.

3	Just so you know, that monkey is drinking too much and likely to fall in the pool ... ;-)

3	Indeed.

3	I wouldn't mind one of all!

3	Many of the raised plates are too raised (I think the new one in the Police station and the Hospital is) but I think this one is perfect.

3	imperialshadows, on Aug 13 2007, 07:29 PM, said: Just so you know, that monkey is drinking too much and likely to fall in the pool ... ;-) I believe he is hoping to take the barman with him.

3	X-D (He is one of Hinckleys characters on holiday...)

3	Tks Sinner for that cool review ;-) This set is not one of my favs (never was really a big fan of those raised baseplates) but had fantastic parts and MFs !!

3	It has great playability with really cool "80's Miami" feel *wub* That pink was actually pretty cool and went well with that lime green (I think its lime but I'm not 100% positive).

3	Once again this pisses me off so much that I was in my dark ages when this theme was out !!

3	I loved it, especially all the beach/water themes *wub* I really wish TLC decided to bring that water Paradisia back !!

3	Who knows !!

3	After all they need to make some girlie sets !!

3	Girls are a part of their market totally neglected !!

3	How many women we have on the boards ??

3	Really a tiny few unfortunatly !!

3	SO TLC, please bring Paradisia back in may 08 :-P , please !!

3	*yoda*

3	xwingyoda, on Aug 13 2007, 08:11 PM, said: Tks Sinner for that cool review ;-) My pleasure.

3	:-P This set has been on my want list for a long time because of the windows.

3	(We are almost the same age so it make sense!)

3	xwingyoda, on Aug 13 2007, 08:11 PM, said: I really wish TLC decided to bring that water Paradisia back !!

3	I wouldn't be surprised if they do.

3	I think there is a greater chance of a return to Paradisia like sets than Fabuland.

3	I also think TLC is missing the mark with Belville.

3	I got that set recently as well.

3	Bought a bulk lot and there was all but 1 minifig in there.

3	Gave it to my girlfriend for her town.

3	Need to find her a Ristorante now.

3	Nice review Sinner!

3	*y* My favorite part of this set is the parrot in the front window!

3	*wub*

3	Awesome set!

3	I really like the robots, and that tiny tank could be quite useful!

3	All the fancy machinery in there really make it more like a lab than a restaurant!

3	:-D The thing I found most funny was the positioning of the middle finger on the hand.

3	:-D :-D Definitely gave me quite a laugh.

3	X-D

1	phoinix, on Aug 15 2007, 12:58 AM, said: ok its time for me to make a conffesion.. i have never wathced this show in my life!!!

1	and im not a bit curious on what the fuss is about.. your review is super as always yoda but i really cant say anything about the set cause i dont know what it is about!

1	The same counts for me.

1	I have never seen a single show.

1	So I only can argue about the bricks as are.

1	I don?t like all the SB sets because of the inflationary use of stickers.

1	>:-( More to that see below.

1	There are some bricks that are really cool like the bun disk, but I won?t buy this set just for single bricks.

1	I do like the color selection because of the comic strip relation though.

1	copmike, on Aug 15 2007, 10:42 AM, said: On the stickers issue I so agree with you *yoda* - and I think it?s time to start a revolution >:-)!

1	We need to adress this thing bigtime thru the Ambassadors to LEGO!

1	And go 451 on thoso stickers!!!!

1	Yeah - revolution ON!

1	If someone cares for the tar I?ll bring in the feathers!

1	:-D But - what is 451 about?

1	8-| *y* Thank you *yoda* for your nice review.

1	*y* It will not change my attitude towards SB though.

1	:-P

2	Loooool, don't say that too loud though That's ok, master yoda, i've decided to totally ignore the posts from this member in the future... X-D as for the review, if it actually is a review and not a homage, cos you really have to be clear about that on these boards :-| , ... well... what can I say?

2	It's not a space set, is it... X-D it looks fine though... nothing too special...

3	copmike, on Aug 16 2007, 09:21 AM, said: Fahrenheit 451 *sweet*!

3	And I thought it would mean: 4 responsible members of TLC belong to area 51 :-| :-$ But the stickers are made of plastic, not paper... What is the temperature when plastic catches fire?

3	;-)

2	*yoda*

3	Due to a larger BL order in the U.S.

3	I couldn?t resist to add two Hopper Waggons to my train layout.

3	Here?s a review of this fantastic set.

3	The box.

3	Well, there?s nothing really special about it.

3	The open box with three polybags.

3	Note, that there are only three different colors used in that set (actually there are 4, but you can?t see the dark grey ones).

3	Great color composition by the way.

3	*wub* And - NO STICKERS !!!

3	- :-D Oooops - I opened the bags too fast.

3	Help me, I?m drowning!

3	*sing* Not following the instructions, I built the wheels first to get the larger pieces out of the way.

3	Keep on rolling.

3	This is the load of the hopper waggon.

3	11 round bricks altogether.

3	When I opened the set, I was curious if it was a new colored set or an old one.

3	Luckily enough it was an old one, with old dark grey.

3	I don?t know if TLC ever produced this set with bley.

3	From the following pic you can clearly see, that the set is an old one.

3	Look at these slope bricks.

3	See what I mean?

3	All bricks are looking exactly the same!

3	Buy a set today means get at least three different textures on the slopes and maybe even more shades of tan.

3	:-X >:-( I have said that in many other threads here and I?m saying it again: Back to the roots, Lego!

3	You were able to produce good quality.

3	Show us you can still do it!

3	*sad* But now to the building.

3	It?s a 6 x 24 train base plate you?re building on.

3	Did I say I liked the colors?

3	:-D This is the mechanism to unload the waggon.

3	Built in the waggon with open gates... ... and with closed ones.

3	Almost done.

3	This is the first time, I realized that minifigs actually can step on those ladders.

3	:-$ A short lift and the wheels are fixed.

3	This darn mechanism!

3	Wait, I?m coming with my monkey wrench!

3	>:-) Who opened that door again?

3	Do I have to do it all on my own?

3	:'-( Finally the work is done.

3	Now have a brake.

3	One shot from the front/back.

3	You can see the car is really huge!

3	8-?

3	I put it behind the red car of the 4512.

3	That sure looked very strange.

3	*wacko* The set fits a lot better to the other cars of the "My Own Train" theme than to the older ones.

3	The Score: Brick selection: 10/10 excellent color and brick selection (these were the days...) Playability: 9/10 great unloading mechanism Price/piece count ratio: 8/10 at peeron it says 20$, I got it for 39,95$ -> 30?/228 bricks.

3	Not really cheap, but worth every cent!

3	:-) Overall rating: 9/10 and a definity "must buy" for rolling stock lovers.

3	Sad enough it?s not available on S@H any more.

3	But there are still sets on BL and ebay.

3	That?s for now folks, thank you for reading.

3	I have some job to do...

3	Great review of a great set!

3	*wub* I look forward to more!

2	Great review.

2	Very funny with "little you" helping with the building.

2	I got the wagon myself, i really like it.

2	What more did you get?

2	*y* Lovelly review, great minifig aswell.

2	I don't think LEGO ever produced these with bley.

3	Nice review about a nice set (I like this wagon, but don't buy it, because of the size, compared to my other wagons...).

3	Poor minifig who had to build an entire set!

3	*wub* *wub* *wub* *wub* *wub* Holodoc, I seriously have some love for your review!!

3	You're in it and using a Fabuland wrench!!!

3	Such a clever review with a great sense of humor!

3	I really liked this train set and it adds so much to a train layout, especially when you buy multiples.

3	TLC is throwing away a potential gold mine by discontinuing this line.

3	:'-( It is also nice to see those beautiful consistent slopes in that picture.

3	It really is sad that TLC is letting quality slip.

3	They don't seem to be responding to the issue they way they did the bley/frown fiasco.

3	perhaps we AFOL need to make more of a stink!

3	To the embassy!!!

3	>:-( Again great job Holodoc and thanks for sharing *sweet* *y* What an excellent and fun review!

3	!

2	Thank you guys for your nice reply.

2	:'-) I have to add two pics of my freight train showing a bit more clearly what the size matter is about: This is what it looks like when you put the Hopper Waggon right behind the red car of 4512.

2	It looks a lot better without the red car!

2	I had a lot of fun with this review and I will add another one (look at the 2nd pic ;-) ) the next days.

2	Stay tuned!

2	I see your point.

2	It looks slightly out of place.. :-P

3	Great review.

3	I hope you mini-self is OK after all of that LEGO burying him :-D This is one of the great sets that LEGO has produced, since forever.

3	I think more sets like this should be manufactured *wub* - Poomie

3	Excellent review Doc - I?m glad you can get out of the holodec *y*!

3	I could see this done with other colors than blue also *sweet*!!

2	Photoshop?s your friend... *skull*

3	Great review!

3	I loved the pic of your sigfig buried under legos :-D It's too bad Lego did not continue to make more of this style of set.

3	Great review, *y* I have just bought my first 9V motor and you have convinced me, I will buy a least two of this set.

3	:-)

3	Yes my SpongeBob fans, its time for another review !!

3	Lets look at our Bikini Bottom map and head strait to meet Miss Puff at her Boating school.

3	She is waiting for us to give us a guided tour of her establishment ;-) Another bit of SB history: this set comes from the following episode: Boating School: SpongeBob fails his boating test for the 38th time (what a freaking retard lool).

3	He's so determined to get his license that Patrick decides to help him.

3	He implants a walkie-talkie inside SB?s head in order to cheat and tell him what to do.

3	You will say that I am biais but I really enjoy building this set and I really like the SB theme !!

3	Lets hope 2008 brings more of that cool spongieness !!

3	But I digress...

3	Here are general pics of the instruction booklet and the DSS (G there are loads of crappy stickers in that one also !!).

3	As you can see the set is divided in 3 polybags.

3	Shamelessly (but nonetheless wilfully hehe), I will disregard the third one which is that playability crap course !!

3	I would have reviewed it but since it involves stickers, I didn?t want to ruin the parts and without stickers it would look dull, plain and ugly (it does look crappy with so imagine without), so that review will not be 100% complete and I do apologise in advance.

3	But how many of you would have build that and keep it hehe Off :-P 1/ Mfs and extras I will start with the really cool Miss Puff *wub* (the fig mind you !!).

3	She looks a bit stressed !!

3	No wonder, that sponge menace will bring her to the hospital once again hehe.

3	As you can see, that MF comprises 3 parts: the small blue 1x1 round and the 2 major parts.

3	Yeay another great stupid looking SB.

3	I love those idiotic faces !!

3	3 different SB figs and 3 idiotic faces hehe.

3	You never can get enough of them !!

3	Here is just a regular Patrick.

3	Too bad Patrick doesn?t have different expressions !

3	The pull back boat car: nothing really to report (except the fact that I left it sticker free !!)

3	The only thing I built from the third polybag is that pretty cool ancker holding tower thingie !!

3	Looks great in a lighthouse set hehe.

3	Yes the roud tile bouey is printed !!

3	Its the same as in SB's bed in the Bikini Bottom set ;-) OK, its time for those two great buildings: the lighthouse and the school + pontoon !!

3	Before reviewing them individually, here is a general pic.

3	2/ The lighthouse One of the main reason to own that great set !!

3	Sure it suffers from accute stickeretite (sad but :-D ).

3	T worst is that door), but nonetheless a great and simple building !!

3	Great white/red colour scheme, and a really fantastic 2 turning lights !!

3	I really like the yellow top of the lighthouse, it adds to the comic atmosphere of that theme instead of having a more plain red/white only.

3	The rear has nothing really fancy, except tools to fix it in case of problems hehe.

3	The only thing I modified since I didn?t build the third polybag is that I got rid of the trechnic parts on the right of the lighthoue to replace them with regular ?logs?

3	All hail the tower King !!

3	:-D 3/ The school and pontoon I really like that little building and its great to see that once again TLC uses the amazing dark blue color !!

3	Its really a simple design but looks fantastic and can be used for many things in a town hehe I also really like the combination with those dark bluish grey slopes !!

3	The rear reveals the desk, stickers on the wall (d?oh !!)

3	and two clams serving as chairs (really like on the show).

3	Its really great to see that TLC stays really as close to the show as possible.

3	The pontoon again is simple yet really cool and effective.

3	And its really nice to have 2 lifesaving boueys.

3	The only thing I modified since I didn?t build the third polybag is that I got rid of the trechnic parts in front of the pontoon to replace them with regular ?logs?

3	On the overall, I think its really a great set !!

3	Apart from the crap stickers, I think TLC should have ditched (or simplified) the third playability polybag to lower the cost !!

3	Oh well, parts are always usefull (except those one part shitty palm trees !!).

3	So until my next review, I bid you farewell my Spongebob fans !!

3	And I really hope to see next year hehe Will SB get his driver?s license one day ?

3	For the sake of Bikini Bottom, lets hope not !!

3	No license ever On !!

3	*yoda*

3	That?s really a great and overall nice playset with a very cool Mrs.

3	Puff and a fine new Spongebob!

3	*sweet* The boating school?s indeed very nice with a beautiful color scheme, and so is the lighthouse....

3	I?m really tempted to buy a second set just to "complete" these buildings.... although it?s a little too expensive for doing so, and it wouldn?t even fit with the style of the other SB sets.

3	X-D Wet highway to the poor puffer fish?

3	privat hell on!

3	:-D

3	You've done it again.

3	*yoda* !

3	Great reveiw.

3	I really like this set, but in my opinon, $50 is steep considering I won't actually 'play' with it.

3	I mean, half of it is a track for peat sake!

3	Ill eventually get it for the Mrs.

3	Puff figure, though.

3	*y*

3	*yoda* comes through again!

3	I love this set... but it just costs too much for Australians so I will be giving it a miss.

3	:'-( It is a shame as it has clams in it... 8-|

3	I like this one better than the other one for parts and such, plus I'm generally a sucker for any different minifig, but yeah, that price is steep.

3	Great review though!

3	One more SB face - YEAH *wub*!

3	Being a lighthouse freak I really like it, the trans clear blue ones rocks *y*!

3	I?m getting it - period!

3	SB On copmike

3	Another great review, thanks *yoda*!

3	Man, those smooth slopes really look like crap when on a roof :-| That was the whole reason they had texture in the first place... |-/ I'll never liked those, they feel so cheap!

3	The new SB head is great, and can Mrs.

3	Puff's legs move?

3	I just ask since her feet are separate, and in figs where the legs can't move, they're usually one piece at the bottom to keep them from breaking off.

3	The set looks great, and seems to have a lot of playability

3	Nice review !!

3	I'm not a big fan of those Spongebob figs.

3	However this set has some very useful pieces.

3	This is actually the first time I took a decent look at a Spongebob set.

2	Yoda, I don't thank you for this review, and after the Chump Bucket review too!

2	Because I'm so exited to have them that since I ordered them from s@h, I come back home aftre the work the faster I can, with the hope to see a big box on my bed... and this, even if I know that it tooks more than 6-7 days to have my order...

2	This Mrs.

2	Puff figs is really really nice *wub* And this 3rd SB head too!

3	Man, that Sponge-bob head cracks me up!

3	Hilarity.This is a cool set, although I much prefer the Chum Bucket set.

3	I don't see what's wrong with the course, then again I can see why AFOLs wouldn't like it.

3	It's just playability really.

3	I like the breakable wall though.

3	The building is cool, a few modifications (i.e.

3	making it more realistic, real chairs for a start) and it would make a cool little wharf for your Lego town.

3	And to SW4J, Mrs Puff's legs are connected at the feet, if you look closely.

3	So, thanks for the great review, *yoda*!

3	Thank you *yoda* for strike 2!

3	It?s SB again.

3	|-/ Sticker Alarm!

3	:-X But this set is better than Chum Bucket.

3	There are far more interesting parts if you don?t like SB.

3	Especially the light house and the little hut with the wooden pontoon.

3	*y* And yet again another set with smooth slopes and rough ones... Too bad, too bad.

3	>:-( >:-( >:-( If I just knew the person who is responsible for that... >:-)

3	Nice review mate, the set look's great and a real must for all those SB fan's out there.

3	The whole set scream playability that's for sure, which is great because let's be honest their's gonna be alot of kid's and *yoda* out their playing with it :-P X-D ;-) .

3	Geezzzzz what is it with all those bloody stikers?

3	This set would be soooooo much better with printed piece's instead of those, still once your over that at least the rest is ok. Am i the only one who thinks Mrs Puff kinda look's like a kinder egg toy?

3	Their's nothing wrong with that mind you (yes i have a kinder problem X-D ) just seem's strange to me.

3	Maybe mrs Puff has a nice toy inside X-D I like this review.

3	The lighthouse part and the school are nice enough for other towns.

3	and the figs are nice, even mrs puffs 2 pieces you can't use for other things.

3	:-) Pity that it's 50 dollars/+/- 60 euro.

3	for half price I would think about it.

2	So really no matter!

2	lets beam Miss Puff out of reach asap !!

2	and prepare to retaliate with Clamu's pearl canon !!

2	Bring it on Trekie >:-) :-P *yoda*

2	Holodoc and Yoda, don't be so hard with, or I will call my stronger friend, you know this aqua-squirrel aka Sandy!

2	And Sandy can have fun with our doc, Texas style >:-) *yoda*

3	I might get this and convert it to a lighthouse and warehouse for a city Dock...looks nice.

3	WALL on!

3	Very nice review *yoda* !!

3	Though, I think you should review the "course" because it looks very interesting.

3	xwingyoda, on Aug 16 2007, 10:11 PM, said: Hey Patrick, I'm on your side :-D !!

3	*yoda* Oops, I read too quickly, so misuderstood!

3	:-$

2	It looks like a good set but I would rather get the neighborhood one.

3	The set, and the other Designer sets that came out with it (especially 4888) are incredibly well designed sets.

3	I wish Lego would go back to doing sets like these as I loved the multitude of instructions and ideas.

3	The last batch of Creator sets had zero ideas, even though I know several were made.

3	:'-( Anyway, less whining, more review.

3	The lion is the main model.

3	His mouth doesn't fully close, but it does open more.

3	The head works well from most angles.

3	I love the dark orange bricks; great for rust...

3	He is quite solid, but the joints take the weight well.

3	The neck goes side to side and rotates, but doesn't go up and down.

3	The body is built in two parts and pinned in the middle.

3	With what is left you can make what I think is a hyena, a silly plant MOC... ...and what I believe is a vulture.

3	There are also instructions for a few other models including a bat, boar and a snake... which I quite like.

3	He can be built at the same time as... ...this cute little lizard.

3	Overall this is a great set with an excellent blend of colours and pieces.

3	I wanted it for steampunk potentials.

3	*sweet* I hope you liked the review.

3	Till next time....

3	The lizard looks the best to me - put him in a town and you've got a monster terrorising the residents.

3	Dr. S.

3	Great review as always!

3	*y* LEGO is timeless, so there is no such thing as an old set.

3	I never build brick monsters/creatures, but this set had such a nice assortment of parts that I had to pick a couple up as they weren't clearancing out on Shop @ Home.

3	I absolutely love dark orange and tan, so it was an automatic win.

3	I love the use of "familiar characters" in the review, I can almost hear Hinckley screaming, "my megabloks!"

3	:-P You sort of look like you're planning some vulture stew though.

3	Might have to start a new challenge to determine a winner there.

3	Sinner and his Big Pot o' Doom VS Giant Vulture!

3	Only thing is, does everything horrify the Mrs?

3	She seems perpetually shocked and/or dismayed at the goings on here.

3	Now that I think about it, I can see why.

3	I'm occasionally shocked and/or dismayed 8-?

3	Brick Built Beasties On!

3	*y*

3	A very fine review of a very fine set, thanks Sinner.

3	*y* The variety of cool colors in that set?s just formidable.

3	One more beautiful Creator set indeed!

3	Roaarrrr on!

3	:'-)

2	Thank you for the nice review, Sinner!

2	I also bought this set but in combination with 4883 when it was on sale (50% - hurray!)

2	at S@H. I made a short review of 4883 but wasn?t really sure what to tell about 4884.

2	So I?m glad you did that for me.

2	:-D I have different feelings about this set.

2	On the one hand I love the lion.

2	He is really impressive (even my wife -not known for being Lego enthusiastic- asked me, if there were more animals of this kind).

2	The lion is - restricted - poseable and the colors used are fantastic.

2	*wub* 3 models can be built simultaneously - that?s great!

2	On the other hand I still don?t know what to do with these rotation joints.

2	*wacko* And the other models are somehow disappointing compared to the lion.

2	I seem to have missed the little lizard.

2	:-$ I put it on my "to do-list".

2	Like all the Creator sets: Great parts pack - but wait until they get on sale!

2	X-D For me - I had a lot more fun with 4883.

2	Indeed: Roarrrr ON!

2	;-)

3	A broken man, I seached stores over and over again for a good deal on that set, and I found it last week for $25 AUD ($60 List).

3	I hope she's not allergic for skeletons too.

3	:-P :-D By the way: Great review, You made a nice warm, soft place to sleep for Hinckley.

2	*wub* In particular, the vulture has several hinges, black wings, and the dark red pieces that I want loads of.

2	Sorry.

2	:-$

2	I was really kidding, of course you want to keep it.

2	Who wouldn't?

2	;-) I was going to buy it off of BL anyway.

3	LEGO 75915 Pteranodon Capture I'm glad to review this nice set; 75915 Pteranodon Capture Name: Pteranodon Capture Set Number: 75915 Pieces: 174 Price: $19.99 Minifigs: 2 Theme: Jurassic World Year of Release: 2015 Links: Box The front of the box has the Jurassic World logo along with the set number, piece count, etc.

3	Its a decent box size for a $20 set.

3	Here it is compared to a minifigure.

3	Here's the back of the box.

3	It shows all of the features from the set an ad for the video game.

3	The back also shows a small picture with a silhouette of the dinosaurs from the line, along with their set numbers.

3	Instruction Booklet The booklet shows the same thing as the front of the box, nothing more, nothing less.

3	Near the back of the booklet, there is a picture with all of the characters from the sets.

3	The other page shows all the dinosaurs with a mini box that shows the size comparisons.

3	The Minifigures The minifigures in this set are Simon Masrani and an ACU.

3	Both of them have excellent printing on the front and the back.

3	The gun is the same one from TLM that the SSP used.

3	Simon Masrani is the only one with a double sided face.

3	His second face shows a scared/worried exp<b></b>ression.

3	He has a zipped up jacket or jumpsuit with a shirt underneath.

3	The ACU trooper only has one face which is a scared/worried exp<b></b>ression.

3	I would have a scared exp<b></b>ression too if I was about to get eaten by a dinosaur.

3	He has great detail on his torso and legs.

3	Let's take a look at the vest.

3	The vest is the same mold from the SSP in TLM I think.

3	It has the letters ACU on the front too.

3	The back is nothing interesting.

3	Pteranodon The pteranodon has great printing too.

3	The colors match the ones that the pteranodons from the movie have.

3	The wings, mouth, and head are a rubbery type of plastic and are easily bendable.

3	It uses the same mold from the pteranodon in the 2012 Dino line.

3	Here's a comparison between the two.

3	Spare Parts The spare parts aren't many, just a few extras.

3	The Helicopter At first the helicopter was 'meh' when I first saw it on the box.

3	Now that I've built it, I've got to say that I really like it.

3	Its my favorite helicopter of all of the ones I've built.

3	Its sturdy and sleek.

3	It's not too bulky either.

3	The first play feature in this set is the net launcher.

3	It works pretty well, not one of my favorite features but it does what it's meant to do.

3	The other play feature is on the other side.

3	Its a stud shooter which can be used by a minifigure.

3	You can put it on their hand or you can leave it there and let someone operate it.

3	The shooter can fold up inside the helicopter as well.

3	There are stickers on both sides of the helicopter and they also have the Jurassic World logo with Dino marks.

3	Final Verdict Value: 9/10 - For $20 this set isn't that bad.

3	The parts count is a little low for a $20 set but the price is probably because of licensing.

3	Other than that, it's a great deal, I would've hoped for maybe some bait for the pteranodon but that can easily be fixed.

3	Design: 9/10 - I REALLY love the way this helicopter looks, it's sleekness and design is great.

3	The only flaw this has is the huge net launcher, it's too big in my opinion.

3	Minifigs: 10/10[/b] - The minifigures are extremely detailed and it even includes an exclusive minifigure.

3	Playability: 9/10 - There are many things you can do with this set.

3	The swoosh factor is great and so are the play features.

3	Parts: 10/10[/b] - They're useful parts and there isn't many huge specialized pieces in here either.

3	Overall: 9/10 - This set is great for fans of Jurassic World, it's also a nice parts pack.

3	There's one exclusive minifigure in here too which makes it even better.

3	Having a little fun with the set Hope you liked my first review here on Eurobricks!

3	Please leave any suggestions on what to improve, thanks!

3	Edited by TheLazyChicken, 02 May 2015 - 10:19 PM.

3	Thanks for the review!

3	I really like this set.

3	I love the ACU minifigures and the dinosaur is really nice.

3	I think the helicopter has great potential for a SHIELD helicopter.

3	Only suggestion is that some of your pictures are a little bit dark.

3	(Especially the box front one) But really good for your first review!

3	Thanks a lot!

1	I love the dinos in these sets but aside from that the builds IMO kind of suck just like the last Dino sets.

1	This just has a franchise connected to it.

1	And honestly I hope it does well enough to spark more Dino/Jurassic Park-World interest because I want to see MORE Dino "minifigures".

1	Maybe a Brontosaurus or something.

1	I will most likely be buying many of the Dinosaur minifigures here.

1	However I doubt I'll buy the actual sets or the genetically altered dinosaur (which can only work for Jurassic World).

1	This set is IMO average.

1	Love the dinosaur...

2	Nice review!

2	Although, that picture of the ad reminded me of how some of the things surrounding Jurassic World (Lego, that is) seems hastily put together.

2	Just look at that the minifig.

2	He is Star Lord's head and hair, Indiana Jones' torso with different arms, and City legs.

2	To me, that seems a bit weak, especially for a video game.

2	Oh yeah, I just noticed that

3	Yesterday I went to Toys 'r Us and bought the Dilophosaur Ambush.

3	Beside that the shop had a display of the JW polybags.

3	For €3,49 I picked up two of them.

3	Now here is my little review of this pretty nice set.

3	First some data: Line: Jurassic World Year: 2015 Pieces: 29 Price: €3,49 Packaging: Polybag Ok, lets start with the polybag itself.

3	It is a standard size and had plenty of room for all the parts.

3	The front depicts the whole set with a little hexagon on the right with a seperate picture of the dinosaur and its name.

3	In this case the Celophysis is called Gallimimus.

3	Weird choice Next is the instruction sheet.

3	It is a doublesided paper with every building step in clear sight.

3	The part selection is nice.

3	There are only a few but all of them are pretty usefull for all kind of builds.

3	There are two parts which stood-out.

3	Both are printed tiles.

3	The first one is the yellow/black warning tile in 1x4.

3	You can't have enough of that.

3	The second one is a 2x2 tile with the Jurassic World logo on it.

3	That's pure awesome.

3	The bigger sets seem to have only sticker for that, so this little set is a perfect way to get hold of this nice tile.

3	The leftovers.

3	Nothing special.

3	Here is the complete trap.

3	It is a basic build and functions pretty well.

3	In the end the parts are more interesting as the build so it will definitely end up as a parts-pack.

3	Now on to the star of this bag.

3	The Celophysis/Gallimimus.

3	I don't know why Lego decided to call this dinosaur mold any different, but I think it has to do with movie-connection and the will to not produce a new mold.

3	Nevermind, this figure is great and the colour is very bright and totally stood out.

3	Pretty beastie.

3	A comparison between the 2015 Gallimimus and the 2012 Celophysis.

3	The final set in all its glory.

3	Final verdict: It is a great little set.

3	The parts used a nice and usefull.

3	The printed tiles are the secret stars of this set and the dinosaur is fun two.

3	With a few packs of these you could easily build a Celophysis pack with lots of Jurassic World signs on their way.

3	Highly recommended.

2	nice little review!

2	now i definitely have to check if the toys r us in dortmund has it, too!

2	Edited by KCMatze, 03 May 2015 - 01:34 PM.

2	I'm pleased to see that this is available for purchase, at least in some parts of the world, rather than only being available with the JW game.

2	Nice review, I'll going to scope out whether Toys R Us in Sweden is carrying them, although I've never seen polybags in there before.

2	Nice review!

2	I really hope its avaliable for sale in the US.

2	Thank you, guys.

2	I'm glad you liked this review.

2	It's a nice little set.

2	Great review man, really well written and structured.

2	Hoping to go on a hunt and see if this is available in UK stores soon.

2	Nice I had to buy the JW Lego game to get mine.

2	Great review!

2	But Spoiler I didn't see or even hear mentioned a Galliminus or any sort of dino trap in the movie.

2	I wonder where this design came from!

3	Lego 31036 Creator Toy and Grocery Shop Thanks to EuroBricks for making this review possible!

3	For years, Lego has offered a house of some sort in the Creator line each year - with the standard Creator 3-in-1 instructions, that's given us a very wide variety of housing.

3	In 2014, they added a business option with their 31026 Bike Shop and Cafe set.

3	This continues into this year's Toy and Grocery Shop set.

3	These shops are smaller than the very detailed modular buildings, but that should help them fit in better with the other City sets, and this also lets them get into more kids' cities with their lower pricetag.

3	Name: Toy and Grocery Shop Set Number: 31036 Pieces: 466 Price: $39.99 Minifigs: 2 Theme: Creator Year of Release: 2015 Links: Bricklink Peeron Brickset The Box The front of the box shows the "A" version model out of the three, plus insets of the B and C versions.

3	I like the sorta-European looking backdrop; it goes well with the styling of the buildings.

3	Interestingly, the main model is shown opened up for play, while the two insets show those versions folded.

3	The Box Top On the top of the box, Lego helpfully shows that with 3 of these sets, you can make a whole street.

3	The Box Back On the back, you get to again see all three versions together, but this time, folded.

3	It's a little creepy though with those clones running around :) The Manuals Yep, three actual, printed manuals.

3	There's nothing indicating them as being A, B, and C models, but it's pretty obvious looking at the designs which is the "main" model and which are the alternates.

3	The Contents Bags of parts and two plates.

3	Nothing terribly exciting to see here....

3	The Minifigs Nothing new here, but two nice figs none-the-less.

3	Well, Bricklink does say that both figs are unique to this set, but there's not any new parts to them.

3	The closest thing to rare is the female head - it's only in this set, 2013's Dragon Mountain Castle set, a UK store grand opening set, and one of the 2014 Holiday freebie sets.

3	The faces aren't that unique, but I guess this exact combo of two faces on the head is.

3	I love the kid torso with the spaceman on it.

3	The Minifig Backs No back printing on anything here except for an alternate female face.

3	Sorry.

3	I do like that her two faces are so different though.

3	That's much better than when a head has a "scared" and a "more scared" face.

3	The "C" Build Enough with the basics; let's build.

3	I'm going to review them in the same order I built them, backwards.

3	Since you can tell immediately looking at the 3 designs that they're going to use different numbers of pieces and so forth, I figured I'd build the smallest first lest it seem like a letdown.

3	All three have some basic similarities - the two plates are hinged to give a building that opens for play.

3	They also do have interiors, which you can see starting to form here.

3	The "C" Build, Front It's a pretty quick build, so it's done already.

3	Here's the front of the building with it opened up.

3	Like this, it appears to be two separate stores, a newsstand and some sort of shop you can enter.

3	All the printed tiles help give the newsstand a detailed appearance, but I'm not sure why they've got a $100 bill lying on the ledge...

3	The "C" Build, Rear From the back side, the interiors are pretty plain.

3	The shop half has a plant in a jar and a weird chair, and the newsstand just has a register.

3	The "C" Build, Sides Here's the two sides of the folded building.

3	On the hinge side, there's a bunch of windows in a disjointed wall with random colors.

3	On the other, why did they put in a huge window when the set does include a trans-clear door that could have gone there?

3	And you get a small patch of plants, like so many sets seem to have these days.

3	The "C" Build, Extras That's a lot of leftovers there.

3	And not just little stuff - multiple doors, stairs, etc.

3	And unused sand green is always a little sad....

3	The "B" Build, 1 A pretty similar start, with the hinge and little garden and some tiles along the ground.

3	The "B" Build, 2 Now we see a big windowed wall, some details like lights, and how it has the usual alternate model "weird part usage" - like a 1x4 brick with side studs being used over the doorway, even though those side studs will not get used.

3	The "B" Build, Front The finished building gives us a nice little post office, with a letter-carrying bird on the roof.

3	Hope that's not their normal method of delivery!

3	Something about the colors just doesn't work for me though.

3	The combo of white / light grey / dark grey / black / sand green plus tan is just too much.

3	The tan window and door frames I don't like.

3	The "B" Build, Inside On the inside, things are weird.

3	The counter on the left is ok, but the light above the door (with a yellow clip?

3	ugly!)

3	is too big, and everything else over there by the door doesn't make much sense either.

3	The "B" Build, Sides I like the front side here, except the colors are still too much.

3	The bench, greenery, mailbox on the corner, and streetlight are all nice.

3	The boy is a little creepy though - binoculars in hand PLUS a telescope on the roof of the post office?

3	Why?

3	The hinge side shows more of the weird colors you get in the wall, but that's going to be hidden when the set is open.

3	Plus we even see that on big modulars at times, so it's not SO terrible.

3	The "B" Build, Leftovers Again, a lot of leftover parts.

3	It's obvious this was another alternate, but it'd be nice to see more of them used to make a bigger building.

3	But let's move on to the model that DOES use them all...

3	The "A" Build, 1 The first half starts like this.

3	Maybe it's just my bias, but it already feels like a more detailed build.

3	Bottles on the wall, the yellow and red awning over the window, etc.

3	The "A" Build, 2 The other half starts off with detailed work too.

3	I think that's a red vending machine.

3	The stairs are also VERY solidly built.

3	I also appreciate the effort to get that diagonal base where a door will be - it's such a nice touch to have sections of a building that aren't right angles.

3	The "A" Build, 3 Not too much has been added, but I wanted to showcase the tiny toys before they get hidden by a wall.

3	That robot and train are just fantastic little micro builds.

3	The "A" Build, 4 Things are coming together quickly.

3	The walls, windows, and doors get the first floor nearly done.

3	I'm still not big on the sand green and tan combo, but I do really like the red and yellow awnings.

3	The "A" Build, 5 It appears the shop owner lives upstairs, since we've got a bedroom forming here.

3	The bed is a little plain, but the table and lamp on the other half are great.

3	And my big fingers did not like putting all those railings on the balcony, with the telescope posts and tile tops.

3	Knocked quite a few off before I got them all done.

3	The "A" Build, Front And it's done.

3	All the details make this set really feel like a mini-modular.

3	The roofline has great greebling, and the shop contents, and on and on.

3	It's not perfect though.

3	The tiny car above the toy store door isn't nearly as good as the toys inside.

3	And the kid's yellow scooter?

3	The wheels aren't even on the ground, much less able to roll.

3	The scooter looks decent though, so that counts for something.

3	Well, at least as long as you are at this angle, since the boy's only got 1 foot on the 1 stud wide scooter.

3	The "A" Build, Inside Most of the interior has been seen already.

3	The roof though does a nice job of being interesting for a roof.

3	A skylight, the edge rails, etc.

3	And you can see there's not much "wrong color" in the walls.

3	The "A" Model, Sides An interesting building when folded up.

3	Very tall and skinny.

3	You can tell it's not really meant to be displayed this way - it's meant to be open.

3	The good - lots!

3	I like the awning, the diagonal door, the flowerbox under the upper window, the folding gate on the balcony that lets it be used in open or closed mode, and the green / white / blue colors.

3	The bad - well, the stairs end short of the upper door, I still don't really like the tan doorframes (I think black would have been better), and why don't the upper floors match up in size?

3	The "A" Model, Leftovers Ah, that's more like it.

3	Just a few small pieces left as spares.

3	The Errors You might have to click through to the full-size versions, but I did catch a few weird errors in the manuals.

3	First, in the photo of the newsstand, the map in the front corner is on there sideways.

3	The map does have a clear north arrow printed on it.

3	On the second image, the boy's feet are hanging off the edge.

3	Just unusual to see an alignment error in the manual like that.

3	The Comparison Here are this set and the modular Detective Office side by side.

3	There's a huge difference - as you'd expect.

3	But is the difference MORE than you'd expect?

3	This set is 466 parts, $40.

3	The DO is 2262 pieces and $160.

3	5 times the parts, 4 times the price.

3	Looking at them side by side, I'd expect a bigger difference in both.

3	The Conclusion So, what's my conclusion on this model?

3	I love the main model, but the alternates are meh.

3	It's a nice set for someone looking for a town building other than police and fire stations, but who isn't ready to move to the modular line.

3	Part of that is because the huge modulars are actually a great deal compared to other Lego sets.

3	I'm also a little surprised that it's so small, when you compare it to the City sets like a police station.

3	Those are generally designed with much more open space, letting them be more of a playset.

3	This one is small and cramped, so it'd be tougher to play in.

3	It's not really a City set though.

3	The Ratings Value: 7/10 - It's under the 10 cents a part mark, but that's largely due to having a TON of tiny parts.

3	All those flowers and decorative 1x1 round studs add up quickly!

3	Design: 7/10 - Good and bad on the colors, and there's a big difference between the quality of the main vs alternate models.

3	Having so many leftover pieces is one thing when the Creator set makes 3 very different models (ie a boat, plane, and truck).

3	When it's 3 buildings, it seems wasteful to have so many parts leftover.

3	Minifigs: 6/10 - I'm not sure they both fit the set.

3	I suppose the boy is going to the toy store and the woman is going to the grocery?

3	But there's no storekeeper in either.

3	The woman doesn't look like a storekeeper to me, so that's why I assume she's another shopper.

3	I love the boy, but the woman is just so-so - except that I do appreciate the head having two very different expressions.

3	But again, that doesn't fit the set.

3	I can't see her scared face being used.

3	Playability: 6/10 - The shops are detailed with registers and so forth, but it's all so tiny it'd be hard to play with the figs in it.

3	Parts: 9/10 - Tons of windows and doors, plus nice sand green bricks.

3	But some things (the large blue curves used on the roof for example) are weirdly specialized and would be hard to use in another building design.

3	Overall: 7/10 - I'd recommend doing what I did - build the alternates first, then the main since that's how you'll want to leave it.

3	I'd really like to see the price a little lower compared to other sets (again, the part count is inflated due to SO MANY tiny parts) and the finished building is tiny, but it's loaded with neat details.

2	Great review!

2	Very thorough.

2	It's not a set which makes me run to tye store, but it definitely has some fun elements.

2	I do like your new grey background.

2	Your pictures look great!

2	Any chance you have a picture of the News Stand next to the Detectives Office building as I would love to see the scaling for that?

2	Nice review mostlytechnic.

2	I particularly like the use of grey background surface for the pictures.

2	It somehow makes the building stand out more.

2	Good job!

1	A terrific, very comprehensive review - but I'm not at all impressed with this set.

1	It feels like a mishmash of bricks with no clear design aesthetic and as such blatantly underdeveloped (i.e.

1	designed to hit a price/brick count point rather than provide a solid set in the Creator Town tradition).

2	Well, I felt like the main model ALMOST got to good looking :) I'd replace some of the tan with black, but otherwise I'm ok with that one.

1	Cheers for putting in the time to create a wonderful review.

1	I am not a huge fan of this set; I like the colour combinations, but it all seems a bit all-too-simple.

1	It can (and will) be nicely modularised, though!

2	Thanks 'mostlytechnic' for this review, I only brought this set to continue the shop series from creator.

2	In my opinion it's only half as good as the bike shop/cafe one.

2	Plus it doesn't fit the same as that pair of shops, oh well maybe next year Lego creator will have a better one.

2	Brick On Review On 'mostlytechnic' !

3	Reviews for this set really should picture them next to the Bike Shop & Cafe, which it's intended to be compatible with right down to the size of the baseplates and grey tiles around the edge.

3	It doesn't look that great on its own, but if you add the two sets together you get something that begins to look like a street scene.

1	Brick On Review On 'mostlytechnic' !

1	Well, it IS only half the price of the bike/cafe one too :) But I agree, it seems odd that they've made a couple "shop" creator sets that don't fit together in style like this.

1	I guess they've done that for years with the creator houses though - none of those really work together.

1	Interesting to get two comments right in a row with opposite opinions :) I don't have the bike/cafe set, but to me, they don't looks like they'd really go together.

1	They're the same concept (two buildings that fold in half) but the sidewalk is different size and they just feel differently styled to me.

2	This seems like half of a set compared to the previous Bike Shop/Cafe.

2	As I like many of the elements, I will probably buy a second one and build a mirror image version (making one entirely a toy shop and the other a book store/news stand) and adjust the sidewalks to work with the previous model.

2	Then I think they will work well together.

2	I remember a little area in Copenhagen that had this sort of architecture.

2	I would hope the subsequent models are better deigned to create more complex alternatives, but these are both good starting points for original or enhanced models.

3	As a fan of Creator houses, I really want to like this set.

3	However, I think that Creator houses have long filled a niche that's neglected elsewhere: residential houses.

3	We haven't had a larger residential house since 2013; I'm not sure if these sets have anything to do with that, but it seems like they may be the replacement for larger houses.

3	And I'd much rather have a larger house set than a set like this.

3	I also agree with many others here; something about it just feels incomplete.

3	I think that the various City business buildings we've gotten in recent years (including those in this year's City Square--which is much more expensive than this, but also contains much more) make for better buildings at this scale.

3	Thanks andy_0306uk, your very clever strategic decision to serve us with blurry pictures allowed me to glance at this review without ruinating that whole wonderful Advent surprise too much.... :-P *y* But although I loved the last year?s one, I think they could do another theme (or perhaps even two calendars), because right now Castle?s pretty hot IMO.

2	Thank you Andy for your speed review!

2	*y* So there?s nothing left to open while advent?

2	;-) I like all the tiny sets, it needn?t be another police- and fireman |-/ , but well, what would an advent calendar be without them?

2	:-D One thing about the train traffic lights: TLC used to give us similar lights, but you could show either of the lights with the other one being covered: That one was waaay better!

2	:'-( Just a little piece more would have done the thing... ...and I won?t mention the radar-crap-dish :-X Let me quote Franz Beckenbauer: "Is' denn scho' Weihnacht?"

2	(legendary quote from an promotional job he did years ago - "is it X-mas already?")

2	Yeah, I guess this would need a little more "out of the box" thinking than TLC?s doing usually for their Castle line....

2	Things that are similar to the City theme, and more civil life based, like some blacksmith equipment, market place, bakery, farmer and so on, but a wizard workshop, a hidden treasure and some medieval furniture would also work fine.... And an evil Santa with spiders and coal pieces as gifts.... and a sledge pulled by a dragon of course.

2	:-D

1	no girls....AGAIN!

1	and no santa?

1	whats up with that?

1	sure there are many nice pieces to give life to every city layout.. i would love something more simple a girl taking her dog for a walk a boy on a bicycle simpler things...not all the workmen again!

3	Informative review, thanks!

3	*y* As usual, it makes a fairly good parts pack.

3	Wish I could pick up a few on deep discount, but at full price one is fine.

3	I do like the 'stewards' and some of the workmen.

3	Overall, I think I'm looking more forward to the Belville calendar, just for it's assortment of unusual parts.

3	Ugh.

3	Belville.

3	Still, parts are parts, and it's got some.

3	Phoinix summed up one of the most common complaints I hear about all of the lines in 3 simple words ... "no girls....AGAIN!"

3	Good job, now get LEGO to listen.

3	;-)

2	Whoa!

2	It's out already!

2	*places order* I guess I should thank you Andy, because I might have missed this one just like I missed last year's calendar.

2	Now all I have to do is wait two weeks and pick it up at the post office across the border.

2	Nice review.

1	Thanks Andy for the review!

1	I prefer the city advent calendar 2006 a lot!

1	Those mini sets are nor good for me!

1	The "road subtheme" sets are nice, but the others, not so good!

1	The 05 version waf ok, the 06 version was better, with bigger sets, and more building ones!

1	And the 07 is poor!

1	It's just 2-3 pieces to put together on 2x4 plates... Where are the gardening accessories?

1	Where are some nice small constructions that you can put in your layout like a mailbox or an orodator?

1	And the chrismas tree looks :-X IMO!

3	*yoda* Wow, interesting!

3	Lego is really expanding with this advent calendar thing!

3	Watch, next year they'll have ones for specific themes, Boy o boy, think about it, Star Wars Advent Calendar, Indy Advent claendar.

3	Of course, this is only speculation, but it would be cool!

3	X-D I'll probably buy both of these (even though I'm a boy ;-) ) so I get 2 surprises every day instead of one!

3	:-P ;-)

2	I'm a big fan of anime and have watched some mechas like Full Metal Panic, Neon Evangelion: Genesis (it is a mecha!)

2	and Chobits (Well... She is a robot...), so I was curious to see what this new Exo Force line was all about.

2	The colorful sets and manga-like characters didn't persuade me right away, but the urgent need for a couple of white 3x3 wing plates made me purchase this little thing.

2	It cost me 70 DKR as you can see on the box.

2	This is 9.30 euro, or about the same an American has to pay for the new Republic Cruiser.

2	Pretty expensive for so few pieces (90 + a spare technic pin) The box An action-packed box with one of the sides being oddly empty except from the LEGO-logo.

2	What's inside There is a small building instruction, two polybags (no bag building here) and a sticker sheet with alarmingly many stickers.

2	The build It takes so little time to build this set that I didn't get to take any pictures of the process.

2	Every step was accompanied by an element description although I doubt most of you will need that with so few pieces to keep track on.

2	Most of the dark green bricks have a sticker - even the slopes where the rough surface makes stickers fall off easily!

2	There should also have been a sticker on the windshield, but I wanted to keep that piece clean for better usage later.

2	(I'm one of those who keeps stickers on the bricks) The model You want to see this model from the front, as the back is pretty much neglected There isn't much for the pilot to grab a hold on either.

2	He is pretty much a sitting duck up there with the screen giving him only partial cover.

2	There is a huge wrench next to him which kind of symbolizes the crudeness of the mech.

2	The set isn't called "Cyclone Defender" for nothing.

2	The right arm might hold an ordinary light assault riffle, but the other has a spinning disc with samurai swords which you can turn with the yellow knob on the backside.

2	Those of you who have seen Robot Wars might remember the incredible power of this melee weapon from a robot named Hypnodisc.

2	It would have been nice had there been a pull-back motor to power the disc (I'm sure LEGO has a lot of these in stock), but the simple mechanism still works reasonably well.

2	The riffle comes off and a pin makes it easy to hold with the hand, but the disc is fixed to the arm.

2	It is also a problem that the swords get misaligned quickly during play.

2	The minifig I really like this minifig because of the neat idea with an expression on each side that LEGO has made a standard for Exo Force.

2	Posability Most mech-moc'ers show off their creations using Gundam-like poses.

2	With two joints per leg (one being the ankles) and one for an arm I thought of some less serious poses: Crawling (Silent like a ninja!

2	): Belly gliding: Kick off!

2	; Upside down: Final Rating I have to disappoint you here.

2	This is my first set in this line and I have absolutely no idea of how good it is.

2	The last robot I bought was the awesome 6889 Spyrius Recon Robot for the same price, but it is in a completely different genre.

2	The set had what I expected (two white wings) and is as such a no-nonsense set.

2	I guess it would be of more use if you have some more Exo Force, which I don't.

2	6/10 Ups: Has great minifig, weapons and is easy to build.

2	Downs: Crude design and a bit too expensive for what you get.

3	A funny review with cool pics, thanks Lasse D. A somehow mediocre mecha design, but a beautiful dark green color!

3	Upside down mecha yoga exercises on!

3	:-D

2	Nice review :) But... You paid HOW much?

2	This set is priced around 7 Euros here in Germany, which is a very fair price for what you get in my oppinion.

2	It?s a little disappointing though, that I couldn?t think of any alternate builds for this set, and there are no inspirations on the box or the EF website.

2	9.30 euro is MSRP here in Denmark.

2	7 euro would have resulted in a nicer reception from my part, but the strong marked position of LEGO in its homeland together with the general high prices (because some of us are supposedly rich...) makes the prices less bearable.

2	It is funny you should mention Germany.

2	I thought the prices for LEGO were even higher there!

2	I'm sure I paid more than MSRP last time I bought LEGO from from your country.

2	On the other hand.

2	The last thing I bought was the 5521 Model Team sea jet from 1993!

1	I was going to buy one of these but decided not to.

1	I am glad now seeing the rather annoying construction.

1	The minifig is good though, Thanks for the review!

3	I couldn't find a review of this wonderful set in here, so here it goes!

3	I got the set for MSRP (180kr = 24 euro) which is a fair price here in Denmark.

3	As all other Creator sets there are instructions for several models (3 in this case).

3	The box The box is a little larger than City sets in the same price range.

3	The primary model is shown on the front while you see the secondary ones on the back.

3	What you get 312 pieces in 5 polybags and two building instructions: one for the primary model and the other for the rest.

3	The built It was impossible for me to speed build this model because of the nifty functional details from the retractable landing gear to the wings that can turn by means of the handle in the back of the model.

3	It took me a full hour to build it because I had to "test" how it all works together.

3	The finished model The landing gear isn't fully enclosed when retracted and the models are sub-minifig scale, but I still love the design of the models.

3	The doors for the rear wheels open as you pull the wheels down and the final piece of functionality comes from the wings that can either tilt (the horizontal stabilizers) or have elevators.

3	Wing in, wings out, wings in, wings out... Ratings As a whole I actually like this set even more than the Big Rig.

3	The models are just as diverse but the added functionality makes the plane more fun to play with than the rig.

3	Price: 7/10 - A good price, but not a bargain as the Big Rig Design: 9/10 - There could have been a sligtly higher level of details in the main model, but all models are really good looking and I especially like the design of the hovercraft.

3	Functionality: 10/10 - I guess you could ask for working rudders, opening cockpit and so on, but the plane is really filled with movable parts and the turning of the wings works really well.

3	Secondary models: 7/10 - A hovercraft!

3	How awesome is that!?

3	If only the last model was just as inventive instead of a standard helicopter... Modifiability: 8/10 - The bricks are in ordinary colours and there is a good variety of them giving you plenty of possibilities for MOC'ing.

3	You can easily make the main model into something that looks more like an F-14.

3	9/10 Probably as good as it gets for a Creator set in this price range.

3	It is entertaining to both build and play with, looks good and the secondary models are worth building as well!

3	(Brickshelf gallery)

3	Thanks!

3	I was planning on doing this review but I have been a bit swamped lately.

3	:-$ Great review of a great set.

3	It isn't too hard to convert the plane to Mini-fig size either.

3	(Sorry I forgot to take photos...) I might add some photos to your review....

3	Nice review and a nice set.

3	Thanks for taking the time.

3	I'll want to pick this guy up.

3	Hovercraft Alternate model.

3	Uses around 4/5th of the parts.

3	It is cool but a bit fragile.

3	Great review Lasse D. A definite two *y* up.

3	I bought this set for the swing-wing concept.

3	I was very curious what TLC's design was like.

3	I have been working on modifying it just a little to look more like the F-14.

3	So far I have completed the back section, but I need to finish the cockpit.

3	Overall this is a great set.

3	I *wub* TLC's swing-wing concept.

3	Model On!

3	!

3	this is a really great set!

3	when i first saw it i thought "oh a silly small plane who needs that" and then i got it and i am very happy that i did!

3	this is one of the best designed lego creator sets!

3	and it was designed by the designer of the Cafe-Corner!!!

3	!

3	A fine set, a great review and good additional pictures.

3	Thanks Lasse D and Sinner.

3	Teamwork on!

3	*y*

2	Thank you Sinner for bringing the pictures of the hovercraft.

2	I think it is a really cool model, but The steering wheel doen't work too well.

2	It doesn't turn easilly all the way around and when the craft turns, it doesn't stay stable on the three wheels because the front wheel turns quite alot into the opposite side.

2	Now to the third model!

2	This is quite a basic helicopter with the functionality of having the rotors turning.

2	It doesn't use that many of the bricks and doesn't even have a landing gear.

2	I have a question to all of you.

2	As you can see, I prefer to show one or two large pictures and have the rest as clickable thumbnails.

2	Most people use only the relatively big (typically 640x480) pictures so that you don't have to follow links.

2	What do you prefer?

2	It is no problem for me to do it the other way, but I would like to know if you have any preferences.

2	I think it is a really cool model, but The steering wheel doen't work too well.

2	I agree.

2	Errr... sorry if I have annoyed you by posting the pictures.

2	Looking at your Brickshelf folder you had taken photos of the hovercraft as well and I seem to have stepped on your toes.

2	:-$ Feel free to beat me up, or I could do it myself if you prefer... 8-| (I prefer bigger pictures as I get tired of clicking, waiting, clicking, waiting.

2	If the pictures are all there all you have to do is click then wait!

2	:-P )

3	Thanks for this excellent review Lasse D!

3	:-) I was thinking about getting this the other day but decided not to.

3	I regret my actions!

3	Glad to see Creator making great sets, the theme has so much potential, I just wish that this set had more models... |-/ Oh well can't have it all, anyway, Thanks!

3	*sweet* Batbrick Away!

2	I can see the loading issue when you click a lot of pictures (I normally hold CTRL down so that they open in their own tabs... but they still have to load).

2	Any other opinions?

2	That's a relief!

2	:-) I didn't make the helicopter as it didn't impress me very much.

2	I was curious about the hovercraft though.

3	?34.99 is not too shabby.

3	The big guy itself is nice, but the gem of the set is the Mech.

3	Really nice Mech I must say!

3	Great for posing.

3	The Mini figs Suprisingly nice little build/vehicle.

3	Never seen this element before....its probably nothing new though, Lol.

3	No articulation of the legs?

3	Nooooooo!

3	Phew!

3	The front two legs do articulate.

3	Would of been bad if they didnt.

3	Overall, I give the set 7.8/10.

3	Not the best, but its actually quite nice, and the Yellow Mech is awesome.

3	If it was him on his own, then 9.4/10!

3	Cheers

1	Thanks for the review!

1	I really dislike this set but I thought much worse of it when we saw the first pic.

1	I think it was a good idea (mech transporter) pursued in a horribly wrong way!

1	:-X Thanks again!

1	:-) Batbrick Away!

1	>:-)

3	I so need to buy this!

3	Where did you get it from?

3	It says limited, so I guess it?s only available in certain stores, as the Bridge Walker was, or Supernova or Golden Guardian.

3	Nice!

3	*y* Doesn't look that bad at all, but what's with the first pic?

3	The one of Skeleton Tower?

3	*wacko* Is it so we can see the corner of the intructions?

2	*wacko* In the future when I buy all the exo-force sets off bricklink or ebay, I'll get this one for the decent yellow mecha, and cool function (carrying mecha), and just for completion sake.

2	Most people are getting to worked up over this, one bad set doesn't mean the end of exo-force, though I would like to see less two-legged mechas and more unconventional designs like the Shadow Crawler and Bridge Walker.

2	Batbrick Away!

2	>:-)

1	Consider the first pic a freeby pic, to whet your appetite.

1	:-$ 8-?

1	:'-)

3	It?s for sure an at least interesting set.

3	The idea of attaching that small mecha to the bugs body is very good, so it works like a counterpart to the Aero Booster.

3	Pretty nice.

3	Although.... only the two front legs?re articulated?

3	That?s a shame.... :'-( Thanks for the review, ReZourceman.

3	*y*

2	I like how the back is a prison, but aside from that it looks like spare parts to me!

2	Thanks for the review though.

2	*sweet*

3	Nice!

3	I really want this now.

3	The yellow mech was the thing I disliked on it, but now its my favourite part of it.

3	-ZotS

3	that yellow mech would make a killer $10 set!

3	I would buy it on its own... *wub*

2	Why are the best sets limited editions?

2	Nightmare_Zero, on Oct 14 2007, 03:59 PM, said: Why are the best sets limited editions?

2	>:-( You can still get it quite easily at S@H or in Lego Stores.

2	I know of one in Oberhausen and in Cologne, and I think there?s one in Hamburg and Munich as well.

2	Depending on where you live you might get it in one of those shops fpr 49.99 Euros.

2	I just got set number 7721, the new special edition crawler thing in woolworths in croydon, england.

2	Apparently it is a woolworths exclusive over here and i didnt expect to see it on shelves for a while yet.

2	Pleased to get it, just about to start building it.

2	looks like a very good set.

2	I love the yellow mech.

3	i got a set of this but i planning to sell away to earn money to buy another set since im almost broke right now.

3	:-D i got a set of this but i planning to sell away to earn money to buy another set since im almost broke right now.

3	:-D

2	Does anyone have a box pic of this set?

2	DP8

3	It is no secret that Marvel is one of the most successful companies right now.

3	From the Avengers to the X-Men and down to even the most obscure characters like Ant-Man, every one of their movies has been a big hit until now.

3	The latest Marvel movie, Fant4stic, was released last month and while I have not seen it yet, I'm sure it's just as great as their other movies.

3	I mean, it has the word "Fantastic" in the title after all!

3	And being the smart business that they are, The Lego Company decided to get in on the hype early and capitalize on this movie's undoubtful success two years in advance by making a set featuring Fant4stic's main villain, Dr. Doom.

3	Now that's what I call forward thinking!

3	But did they do a good job with it or were they being overhasty?

3	Let's find out!

3	Set Number: 76005 Name: Spider-Man: Daily Bugle Showdown Theme: Marvel Super Heroes Subtheme: Ultimate Spider-Man Year of Release: 2013 Pieces: 476 Minifigs: 5 Price: $49.99 USD S@H description: Quote Swing into the Daily Bugle and stop Dr. Doom™!

3	Dr. Doom™ and his henchman Beetle™ are attacking the Daily Bugle in their speedy jet to steal Spider-Man's™ secret identity.

3	It's up to Spider-Man™ and Nova™ to swing in and stop them!

3	Trigger the Daily Bugle's explosion functions to cause destruction as the jet fires missiles!

3	Stop Dr. Doom™ from hitching the jet's anchor hook to the safe with Spider-Man's secret inside!

3	Knock Beetle™ off the building with the swinging web attack and drop Dr. Doom™ inside with the rooftop trapdoor!

3	Then fly Nova™ in through the broken window with the dumpster catapult function and send those villains back to where they came from.

3	Includes Spider-Man™, Nova™, Dr. Doom™, Beetle™ and J. Jonah Jameson™ with accessories and weapons.

3	The first thing that comes to mind after reading this description is: Wow, that's a lot of TMs!

3	Anyway, here are some resource links for this set: Brickset Bricklink Rebrickable The Box Since this set is based on the Ultimate Spider-Man cartoon, the box has the usual USM design with the red Marvel Super Heroes background, an illustration of Spidey in the upper right corner, and the USM logo in the lower right.

3	As usual, there is a minifig line up in the lower left, and since this was before the terrible redesign, you can see the full body of the minifigs.

3	I really miss this type of line up.

3	There is quite a lot going on here: Doctor Doom attacking the Daily Bugle in his jet while simultaneously reaching for J. Jonah Jameson below with his jet's claw, Spider-Man (reluctantly) swings in to save him, while Nova fights off the Beetle.

3	It's a pretty cool scene, even though it's not very accurate to the show.

3	In "Beetle Mania", the episode that this set is based on, the Beetle was indeed out to kill JJJ, but it was in order to stop him from exposing his identity, not Spider-Man's (although Spidey was next on JJJ's list).

3	And while he is a recurring villain on the show, Doctor doom had nothing to do with this plot and didn't even appear in the episode aside from a brief cameo.

3	It's awesome that they included him anyway, though, so I'm not gonna complain.

3	Note that the tower is so tall that it wraps around the top of the box.

3	There, you can also see a scale reference with the Spider-Man minifig.

3	On the back of the box, you can see the interior of the Bugle and all of its play features which there are quite a few of since this is a playset.

3	It's all illustrated pretty well, although Lego's choice of sound effects is still a mystery to me.

3	I don't get why they don't go for Spider-Man's signature "Fwip!"

3	instead of "Fazzing!"

3	and I didn't know that a breaking window made the sound "Btoom!"

3	but I digress.

3	Contents Inside the box you will find three instruction booklets (one smaller than the others), a comic book, a fairly large sticker sheet, five numbered bags, and two loose pieces: A white string piece and a gray 16x8 plate.

3	There aren't really any notable pieces and nobody cares about the comic bock (no offense to the artist), so lets get right to the instructions.

3	They are pretty straight forward and easy to follow.

3	Some of the pages have a ghostly image of Spidey, Nova, and Dr. Doom in the top right corner which is fitting since these are all minifigs that appear in this set (which is strangely not something that can be said for many other Super Heroes instructions with this type of artwork).

3	Minifigures As with most Super Heroes sets, most people will get this set mainly for the minifigs, so without further ado, let's talk about them.

3	Spider-Man is the same old bootless one you get in almost every USM set.

3	Not much to say about him.

3	Some might complain that we don't get Spidey's alter ego Peter Parker in this set, but in the USM cartoon, MJ is actually the one who works at the Daily Bugle, not Peter.

3	Curse the creators of this cartoon for ruining our chances of getting a new Peter Parker minifig by trying to mix things up.

3	Next we get J. Jonah Jameson.

3	He appeared in a Spider-Man 2 set before, but this is a complete redesign.

3	He now has a blue suit with a red tie, a unique face print, and that combed-back hair in dark gray.

3	This new hairpiece doesn't suit him at all and the old flat top hair was perfect for him in my opinion, so I don't know why they changed it.

3	The good thing about this change, however, is the fact that this piece is exclusive to this set in that color.

3	Nova on the other hand is spot-on.

3	He comes with a new helmet mold and some nice torso printing.

3	However, he, too, is missing his boots.

3	TLC should have started making dual-colored legs a long time ago.

3	Here are some reference images to compare them to.

3	Okay, so JJJ's hair may not be completely black in the show, but I still think they should have given his minifig a black hairpiece.

3	His suit is also not quite the right color.

3	He rarely appears in person in the show (including the episode this set is based on) and is usually seen on screens around New York, so this is the best picture of him I could find.

3	I guess I should be happy they included a minifig of him at all.

3	In the episode, it was actually Mary Jane who was at the Bugle during Beetle's attack, so it would have made more sense to include her, but we got her in the Spider-copter set one year later, so that's ok. All three of them have back printing.

3	In JJJ's case I'm using that term loosely since it is only comprised of two lines, but it's nice that they went through the trouble of adding them.

3	Both JJJ and Nova come with angry alternate faces.

3	It almost looks like they're trying to out-angry each other.

3	Who do you think looks angrier?

3	Let me know in the comments section below.

3	Now let's talk about the bad guys.

3	Even though he would be better off in a Fantastic Four set, it's great to finally get Victor Van Doom, one of the greatest Marvel villains ever and in comics in general.

3	He comes with a dark green hood which was new and exclusive in that color at the time, and he is the only minifig in this set that has leg printing.

3	Beetle is a regular minifig with wings.

3	The metallic printing on his face and torso is pretty nice, but I wish it would have continued onto his legs as well.

3	The Beetle looks quite accurate to his on-screen counterpart.

3	The only thing that could have improved him is a new helmet mold with pointy eyebrows/antennae.

3	Doctor Doom, however, looks nothing like he does in the movie.

3	I just don't understand how Lego could have messed him up so badly.

3	Maybe they were working off of early concept art or something.

3	Here is a back view of Doom and Beetle.

3	Beetle would be a pretty boring minifig if it wasn't for his wings which are awesome with their holographic texture.

3	They are so mesmerizing, I could look at those things all day.

3	This piece also appeared in trans.

3	light green in the Galaxy Squad sets which came out at the same time.

3	Here they are without their gear.

3	As you can see, they both have back printing as well.

3	And no, Doctor Doom does not come with an alternate facial expression, which is fine since you can't see much of his expressions due to his mask anyway.

3	Here's a look at Dr. Doom and Nova without their headgear.

3	Some say that Doom's face looks too cartoony, but I think it looks fine.

3	Nova is wearing stylish goggles as a way of explaining his white eyes.

3	It's a far better explanation than the Bat-sweatband.

3	They did the same thing with the masked Wolverine later.

3	Here are all the figs with their accessories.

3	JJJ comes with a camera so that he can take "more pictures of Spider-Man!"

3	Beetle comes with one of those overused ADU guns which is a very poor representation of his wrist-mounted blasters.

3	I hate to say it, but even those bulky new stud shooters would have been a better representation of his weapons.

3	Spidey comes with his usual string of webbing and Nova comes with some Iron Man style translucent studs.

3	The weird thing is that they are red while his powers have a blue glow in the show.

3	Doctor Doom sadly doesn't get any accessories, but who needs weapons when you have a jet with a claw and flick-fire missiles.

3	The Build The first bag contains Spider-Man, a brick separator, and the parts to build the ground floor of the DBC building.

3	After a quick and straight-forward build, you get this.

3	The dumpster and street lamp are separate from the building and since the lamp post is not built onto any baseplate and is quite top-heavy, it gets knocked over pretty easily.

3	Maybe it's meant to be that way, but I would have preferred it if you could stick it onto the baseplate of the building on which there is unfortunately not enough space to do so.

3	As you would expect, the second bag has the parts for the first floor of the building.

3	This is also the bag that contains Beetle.

3	After another fairly simple build, you'll find yourself with a two story building with a spiderweb one side and a fire escape on the other.

3	However, you have to apply three stickers during this section of the build which is never fun.

3	Can you guess what's in bag number 3?

3	Yup, the second floor of the building.

3	You don't need superpowers to predict that one.

3	Also, this bag contains Nova and Jameson.

3	The build of this section is a bit repetitive since the second floor is mostly the same as the first and it takes slightly longer to build since you have to build the rooftop as well.

3	Also, in addition to the two window stickers you have to apply ten 2x2 tile stickers!

3	Trying to do this without having any of them being crooked is a real pain in the megablocks.

3	The next bag contains Doctor Doom and the cockpit of his jet.

3	Doom's cape is in the usual square white box and the string for the claw is folded up in a piece of tape.

3	Here's what you get at the end of this section.

3	Looks more like an escape pod than a jet at this point.

3	The final bag is the smallest as it only includes the few parts needed to finish the Doom jet.

3	Once you build the wings and tail, you stick them onto the cockpit via Technic pins and you're done.

3	Spare Parts These are the parts that are left over after the build.

3	There is the brick separator of course, an extra antenna, and the usual little bits and bops.

3	What's really awesome, though, is that they give you an extra pair of Beetle's wings!

3	Considering what a neat piece this is and that this is the only set in which it comes in trans-black make this a very welcome spare that you can use in your customs.

3	The Finished Set Here is the complete set.

3	The DBC building looks quite tall, especially when you count the antenna.

3	Comparing it to a screenshot from the episode, the general look of the building is there, although there are some inaccuracies.

3	Aside from the fact that it is obviously way down-scaled, the screens that show JJJ ranting about Spider-Man should have been hexagonal, not square, and should have wrapped around the building.

3	However, considering how many stickers you would have had to apply if they would have made it accurate, I'm actually glad they kept the screen mercifully small.

3	Much like Doctor Doom himself, the Doom jet didn't actually appear in the Beetle Mania episode.

3	However, it did appear in a later episode titled "Not A Toy" in which Spider-Man plays around with Captain America's shield, accidentally drops it in Doctor Doom's Latvarian embassy and has to try to retrieve it.

3	And yes, that episode was as godawful as it sounds.

3	Here's a screenshot of the jet from that episode.

3	Like with the DBC, they managed to capture the general shape of the vehicle, although it doesn't look quite as good as in the show.

3	The color scheme is too dark and it looks kind of blockier.

3	Let's take a closer look at the jet.

3	There is no real way to reel the claw in unfortunately.

3	However, there is a stud on the back of the jet that you can stick it onto.

3	Needless to say, this is not the ideal way of storing it.

3	I would have much preferred it if they would have attached it onto winch instead.

3	The engines on the wings can be turned, even though they don't turn in the show, and there is a flick-fire missile on each side.

3	Even if it's not much to look at, at least it's a very swooshable vehicle.

3	On top of each wing there is a tile with the emblem of Latvaria.

3	There was no such emplems on the jet in the cartoon, but they are useful pieces that make it clear whose jet it is, so I'm glad they included them.

3	There is nothing inside the cockpit except for a seat and unless you want to ruin Dr. Doom's nice dark green cape, I wouldn't put him inside of it.

3	They could have at least printed a control panel onto that empty 2x2 tile.

3	Play Features Since this is a playset, let's look at all the play features it has to offer.

3	Like all playsets, the building is open in the back so you can play inside.

3	On the ground floor, there is a potted plant and... nothing else.

3	Seriously?

3	Is this all they could come up with for this floor?

3	They could have included a security desk, a lounge, a second plant, or anything else!

3	As it is, it's just a boring empty lobby.

3	The first floor is a bit more interesting.

3	There is a safe, a swiveling chair, and a pin board with various pictures of Spider-Man.

3	There is one tile that reads: "The true identity of Spider-Man" which is supposedly what the villains are after.

3	I wonder how Jameson got this information in the first place.

3	Speaking of Jameson, the second floor is devoted to his office where he can sit and yell at his non-present employees, demanding "more pictures of Spider-Man!"

3	It also has a swiveling chair as well as a desk with a lamp and a computer.

3	There is a Technic beam connecting his desk with the ceiling of the first floor which you can remove in order to take off the upper half of the building, but it's difficult to do, so I don't recommend it.

3	As you may have noticed in the picture above, there are a few red pegs sticking out of the building.

3	These are for triggering the play features.

3	Most of them are on the roof.

3	There is one on what looks like an air conditioning unit.

3	If you place Spider-Man holding is web-string on the jumper plate in front of it and push the peg, Spidey goes bungee-jumping off the building.

3	Wee!

3	There is also one that sticks out of the side of the building which when pulled triggers a trap door.

3	The third red peg on the roof can be used to pop off the DBC sign.

3	Why is it called the DBC, you ask?

3	It stands for Daily Bugle Communications since in this version of Spider-Man, the Daily Bugle is not only a newspaper, but a news TV station as well, one that promotes its own highly biased views.

3	So basically the Fox News of the Marvel universe.

3	I guess if you're an old school Spider-Man fan, you could just leave off the "C" and have it just stand for Daily Bugle.

3	The sign above the main entrance wont be so easily modified however.

3	There is also a peg between the first and second floor which when pushed pops out one of the windows on the first floor.

3	The safe is only attached to a couple of jumper plates and has some jumper plates on top of it as well, so you can easily attach the Doom jet's claw to it and rip it out of the building as seen on the back of the box.

3	There are also some SNOT bricks on the corners of the building that you can attach spiderwebs or Spidey himself onto for some wall-crawling and webslinging action.

3	This is not so much a play feature as it is just a feature, but as I mentioned earlier, there is a fire escape on the left side of the building.

3	This was a neat idea as it helps it feel like a building in New York City, but it is executed very poorly.

3	There is no hole big enough for the minifigs to climb down through, so they would have to climb down the ladders from the outside which makes no sense.

3	No wonder Spider-Man always needs to rescue people from burning buildings.

3	There is one more play feature in the form of the dumpster.

3	You can open the lid, put a minifig inside, and make them jump by hitting a tab in the back.

3	Remember, this is before the introduction of super jumpers, but nevertheless it's a pretty strange place to launch minifigs out of.

3	I guess even Super Heroes like to do some dumpster diving.

3	You don't think this was funny?

3	No?

3	Well, me neither, but that's the type of humor that this show loves to use.

3	Sigh.

3	Anyway, let's get on to the ratings.

3	Ratings Design: 2/5 - The set looks ok.

3	Despite many inaccuracies, the DBC building and the jet somewhat resemble their on-screen counterparts and don't look too bad, but they definitely could be better.

3	Build: 1/5 - A mostly unchallenging and repetitive build with an attrocious amount of stickers.

3	Minifigs: 4/5 - Definitely the strongest point of the set.

3	Some of the figs could be better, but four out of five of them are exclusive to this set.

3	Doctor Doom is easily the best and probably the most desirable one - unless the Fant4stic movie portraits him so badly that nobody will be interested in him, but that's impossible.

3	Playability: 4/5 - As you would expect from a playset, the playability is quite high, although I still feel like there could have been more.

3	Parts: 3/5 - Not many rare parts.

3	If you're looking for parts for building your own skyscraper with tan walls and lots of doors and windows though, this set is for you.

3	Price: 3/5 - At 476 parts for $50, this set is a bit pricey, but it is somewhat justified by all the large window and wall pieces.

3	Overall: 3/5 - This set is mediocre at best.

3	Playsets are always a good choice for Spider-Man sets since they give Spidey something to swing from, but unfortunately they are rarely pulled off well.

3	The jet is blocky, the building is bare-bones, and the price feels too high.

3	The only reason to get this set are the four exclusive minifigs.

3	This set was discontinued early this year, but if you still see it on clearance somewhere, go ahead and get one for the minifigs and parts, or buy multiples and use the parts to build a better DBC building.

3	I hope you enjoyed this review.

3	It is part of the Reviewers Academy's 7th Anniversary.

3	We're not doing a big celebration this year due to other commitments, but look out for more reviews with the 7th Anniversary banner soon.

3	Now, if you'll excuse me, I am off to see Fant4stic.

3	I hope it's as fantastic as it promises to be!

3	(2 hours later) I was wrong!

3	I was horribly, horribly wrong!

3	Hahah, entertaining and informative, a great read- thanks for the review!

3	On a side note I thought Fant-Four-Stic was....ok. On the poorer side of ok.

3	The exposition felt like it was from a 3 hour film because it was so long and towards the middle it started to drag.

3	The ending was terrible.

3	Edited by Mutant Orc, 12 September 2015 - 09:53 PM.

3	This is my favourite set!

3	Should be making more Spidey sets like this IMO.

3	*cough* Oscorp Tower *cough*

2	This set is from 2013, Doctor Doom is completely based off the Comic version/ TV Show version, not the movie in any way.

2	Anyways, nice review.

2	I personally own this set, and it's a nice set, but could have been better.

2	Edited by Aegis2000, 13 September 2015 - 02:33 AM.

3	Yeah.

3	I'm really hoping the concept art/Doom minifig joke is just that!

3	I picked this set up on whim, mostly because a needed a building to add to a MOC, as a parts pack it's not a bad set at all.

2	Thanks for the review, i've had that set for quite a while, and it's among my favorite Marvel Superheroes Sets actually.

2	Aegis2000, on 13 September 2015 - 02:32 AM, said: This set is from 2013, Doctor Doom is completely based off the Comic version/ TV Show version, not the movie in any way.

2	Anyways, nice review.

2	I personally own this set, and it's a nice set, but could have been better.

2	He's just joking about Doom.

2	I actually am surprised at the poor points this set has gotten, as this is one of my favorite sets that Marvel has put out.

2	I actually would like to hear what your thoughts are on the USM - LEGO Dr. Doom comparison, Oky.

2	Thanks for the review.

2	Thanks everyone!

2	Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad set, especially compared to some other sets we have gotten in this price range, but somehow I was still expecting more.

2	DarthBrickus, on 13 September 2015 - 02:53 PM, said: Maybe you're still suffering from PTSD after watching Fant-Four-Stic!

2	I still have not seen it actually (and I don't ever plan to).

2	So don't worry, no Okys were harmed in the making of this review.

2	Im a brickmaster., on 13 September 2015 - 03:55 AM, said: Yeah.

2	Thanks for the review.

2	http://marvelanimate...or_Doom_USM.png There's not much to say really.

2	Doom in USM looks just like he does in the comics, and Lego recreated that look perfectly.

2	Again, he's definitely the best part of this set.

2	I'm glad you were joking about Doom.

2	I'm not that big of a fanboy, but I had the need to correct you for some reason.

2	With that said, I bought this set for the minifigures a few years ago.

2	Looking back, I don't really care about the figures today like I did in 2013.

2	The building is decent for the size of the set though.

2	Thanks for the review.

2	For those of you who are old enough to remember System Shock: Next on Maury: Who's the Father?

2	Edited by DarthBrickus, 15 September 2015 - 05:28 PM.

2	Overall, I wish Marvel in particular would have more playsets in its theme (Batman has several great ones in the DC theme).

2	But then again, if this is the best playset to date for Marvel, maybe it's better just to leave well enough alone.

2	I would definitely like to see them attempt something in the $100+ (US) price range because I think it could be good; Marvel needs an equivalent to the Arkham Asylum set.

2	Regarding this set, I saved myself some money and bought the 4 minifigs I needed (all but Spidey) on Bricklink for less than half the set price.

2	Edited by dmarvin, 17 September 2015 - 06:25 PM.

2	Personally, I thought your review was spot on and I very much enjoyed your tone.

2	I'm not usually much of a mini-fig person, but I will admit I bought this set mostly for Dr. Doom (and considered Nova a bonus).

2	Growing up, I was a big fan of the Fantastic Four and an even bigger fan of Dr Doom.

2	I hope that someday the film rights will revert to Marvel and we'll finally get a FF film that respects the original source material and features a Dr Doom worthy of the name.

2	As for the set itself, I don't have much use for playsets (not that there's anything wrong with them, I think the Marvel Lego line could use more of them in fact) and I didn't even realize it was linked to a specific show as I've fallen a bit out of touch with the franchise of late.

2	I bought it; I built it; it sat a shelf for a while; I scrapped it for parts.

2	I think most of it wound up as a greenhouse for my winter village set-up.

2	It's not a _bad_ set, but I think you summed things up nicely when you called it mediocre.

2	Thanks for the entertaining review.

3	Thanks for the review.I'm not a big fan of Spider Man sets, but this set really impressed me.

3	This must because of the design of this set and the minifigures that included in this set.

1	I think I'm the only person in the world who likes Fant4stic... Was it the best superhero movie?

1	Not even close, but I didn't think it deserved the hate it got.

1	It was just incredibly and clumsily mishandled.

1	Anyways, great review.

1	I might pick this one up if only for the Beetle fig.

2	This set seems to appeal more to the non superhero crowd.

2	It is one of the only marvel sets I bought.

2	Mainly because I thought that the building was a nice return to the old style of city sets.

2	I would love to see this sort of backdrop for a more realistic agents theme...

2	I also liked that most of the figs in this set were easier to merge into other (non-super) uses...

2	Thanks for the review!

2	God Bless, Nathan

3	Another great review Oky.

3	I love this set.

3	Hi again!

3	They have arrived *wub*!

3	They come dismantled inside the package instead of one piece like the Blackhole Stormtrooper did.

3	They have the head and SW-sign made with magnets to clip on to the torso.

3	It actually works even if it feels a bit "cheapish".

3	Here?s some pictures - Mr Vader goes first *vader*: Package Pieces Stormie: Package Pieces My collection so far >:-) : Here?s the Blackhole Stormtrooper review.

3	Boba Fett & Luke Maquette On copmike

3	Super-cool!

3	Any text on the boxes of these ones?

3	The Stormie's left arm seems really long and slightly odd, but that's just because I'm jealous you've got one.

3	:-D Shorter than I was expecting though.

3	Dr. S.

3	Ooh, I want one.

3	I don't care which but I want one.

3	Perhaps *vader* ...

3	Thanks for the pics.

3	Must resist Ebay!!

3	Must resist!!!!

3	Hello everyone!

3	By now many excited LEGO Star Wars fans have started receiving their UCS Falcon.

3	Some of us here enjoy writing reviews and sharing our thoughts.

3	I mentioned to Yoda that I was planning on doing a review of this set but it would likely take me a few weeks (of 1-2 hours per night) to finish building the set.

3	Yoda suggested that I do the review as I go so everyone could see the progress of the set.

3	What a great idea!

3	So, here is the first entry.

3	Feel free to comment along the way.

3	I will try to post photos and updates every night on the build then wrap up the review when I complete the set.

3	If you have any specific questions or photo requests, please be sure to ask.

3	UCS Millennium Falcon Reviewed by Dunamis Set 10179 5195 Pieces $499.95 from LEGO Shop at home The Box: Obviously, this is a box like no other.

3	First of all, it comes in its own shipping carton.

3	Inside of that, there is a standard LEGO carton.

3	Finally, inside the LEGO carton, we have the actual Millennium Falcon box and a nice little letter thanking you for buying the biggest LEGO set ever.

3	Shipping box (Naboo set provided for scale) LEGO Carton and letter LEGO Carton The Millennium Falcon box is really quite nice.

3	There are lots of photos and it does a good job of ?selling?

3	the set.

3	There are 8 individual pieces of tape that keep the lid on the box.

3	The limited first edition comes with a seal on the lower left corner.

3	Millennium Falcon Box (Naboo set provided for scale) Lifting the lid straight up reveals one compartment of several bags on the right.

3	On the left, we find a thin, square box (like a pizza box) that contains the official certificate of authenticity, two sticker sheets and one enormous manual!

3	Under the pizza box, we find two more compartments each filled with several typical LEGO bags.

3	The box weighs 24 pounds!

3	Stickers Pizza Box Pieces in compartments Not quite sure what the little 30th anniversary sticker is for yet.

3	The Certificate of Authenticity is on heavy paper and is suitable for framing.

3	More to come tomorrow.

3	It's late here.

3	Good idea to make this review while you build the set.

3	I'll be monitoring your progress and feedback.

3	The box so huge!

3	Impressive!

3	Nice review.

3	I'll be watching and waiting for the rest.

3	Will follow this impatiently ;-) Really like the start of the review *y* You always seems to pull it of nicely, in comparission with the exasperating *yoda* X-D :-P Build On!

3	Play On!

3	On On!

3	Many tks Dunamis for doing that, its really great and I can't wait monitoring your progress on the beast 8-?

3	Like it was mentionned in another thread, the box looks less gigantic than I thought - remember the ISD box !!

3	That was a huge box !!

3	Is the instruction book in the pizza box ?

3	How big is it ?

3	I'm sure its really big and I hope for our sake that the colours are clearly marked X-D If you know what I mean :-D !!

3	Tks againand I'm so looking forward to your next post !!

3	Excellent beginning.

3	Our numbers are very close, but I haven't the luxury of space to build it, so I'll be enjoying it by proxy through you.

3	Enjoy!

3	*y*

2	xwingyoda, on Sep 27 2007, 11:18 AM, said: what what what >:-( Have you stopped your medication once again X-D No actually I?m out of fly agaric.

2	But now it?s that seasson to go out in the forest and refill the stock of those babys.

2	Vikings On!

2	!

2	Wow that box is big but i somehow thought it would be even bigger, still it looks like for once lego are actully using all the space inside and not just a fraction like with other sets.

2	Cant wait to see more dunamis.....you lucky megablok ;-)

3	What a wonderful idea, and how nice from you.... *sweet* And.... Go, Killer, Go!

3	!

3	Thats awesome man!

3	Lucky that you got it!

3	I want it so badly... and it has a huge box too!

2	*yoda* Interesting question regarding the size of the box vs. the ISD.

2	Here ya go: Also, I'll be posting more on the size of the manual a little later.

2	I'm going to be building for the next few hours... *sweet*

1	Tks for that comparison pic Dunamis ;-) OK the box is big !!

1	I pictured it a tad smaller though !!

1	I know what I don't like, its the fact that it has the regular Lego Star Wars logo on top with Vader.

1	UCS sets should have a different iconography like they did in the past.

1	Sure its a trivial detail but it adds to the fact of owning something special !!

1	After all its the most expensive set ever as of now ;-) Happy building !!

1	And we'll wait patiently for some cool pics later on :-P *yoda*

3	The Manual: The gigantic manual measures 17?

3	x 12?

3	and is almost an inch thick.

3	It is spiral bound with a cardboard like front and back and it is 314 pages.

3	Interesting decision not to break it up into multiple manuals.

3	It is almost unwieldy at this size and thickness.

3	Unfortunately, the manual is not available electronically from the LEGO website.

3	Hopefully, it will be soon.

3	Missing were the little instructions at the beginning telling you to not build this beast on shag carpet and to sort out the 5,000+ pieces before you get started.

3	I guess they figure if you got $500 to spend on this thing, you can build it however you want.

3	As usual, we get the regular LEGO manual features: - Piece call outs for each step - Parts inventory at the end of the manual - Page numbers - Photos of all the other 2007 sets at the end of the manual Manual (paperback book provided for scale) Various manual photos (8x8 plate provided for scale) I'm about 2 hours into building and sorting.

3	I'm trying to stay a day ahead in my posting.

3	The build has been easier than I thought so far.

3	Despite the massive number of pieces, it has not been too hard to sort and find what you need.

3	Build photos will start appearing in tomorrow's entry.

2	Very expecting indeed.

2	Waiting for your kind photo ... :-)

1	My gawd that manuel is huge!!!!!

1	That's enough to put a sane man off of buying this set.......Thank gawd none of us are sane thats all i can say X-D Just how many technic pins does this monster need???

1	8-?

1	Judging by that one pic theres gotta be a lot in this set.

3	Wow I never thought I'd be impressed by a box but I certainly am now.

3	Any chance of seeing all 5000 bricks in a big pile?

3	Vader, on Sep 28 2007, 10:14 AM, said: My gawd that manuel is huge!!!!!

3	That's enough to put a sane man off of buying this set.......Thank gawd none of us are sane thats all i can say X-D Too true, never had I imagined thinking about buying a ?350 Lego set before....Christmas is soo close yet soo far.

3	Nice idea, reviewing the set while constructing it.

3	This is the top of the bill for any lego-collector (also financially speaking..) and I like the look of all those thousands of pieces.

3	The manual is incredible, I thought I had a really thick manual coming with set 8479, but this one exceeds it with ease... Review on!

2	xwingyoda, on Sep 28 2007, 07:34 AM, said: Tks for that comparison pic Dunamis ;-) OK the box is big !!

2	I pictured it a tad smaller though !!

2	*yoda* I don't have the UCS ISD but from the pic i can see that it is about the same thickness, slightly shorter but much wider than the MF.

2	So this leads me to believe that dimension-wise the UCS MF is more compact.

2	Also, notice how in the content, the parts fit in just nice without additional spare space for anything else.

2	Strange isn't it that when TLC is responsible for the shipping, we see optimum usage of box spaces.

2	X-D imagine if all boxes were this efficient.

2	$4.99 sets would be no bigger than a match box!

2	X-D X-D the MTT would be reduced to 1/4 its current size!

2	X-D X-D X-D

3	good review.

3	*y* Me, I can't build it before Saturday.

3	:'-(

3	Great review so far!

3	I am looking forward to additional posts!

3	As for the number of pins - from the Peeron inventory for the set, there are over 400 technic pins of various lengths!

3	(insert the "my fingers hurt from building" emoticon) Keep the pictures coming!

3	The Build: The build is going quicker than I thought.

3	I am sorting as I open the bags that I need.

3	Some bags are in multiples so it is easy to pick them out.

3	The build is a tad repetitive as the framework of the ship is somewhat symmetrical.

3	Here are some progress shots: Note that two plates (1x4 and 1x8) are stacked in between Technic beams.

3	Then the part below is assembled to hold the structure together.

3	This took about an hour of sorting and building: I'll post another update tomorrow.

2	The Minifigs: As you can see, the minifigs are really nice.

2	They even throw in an extra fleshie head!

2	No doubt these will fetch quite a bit on the Bricklink and Ebay markets.

2	I?m keeping mine.

2	Continuing the Build This photo shows how well this model is put together.

2	Notice that they use four of the three-hole beams per side to hold this together.

2	I remember reading that you can hang this model from the ceiling.

2	I don?t doubt it.

2	These right angle Technic pieces are used to reinforce the structure of the model.

2	You can see them used here: I was shocked at how many light gray plates are in this set.

2	I have TWO tubs full of these: The infrastructure is now complete: I got hung up for about an hour looking for one of these: Turns out, LEGO gave me an extra left wedge and shorted me a right wedge.

2	So frustrating!

2	I had to stead one off my 6211 Star Destroyer.

2	It is not a very common piece by the way?

3	Hey nice review, im up to about the same point as you (page 70 to be exact) , tho i didnt have that missing piece thankfully!

3	I think lego have done a much better job at packing the lego this time, i remember it taking me much longer to find pieces on the UCS ISD build

2	So I see they even do mistakes on these |-/ That beast looks really sturdy !!

2	That is great !!

2	Are these yellow parts new ?

2	I am not a Technic fan and never saw these before.

2	Another question for you: is the instruction book easy to follow, especially regarding the colours.

2	Does the black rally stands out comparing to the dark bley and so on ?

2	I sure hope so ;-) Can't wait to see moer hehe *yoda*

2	xwingyoda, on Sep 30 2007, 11:57 AM, said: Are these yellow parts new ?

2	I am not a Technic fan and never saw these before.

2	You don?t have the building crane 7905 either?

2	Same color, same shape there: piece no.

2	32555 (four of them included) I assume you?re not a town fan?

2	:-P ;-)

3	I have been taking photos for this review for a few months and I finally took the rest of the photos last night.

3	All the parts.

3	If you want tan, this is the set to get!

3	Main model.

3	The garage is a great addition... ...but the car only just fits!

3	The main house is very nice looking.

3	The windows extend to the sides... ...but not the back.

3	The chimney and drainage work very well, and I love the "basement".

3	I think the front works very well.

3	When I was making this I was multitasking doing weight training; do a set, do a step, do a set... and I ended up missing one of the row paths.

3	I discovered this after I finished the basement.

3	:-| The removable roof reveals BYO floors.

3	Probably why this is called a Model house!

3	The roof was quite interesting to build.

3	This is my first large house set so it all was very new to me.

3	I love the garage door.

3	More nice pipework.

3	This photo I mis-focused but there isn't much to see anyway!

3	The door is a nice touch.

3	The grill to the right on both sides is not just decoration as it hides the hinges for the door.

3	I also made one of the sub-models.

3	I was considering keeping this but I decided against it.

3	Once again the sides have windows... but the back doesn't.

3	The truck is there to make the photo more worthwhile!

3	The roof to this one doesn't come off easily as all the tiles are used for the front.

3	Just to clarify; these houses aren't attached so you can arrange them however you want.

3	The fronts are quite elaborate and it seems that Lego were trying to make this almost like a simpler market street.

3	The truck is too small for a minifig... ...but it probably was my favourite car.

3	Thoughts I highly recommend this set.

3	In most countries it is good value for money, including Australia.

3	The design is excellent and three instructions are included.

3	(The third is a school.

3	If anyone has made it and wants to post photos feel free!

3	At least one person at EB has made it.)

3	I love how each house has its own car.

3	Due to the way the primary model is made it is a bit weak at the corner, but that was a design choice.

3	My only real complaint about this set is how Lego is going though a mould transition and thus some roof slopes are rough, others are smooth.

3	I can accept either, and Lego has been moving to smooth slopes for years now, but to have a set with about 50/50 is annoying.

3	(The MTT was the same.)

3	But that is my only gripe with this excellent set.

3	*wub*

3	Thanks for the review, and tons of pics!

3	I've been wanting to pick this one up since I saw it.

3	I thought the 4956 Creator House was nice, but this Model Town House is in a completely different league!

3	I also like the alternate models that you can see in the catalogues.

2	Thank you for the review Sinner.

2	At first I wanted this set for the 4 blue 1x1 slope tiles, but I can see there is much more into it than that.

2	It sure is a great value compared to what you get in the Building Bonanzas (no cars and less detail).

2	It was funny to see the little side story in your pictures.

2	Would it be hard to modify the cars to fit minifigs better?

3	A beautiful and humorous review with very fine pics.

3	*y* A fantastic set, full of neat details and in a wonderful color scheme.

3	Great for every City builder for sure.

3	I guess we waited for sets like that.

3	We dreamed about them.

3	I?m glad we got them now.

3	:'-) EDIT: Congrats!

3	It seems you?ve got your bucket back.... :-P

2	I found the use of parts well done by the designers.

2	I made a car and then tried to make a house from a different instruction book.

2	I could not as several pieces were already used in the car.

2	Nice to see them using all the parts like that rather than having a lot of "extra" bits.

2	Moral of the story: one instruction book at a time.

2	*sweet*

2	I was all for the white house until I saw this set.

2	I still wouldn't mind it though.

2	:-D Lasse D, on Sep 28 2007, 08:03 AM, said: Would it be hard to modify the cars to fit minifigs better?

2	The problem with the blue truck is a lack of headroom.

2	However the truck is quite low and I can't see it being too hard to change and still have it looking good.

2	*wub* With the exception of the ferris wheel.

2	they are all sets that you could buy 10 of and not have too many hard to use parts.

2	:'-(

3	Awesome review!

3	Luckily you have two cute little friends and one beautiful lady to help you out!

3	:-P I likewise love *wub* this set and your review does it credit!

3	I laughed outloud a lot as I read it.

3	I especially love you trying to look through the windowless back :-D :-D :-D Great job, now sort that out and start building for our competition!

3	X-D

3	Excellent review with great pics and cameo appearances by some of our EB favs *y* Definitely a set that was on my 'to get' list already, and this only confirms that.

3	Might make me want two, just because I love tan so much and I'd like to see if something could be done to bulk up that car.

3	Great job as always!

3	:-)

3	Thank you very much for the review Sinner.

3	I definitly *wub* this set.

3	This will make a great addition for us "Townies".

3	I thought the size was too small.

3	I plan to make my house fit practically the whole baseplate.

3	Plus I will definitly add floors, that looked :-D .

3	I can't believe TLC skimped on the floors.

3	Thanks for this review Sinner!

3	I love this house, with the nicely made tiled corners, the colorscheme and the garage.

3	The only thing I dislike about this set is the way the windows are attached in train windows (so they turn inwards a little) instead of the usual frames with shutter-attachment-ability.

3	But that is something that can be fixed in the blink of an eye.

3	I will certainly buy this house some day when I find it at reasonable price.

3	Thanks for the review Sinner!

3	*y* ... although we had a not very detailed one already... :-P I bought this set at TRU with 20% off resulting in 54?.

3	X-D Definitely a must buy for every townie.

3	You get tons of useful parts to build other buildings as well.

3	[shameless self-promotion /OFF] ;-) You have to love tan bricks though.

3	8-| MOC ON!

1	I too have bought this set and the only thing I notice which is a bit odd, with the exception of there being no floors in the house is the lack of a steering wheel in the car!

3	Thanks for the review Sinner!

3	I definitely want this set now.

3	The mixed rough and smooth roof bricks would annoy me on a model like the MTT, but here it looks as is if the roof is quite old with some parts being worn and pitted and some parts being replaced with new roof tiles.

3	I quite like the effect.

3	I agree on which is the best vehicle, and if it doesn't fit minifigs, just mod the heck out of it!

3	X-D

2	Thanks for the thanks guys!

2	X-D I started building today!

2	*sweet* MatthewUSA, on Sep 28 2007, 03:56 PM, said: I can't believe TLC skimped on the floors.

2	It didn't bother me as I downloaded the instructions prior to buying the set.

2	I think it was a deliberate choice to make the house flashy looking but not very functional.

2	Due to the cool looking corners it isn't very strong either; while breaking it I was reminded of a zip!

2	:-P simonwillems, on Sep 28 2007, 06:53 PM, said: The only thing I dislike about this set is the way the windows are attached in train windows (so they turn inwards a little) instead of the usual frames with shutter-attachment-ability.

2	These were my first windows like that and it surprised me.

2	I wouldn't be surprised if Lego are trying to phase out the old windows.

2	Holodoc, on Sep 28 2007, 07:58 PM, said: Thanks for the review Sinner!

2	*y* ... although we had a not very detailed one already... :-P I notice that, but since didn't show what the original set looked like I saw that more of a MOC.

2	8-| Holodoc, on Sep 28 2007, 07:58 PM, said: You get tons of useful parts to build other buildings as well.

2	[shameless self-promotion /OFF] ;-) I was actually considering adding a link to your MOC anyway.

2	Thanks!

2	:-P paul_delahaye, on Sep 29 2007, 07:38 AM, said: I too have bought this set and the only thing I notice which is a bit odd, with the exception of there being no floors in the house is the lack of a steering wheel in the car!

2	Once again, I think this is just a sign of all style, no substance!

2	:-D PaulC, on Sep 29 2007, 05:19 PM, said: The mixed rough and smooth roof bricks would annoy me on a model like the MTT, but here it looks as is if the roof is quite old with some parts being worn and pitted and some parts being replaced with new roof tiles.

2	I quite like the effect.

2	Fair point.

2	What confuses me though is the (CG) cover has the rough ones shown... :-|

3	Sinner.

3	You have convinced me.

3	I bought this set yesterday when it was on sale at International LEGO weekend in Sk?rb?k.

3	Sweet!

3	Looks like an awesome set.

3	I might get it, I have to see.

3	Looks like it has a lot of good parts.

3	-ZotS

3	Thank you for the nice review.

3	I want this set too with al those tan bricks and black slopes and the cute blue car *wub* I like the old windows more, I hope they don't stop producing them

3	Sinner, thanks for this outstanding review!

3	I am glad that I had read this review in advance, before making my purchase on this set earlier with my girlfriend.

3	We built this set for a total of 3 hours, to complete this beauty, in about 2 hours ago.

3	There are stars circling around my head at this very moment, when I post this reply.

3	I must admit from the bottom of my heart, that this is an wonderful piece of house, that simply shows the beauty of it, with the European kind of houses, where there is a garage.

3	Furthermore, there is a lovely blue car.

3	I am seeing stars right now, in the middle of the night, and I must drop a thanks to you personally as well.

3	Although it is empty from its interior unlike the 4996 Beach House, but this set has the majestic look which simply place a "Wow" factor in front of it upon completion.

3	At the moment, we had plans for getting the second set next month, to build the other design as well.

3	Hopefully, I will be able to share with you guys, all of my different Creators sets, with its alternate designs as well in the near future.

3	Nice pictorial review, I always like this little set !

3	A little more text would have been nice but that is ok as it is .

3	PS: You should have mentioned in the title that this topic is picture heavy - I was wondering why it was loading so slow on my mobile

2	Hi, You've done well on the pictures!

2	But I agree with Freekysch; a little more text would be great.

2	Ever thought about joining the Reviewer's Academy?

2	Thanks for comments.

2	I know about text, I'm trying to write more, but haven't succes in this yet.

2	I thought about joining Reviewers Academy, but I'm not sure because I have only maimum 4(may be 5) hours each time when I can make review or something that needs some hours.

2	Writing a decent review will indeed take some time.

2	But you don't need to do it in a single session.

2	If "each time" is 4/5 hours, you can write a review in 2 x "each time"

3	i actually bought this set last Monday as it was reduced to 14.99.....it actually not a bad little set considering the size and part count, has a decent array of functions.

3	its a nice little set....the B model looks just as good so i might buy a second set, as you get the bucket left over and i need that bucket for another set.

3	Edited by Richard Dower, 19 October 2015 - 04:42 PM.

3	Remember when I said in my review of 7090 to expect a review after I went to ToysRus?

3	Well, somehow things didn?t work out, but fortunately I?m finally reviewing my latest purchases, starting with 7091 Catapault Defense, which happens to be one of the best sets in the Castle line.

3	The Box and Instructions: Lego box art is at it?s highest point ever these days, with lots of special effects and great action poses.

3	The castle theme is no exception, and 7091 isn?t either.

3	I?ll let the box speak for itself: I love the back of the castle boxes as well, since they give another action scene and other neat info like a layout of all the accessories.

3	The Contents: Only the bare essentials as usual: piece bags and instructions.

3	I seriously wish they still put mini catalogs inside sets like they did when I was young, but I guess they are too expensive to make or something.

3	Ah well, can?t have everything.

3	No picture of the instructions this time, but since that isn?t necessary I?ll just say that they are fine, and do not have a problem with distinguishing dark gray from black.

3	The Pieces: Here?s your basic shot of every piece included, minus a few extra pieces like an extra Viking horn and black skeleton leg.

3	Not too shabby for a 10 USD set.

3	There?s a lot of nice pieces in 7091, as you can see (and this doesn?t include the accessories or minifig parts!).

3	The brown plates, wheels, and spoked things are always useful, and the dark blue and gold slopes are really cool.

3	However, there?s also a fair amount of technic in here, so be warry.

3	As usual for the castle line, 7091 has a heaping helping of accessories.

3	Most of them are old pieces recolored, but the ball on chain (what?s the actual name, could someone tell me?)

3	and the shields are brand new.

3	I actually like the new skeleton weapon, since it?s fairly detailed and was really the only way TLC could make a part like that.

3	And yes, the shields ARE printed (quite nicely too, if I do say so myself).

3	Plus, you get Viking horns (always useful to have), a grey boulder, a basket, and 3 helmets.

3	Not a half bad deal, eh?

3	Oh, who am I kidding ?

3	it?s awesome!

3	Minifigures: Ah yes, one of the highlights of any castle set.

3	You get 2 soldiers and 2 skellies this time, all with different weapons.

3	The two soldiers are just regular Crown troops with different faces ?

3	nothing special, except that they are awesome anyway.

3	The skeletons on the other hand are much more interesting: an archer and a black skellie!

3	Archers cool, of course, but I know many don?t like the printing on the black skeletons.

3	Well, let me say that I don?t mind it so much.

3	The only real problem is that the eyes are dark red instead of just red, which makes the printing a bit less noticeable.

3	And I?ve been through it before that the new skeleton molds in general don?t bother me at all ?

3	go skeletons!

3	The Finished Set: Alright, there?s two builds in this set, and I?ll start with the smaller: the skeleton barricade.

3	Okay, so it?s nothing special, but it?s cool all the less.

3	The shield on the front and the slanted spears are nice touches.

3	Here?s just how the skeletons can tower over their own barricade: with a little step.

3	Ah, the catapault.

3	The lovely catapault.

3	Seriously, I love TLC?s design.

3	Very effective, and also very realistic, especially compared to KK.

3	Love the side details and the swiveling base, and you gotta love the clever use of that basket.

3	Playability: Yes, I?ve made it a tradition now to write stories for any castle set I buy (and this isn?t the last one, you can be sure of that!).

3	Here?s one featuring everything in 7901: Oh, and here?s a small ship I made out of all the pieces in this set plus a couple extra figures and weapons from my copy of 7901.

3	Not half bad, IMO, considering what I had to work with.

3	Overall Rating: Presentation: 9/10 Pieces: 8/10 Minifigures: 9/10 Finished model: 9/10 Playability: 8/10 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Final Score: 8.6/10 Once again, I highly recommend the reviewed set.

3	Castle is possibly the best theme this year, and this set is one of many that prove it.

3	As with all castle sets, it?s best if you buy several if you want to truly enjoy it, but this set alone is also impressive in both design and pieces and minifigures.

3	Get at least one if you have even a slight liking for Castle.

3	Very nice review!

3	Seems like I'll be getting my first Castle set soon.. *wub* Grevious, on Oct 10 2007, 09:33 PM, said: Most of them are old pieces recolored, but the ball on chain (what’s the actual name, could someone tell me?)

3	That would be a flail.

3	;-)

3	Wow thanks for the review!

3	8-?

3	I already have the other two set (theyre fantastic *wub* ) and i know ill be getting this one soon!

3	DP8

3	Very nice review!

3	I like the amount of pics and that alternate model.

3	I wouldn't have thought of making a ship from those parts, I once made a larger, Crownie-ized skellie barrier instead.

3	A very nice review with good, although perhaps a little too big, pictures.... *y* Now I realized that this catapult?s able to swivel, that?s neat, thank you!

3	X-D

3	The pictures really tell all, nice review Grevious!

3	I especially liked the story, great sense of humor!

3	Thanks for this nice review.

3	Nice comics presentation, too.

3	*sweet* Makes me want to get some new Castle sets even harder, now.

3	:-$

3	Thanks for the review Grevious!

3	I already have this set, but I loved your comic and that nice alternate model!

3	*y* TTFN!

3	>:-)

3	That was a fun review, I picked up a couple of these on holiday in France and it was one of the main reasons I went all-out and bought the rest of the Castle range!

3	Dr. S.

3	So far of this line i have 7009 and 7090 you have now convinced me to get this one also nice review btw i think the name for it is mace

3	Great review Grevious!!

3	*sweet* *y* Nice job, thanks for sharing.

3	Great comic and I especially love that you gave us an alternative model, something LEGO neglects to do anymore... |-/ Thanks again!

3	*wub*

3	That's a superb review if I ever saw one, and another great story!

3	*y* It's a good review even though I got the set 4 months ago.

3	:-P This just reinforces my like for it.

3	:-P

3	Thanks for the review, the comic was great!

3	:-D Your alternate model is great as well, I would never have thought of building a ship out of a catapult!

3	:-P

3	Great review, this is one of my favorite sets from the new castle line.

3	It's simple and yet so effective, oh and great comic you have there *y*

3	Excellent review!

3	Showed everything in detail then added a fun twist at the end.

3	Another set I pretty much knew I needed to buy is confirmed.

3	*y*

3	nice review *y* the comic is very funny :-D i don't have this set 8-| but i'm going to buy it soon.

3	Thanks everyone for all the comments!

3	;-) My next review is most likely going to be the Toa Mahri I bought a long time ago; I also typed up a review for her but haven't bothered posting it!

3	Ah well, I'll get it up eventually.... X-D Edit: Gah!

3	I just realized how many posts I had!

3	Better post something else on the boards quickly.... :-P Edited by Grevious, 11 October 2007 - 08:45 PM.

3	LOL what a review!!!

3	I love the story ^_^

3	Ah yes, the good ol' Catapult Attack.

3	Nice review, and what a great comic, I loved it.

3	*y* :-D You've inspired me, all I need now is a camera!

3	:-P Great job, keep up the good work, and I'm looking forward to more reviews!

3	*y* ~Peace Edited by iamded, 12 October 2007 - 10:30 AM.

3	nice review, I like this set alot.

3	*y* :-)

3	Great review!

3	*sweet* I wasn't aware that the catapult rotated either...

3	This set isn't on my buy list though as it is all more of the same for me.

3	Thanks for the cool MOC!

3	:-D I always plan to add a MOC to my reviews but I always run out of time.... :'-(

3	:-D I always plan to add a MOC to my reviews but I always run out of time.... :'-( True, there are too many catapults already, and in my opinion some with a better design as well.

3	But my lack of interest in this particular set doesn't reflect at all on my opinion of this review, which I enjoyed very much!

3	Please continue making great reviews like this one Grevious.

3	*y*

3	i just got this today.

3	It is amazing like my other two castle sets: the joust and the crossbow.

3	I am currently starting to save for 2008 but for Christmas i think i want the Skeleton Carridge and the Naboo N-1 Fighter.

3	It's that time of year again when the days get shorter, the nights get colder, and children all around the world stare longingly into warmly lit toy shops and prepare their wishlist to send to Santa.

3	This is also the time when The Lego Group releases their latest Winter Village set which has been an annual tradition for the past seven years.

3	These sets have been very popular, especially among AFOLs, and are always highly anticipated.

3	However, while some entries in this series have been more popular than others, none has been as controversial as this year's set, the Winter Toy Shop, which is a re-release of the first Winter Village set, 10199 Winter Toy Shop from 2009.

3	It seems that many think that this set didn't need to be remade and would have preferred a new set instead, or that it is not different enough from the original and will be redundant in a completionist's collection.

3	Does it deserve all the hate?

3	Let's find out.

3	Disclaimer: I don't own the 2009 version, so I can't compare them visually, but I will do my best to let you know what is different in this version.

3	If you do need a visual reference, you can refer to Svelte's excellent review of the original.

3	Set Number: 10249 Name: Winter Toy Shop Theme: Creator Year of Release: 2015 Pieces: 898 Minifigs: 8 Price: £59.99 / $79.99 / 69.99€ S@H description: Quote Welcome to the Winter Toy Shop!

3	The holiday season has arrived and the toymaker is busy finishing off his latest creations!

3	Outside, children ski and snowboard, and a freshly built snowman sparkles in the light that shines from the toyshop tower.

3	Help decorate the huge tree that stands at the center of the square, play with the curious kitten on the cozy wooden bench or join in with the carolers beneath the ornate streetlamp.

3	This charming set also features a ladder, trees in various sizes, jack-in-the-box, a toy biplane, helicopter, rocket, train, race car, truck, robot, tugboat, teddy bear and a wrapped gift.

3	Have fun building this enchanting winter wonderland!

3	Includes a snowman and 8 minifigures with assorted accessories: a male caroler, female caroler, a woman, 2 men, 2 boys and a girl.

3	S@H Bricklink Brickset The Box The box art of this set is similar to that of the original, but there are some notable differences.

3	The Christmas tree is on the right side of the image this time while the park bench is on the left and of course it features this year's design for Creator boxes with the dark blue stripe along the right side and the "Expert" logo in the top right corner.

3	There's also a small picture of the back of the toy shop and the background looks less cartoony than on the original.

3	The back is also very similar, showing a different angle of the toy shop along with some close-ups, although this time there is no minifig lineup.

3	Instead, the minifig lineup is on the right side of the box.

3	It also includes the accessories that each minifig comes with and some of the toys.

3	On the left side of the box there is a thumbnail of the box art and the set name in six different languages.

3	They also want to make sure that you know that there are batteries included by saying it in dozens of languages.

3	The top of the box features the inventory and a 1:1 scale reference with the female caroler.

3	On the bottom there is a picture that reminds you that there is a light brick included in this set, in case that wasn't clear from the front of the box, and it confirms that yes, it is a bad idea to put it in water, in case you were planning to go swimming with your Winter Toy Shop.

3	The Contents Inside the box there are two instruction booklets and two groups of bags, one for each instruction booklet.

3	While two groups of bags is not as many as there usually are in other sets of this size, it's still better than the first version of this set where the bags weren't numbered at all, so this makes the build a bit easier.

3	The large bag in Group 1 and the two large bags in Group 2 have a white stripe going down the middle of the bag and only have one group number printed on it along with some other number and some kind of scan code.

3	I have no idea why they made this distinction for these bags or what that code is for, so if any of you know the purpose of this, please let me know in the comments below.

3	Here is a random instructions page.

3	As you can see, the building steps can get quite challenging as they sometimes include many different pieces in one step, especially when it uses a lot of brown pieces which are very dark and hard to see in the instructions, living up to the set's status as an expert-level set.

3	Most of the time, though, the instructions are pretty clear and easy enough to follow.

3	There are some parts in new colors in this set that weren't in the first version or any other set until now, such as that large, flat Technic arch in dark green, the jester hat in orange and blue, one of those new 2z2 round jumper tiles in brown, a golden frog(!

3	), and a snowboard in dark blue.

3	There are also some rare Friends parts that make their Creator debut here such as the skis in azure and that new clear 1x1 round tile with a tiny tube coming out of it which is usually used as a stand for Friends accessories and is a very useful piece, especially for SNOT techniques (and no, I'm not talking about the type of snot that many people usually have stuck in their nose around this time of year).

3	There are some printed parts as well, such as the clock tile, the letter tile, and the register slope like in the first version of the set.

3	We also get a new face print for the white cat which is more in line with other modern cat designs.

3	But the best part is the shop sign which is printed this time around.

3	It features a lovely wood pattern, the words "toy shop", and a toy soldier on both sides of the sign.

3	Which is ironic since the shop doesn't seem to sell any toy soldiers like this, but it looks so good on the sign that I won't sue them for false advertising.

3	The Minifigs Let's start with the most unique figures in this set, the carolers.

3	These two were also the highlight in the first version of the set, but in the original they both had the same head (this one -> ) which featured a very questionable facial expression that could easily be taken out of context.

3	In this version, they have unique faces which look much better and help distinguish their gender.

3	The male caroler uses Lord Vampyre's torso which looks quite snazzy on him.

3	Maybe this is Lord Vampyre before he became a vampire?

3	The female caroler is easily the best minifig in the set, though, because in addition to her exclusive head, she also gets an exclusive torso and skirt print!

3	A huge improvement over the generic unprinted one in the original.

3	She also gets the queen hair in dark brown and Aragorn's lined cape instead of two combined regular capes.

3	This set truly is the Return of the Queen!

3	The snowman is technically not a minifig, but as you can see here, he is exactly as tall as one and he is the first thing you build after the minifigs, so I included him here.

3	He has mostly the same design as before, except this time he has robot claws for arms instead of levers.

3	Which is good since they allow him to hold accessories such as his broom.

3	His carrot nose is included separately again.

3	The carolers both have back printing while the snowman looks no different from the back than he does from the front.

3	Here you can see the black side of the female's cape.

3	This lined cape is so much nicer than the solution they used in the original.

3	Next up we have what I assume is a married couple who are likely the parents of at least one of the kids, as well as the toymaker who I will call Geppetto.

3	The man in the pinstripe suit was not included in the first version of the set, so he's a bonus minifig!

3	These guys are fairly generic, but they have some detailed torso prints, so they look pretty nice.

3	Geppetto seems to have gotten younger since the release of the original set since his gray hair has now turned dark tan and he doesn't seem to need glasses anymore.

3	The men both have back printing, but the woman is the only one in this set who doesn't get a back print.

3	Why you gotta be so discriminating against women, LEGO?!

3	Last but not least, there are the kids.

3	One of the boys wears dark blue pants, a green jacket, and a wool cap.

3	He looks a bit like a lumberjack, so let's call him lumberjack boy, or Jack for short.

3	The little girl wears an outfit that wouldn't look out of place in the Friends theme with a lavender scarf and pants.

3	I'll call her Lavender.

3	The second boy is wearing an Octan jacket and a sports helmet which makes it ironic that he is the one not doing any winter sports on the box art.

3	I'll call him President Business Junior, or PBJ for short.

3	All of the kids have fairly detailed back printing which makes up for the fact that much like the adults, they are made out of mostly common parts.

3	PBJ's helmet and scarf cover up the back of his head nicely which is important as you will see in the next picture.

3	What's also great about these figs is that half of them have a double-sided head.

3	Here you can see PBJ doing his best Macaulay Culkin impression.

3	I also removed his scarf so you can see the printing on his torso better.

3	But he's not the only one who seems to be easily scared.

3	The mother also has a very alarmed expression.

3	Maybe she got surprised by the Jack-in-the-box or maybe she just realized how expensive toys are nowadays.

3	You can see the female caroler's back printing here.

3	Her alternate expression is a non-singing face which is very nice to have and I wish the male caroler could have one too.

3	She looks quite cute with those rosy cheeks.

3	But the most adorable out of all of them has to be the little girl.

3	She comes with a pouting sad face that will melt your heart.

3	Please, don't cry!

3	I'll buy you any toy you want, just stop looking at me like that!

3	The Build The first half of the build is dedicated to the surroundings of the toy shop.

3	It includes the Christmas tree, the park bench, the snowman, the toys, the carolers, Jack and Lavender.

3	The large bag contains two smaller bags with small pieces, a white box that contains the caroler's cape, and the jester hat in its own little bag.

3	The first thing you build after the minifigs and the snowman is the toys.

3	This version of the set has a lot more toys than the original which is good because I always felt that the first Toy Shop was a bit light on toys.

3	Also, the ones that were in the original have been updated.

3	For example, instead of the two pairs of skis, you now get one pair of skis that use the new ski mold and a snowboard.

3	The Jack-in-the-box is mostly the same, except it now has an orange and blue color scheme instead of the red and blue from the original.

3	This change was probably not necessary, but hey, at least we get a new jester hat out of it.

3	And instead of the brick-built teddy bear you get the new teddy bear mold.

3	I have mixed feelings about this change because I actually kinda liked the brick-built teddy design and using a specialized mold seems to be going against the spirit of Creator sets, but on the other hand I can't deny that the molded teddy looks better than the blocky old one.

3	Meh.

3	The new toys include a tugboat which has some rounded Technic pieces as its hull, a biplane, a rocket, a helicopter, and a truck that cleverly uses roller skates for its wheels.

3	These are all quite brilliant designs that feel like micro versions of Lego City sets and make a great addition to the set.

3	Here is a back view of some of the more complex models.

3	As you can see, the Friends accessory stand has been cleverly used to hold the biplane's fin in place and to provide a stand for the helicopter.

3	The Jack-in-the-box has a hinged lid.

3	The only thing that bugs me a bit is the T-piece on top of the helicopter that holds the rotor in place, but I can't think of any better way they could have done it.

3	Next is the ladder that is used to decorate the tree which is exactly the same as the first version.

3	The supports are on a click-hinge, so they can be adjusted or folded away.

3	Then, you build the tree itself.

3	You begins, of course, with the stand which is mostly the same design as before, but this time the plates at the bottom are brown instead of white and have golden studs as feet.

3	Next, you build the first layer of branches.

3	The main difference in this version of the tree is that this one actually has a brown stem rather than just a Technic axle on which you stack the layers of branches one by one.

3	You wont be able to see the stem in the final result, but I like this change as it makes the tree more realistic.

3	Then you add the second layer of branches.

3	This one doesn't have lights/candles and attaches to the lower layer at an angle using the four trans-yellow studs close to the stem.

3	The third layer is added.

3	This one has lights again.

3	Each layer is similar in that they are all made out of green plates that are built around a 4x4 ring plate, but they get smaller each time and are constructed differently enough for the build not to feel repetitive.

3	With the addition of the fourth layer, we get close to finishing the tree.

3	Lastly, you add one more layer and the tip of the tree.

3	Now it's time to decorate the tree!

3	However, it's not as fun as it sounds since that requires you to add lights to the two chains/ropes first which can get a bit repetitive.

3	The clips holding the lights to the chain were white, but this time they're pearl gold which looks much nicer in my opinion.

3	The next part of the build is the park bench with the streetlamp and the little tree.

3	This is a fairly quick build with not much to it.

3	The fishbowl helmet parts are a useful piece that you don't see too often, so it's nice to get them again in this remake.

3	The design is pretty much the same as in the original set except for the wreaths on the streetlamp which use a green life preserver instead of a round 2x2 plate.

3	This is another instance where they use a specialized piece instead of a brick-built solution, but I'm okay with that because unlike with the teddy bear, this part was not originally intended to be a wreath, so it's still nice part usage.

3	The second half of the build is dedicated to the toy shop itself and includes the couple, Geppetto, and PBJ.

3	Please note that there is a fourth 6x10 plate burried under the parts.

3	You begin by tiling the floor, setting up the walls, and adding the interior items such as the fireplace, the cash register, and the toy displays.

3	Next, you add the walls, windows, and the door and the ground floor of the shop is finished.

3	So far, the build is the same as the old toy shop, except this time they decided to have the white stripes on the marquees be the longer ones instead of the dark red ones for some reason.

3	I don't know why they did this and kinda would have preverred to get dark red 1x1 plates instead of white, but it doesn't detract from the look of the shop, so I don't really care.

3	Now we begin with the upper floor.

3	This is where things start to look a little different.

3	Can you tell the difference?

3	The difference is that this time they attach the roof using clip-hinges instead of bulky Technic constructions which gives you more space on this floor and allows it to look more like an actual attic.

3	They even tile the floor next to the frog clock.

3	Aftter adding the roof, the build is finished.

3	The main roof feels a bit loose since it's only attached to the building by one side.

3	I'm not sure if this was an issue in the old toy shop, but it's not a big deal.

3	I just wouldn't pick the set up by the roof.

3	What I do like is that they used double cheese slopes on the awning on the outer wall of the tower instead of singles which makes it a bit easier to build.

3	I like how the supports under the tower roof now match those of the main roof.

3	The wreaths have also been updated like the ones on the streetlamp.

3	And those Technic arches under the roof look a lot more like garlands now.

3	On the original, they were dark gray, so I didn't even know they were supposed to be garlands and assumed they were part of the architecture.

3	The shop sign looks a lot better now that it is printed.

3	The old one just looked like a white flag.

3	I also like how the small plates under the marquee give it a wavy look and they included two trees in different sizes on the right side of the shop.

3	The back is nice and open and allows you to see the rest of the toys, the robot, train, and race car, all of which have just as much of a simple and clever design as the other toys.

3	The clock looks much nicer with the new golden frog.

3	Because golden frogs make everything better.

3	Spare Parts There are quite a few small parts left over, including a roller skate and one of those Friends accessory stands which will come in handy.

3	The Complete Set Here you can see the full set together.

3	It looks quite nice and festive with all the little details and there are many scenes that you can play out with it: You can have the minifigs decorate the tree, have the kids play in the snow, have the carolers sing by the bench, have the toymaker build some toys in his workshop, or have the parents buy presents for their kids.

3	It's a festive, toy-filled Winter Wonderland!

3	The fireplace looks cozy and I like the brick pattern going up the chimney.

3	The entrance of the shop looks a bit empty aside from the cash register.

3	I feel like they could have displayed some more toys here, but oh well.

3	Being a set targeted at teens and adults, there aren't really any play features aside from the light brick which is attached to a hinge, so you can either activate it by pressing the button with your finger or tilting the brick upward so that the button is pressed against the roof.

3	However, since the roof is not connected in the middle and only attached on the sides, it tends to split open a bit when you do that, so I'm not sure if attaching the roof this way here was such a good idea.

3	Nevertheless, it looks quite nice when the light is lit.

3	Ratings Design: 5/5 - This set is as gorgeous as it was back in 2009!

3	The small updates that they made are mostly good ones, although the absence of a brick-built teddy is a bit disappointing and the new way the roof is attached, while not as bulky as before, makes the roof slightly unstable, but those are just nitpicks.

3	Build: 5/5 - There are some interesting building techniques here, such as those on the tree, the roof, and the toys.

3	The fact that the parts are only split into two groups and the part callouts can get fairly complex makes it a challenging, enjoyable build.

3	Minifigs: 5/5 - They did a great job updating the figs in this set.

3	While only 3 of the torsos in the original had any printing, all of the torsos have printing front and back in this set, even the skirt and cape of the female caroler.

3	You get two exclusive heads and half of the heads are double-sided, plus you get 8 instead of 7 minifigs.

3	You really can't ask for more in a Creator set.

3	Playability: 4/5 - This set is more meant to be displayed than to be played with, but there are plenty of things to play with if you want.

3	All the different minifigs, accessories, and set pieces make for endless possibilities for play.

3	It's especially fun to swoosh the micro vehicles around.

3	Parts: 3/5 - There are lots of good parts here.

3	Most of them are fairly common, but there are some rare parts and some even in exclusive colors.

3	Price: 4/5 - This set costs $20 more than the original, but considering that this set has nearly 900 pieces, including some rare and exclusive ones, as well as more minifigs with much better printing, I think $80 is still a fair price.

3	Overall: 5/5 - So what's my opinion of this set?

3	For a remake, I think it's great.

3	They managed to make a good set even better.

3	Are the changes minor?

3	Yes.

3	Are they an improvement?

3	Mostly, yes.

3	Were they necessary?

3	Perhaps not, but it's good that they made them instead of just re-releasing the exact same set.

3	So if you didn't get the first Winter Toy Shop, I can highly recommend getting this one.

3	If you do already have the old version, this one might still be worth picking up for the hugely improved minifigs and rare parts alone.

3	As for the controversy over re-releasing the Winter Toy Shop, I can see where the haters are coming from, but I find their complaints to be quite petty.

3	I can understand if you're disappointed because you already have the first Winter Toy Shop and were looking forward to a new set this year, but there's always next year.

3	If you're a completist and feel like TLG is forcing you to buy a set you don't need, you're wrong.

3	Nobody is forcing you to buy anything but yourself.

3	If you decide to buy every set in a theme no matter what it is, that's your problem, not LEGO's.

3	So put down your torches and pitchforks and just be glad that they improved the set design and gave us another chance to buy this classic set.

3	There are far worse things that can happen in this world than Lego re-releasing one of their most popular sets.

3	Sorry for that little rant.

3	So what is your opinion on re-releases like this?

3	Please cast your vote in the poll above.

3	I hope you enjoyed this special Eurobricks Reviewers Academy review and would like to thank The Lego Group for the opportunity to review this set.

3	Happy Holidays everyone!

3	Bat-Toys by Okay Yaramanoglu, on Flickr

3	Thanks for a great review first of all.

3	I do like the upgrades and changes made from the original 2009 set, more colours and parts are offcourse available today than back in 2009.

3	It does look like a great set and i would really realy have loved to get it myself if i had the funds.

3	However their are so many other sets thats first priority for me this december and next year, so sadly i might have to pass on this if its not that i can get it redicioulusly cheap at some point.

3	And yeah, we should appreciate that LEGO does keep sets coming, even if its just upgrades from earlier releases.

3	Town is known for a new police and fire station every year, cant see why a new toyshop is so upsetting.

3	Once again thanks for a great review.

3	And happy holidays to you as well.

3	Nice to see they finally updated that generic screaming face from the 2007 Castle line.

3	Awesome review, Oky.

3	I have the old set so I won't be picking this up.

3	Great review.

3	You almost make me want to buy one.

3	I don't know what it is with these sets.

3	On the one hand they are so nicely designed and cute on the other side I never seriously consider buying one.

3	I can't explain what it is that holds me back.

2	Great review!

2	I just built the original, and this one has clear advantages over the original (though I wish Lego would stop putting torsos with defined breasts and curves on children).

2	I really like pretty much every change.

2	I won't be getting it, and I'd be lying if I said I'm not a little disappointed.

2	For the first four years, my mother-in-law got me the new winter village set for Christmas; after the last two, which didn't really fit thematically in my display, I had hoped for a new one--particularly since my daughter is getting to be around the age where she can play with them.

2	I mention her specifically because I've seen lots of people dismiss those who are a bit disappointed as rabid adults who don't care about kids getting cool sets, and I don't think that's fair.

2	I may have to see how much some of the parts go for on Bricklink.

2	The rerelease is better than the original, but not good enough that I'd want to spend $80 to get a set that's nearly identical to one I have.

2	A lack of money, maybe?

2	That's the thing that usually holds me back.

2	Anyway, I have the older version, so I am not interested in this set.

2	Great review, thanks Oky!

2	IMO, the only significant improvements over the 2009 version are the figures, toys, and printed shop sign.

2	As I already have the older one I'll have to give this one a pass.

3	Regarding the reason for the different designs on the inner bags, I think that the white stripe is the new version, with the non-stripe version being old.

3	I suspect the reason some sets have both versions is simply that they're still using up some of their supply of older bags.

3	Good review.

3	I didn't realise there were quite as many changes as you highlighted (tree, roof etc).

1	Thanks for the excellent review!

1	Unfortunately it only highlights how minimal the upgrades are (though they are nice).

1	Definitively a pass for me.

1	Let's hope LEGO does continue to make the more realistic winter village sets (versus Santa).

1	I'm not opposed to a rehash, the post office could use some improvements for example, but this one is just a wee bit minimal.

3	I missed out on the first one, but I love the improvements made in this version, like the tree having an actual brown trunk so it looks less like an artificial one, and the carolers as well.

3	I may pick this up, but I'm sorry to those of you who already have one.

3	I bought it and I'm very happy with it.

2	Cheers for putting up the review.

2	Some nice improvements, but not enough for me to pick it up.

2	The original set is good enough for me.

2	Pity the poll has no option "Yes, but only in addition to new sets, not in stead of new sets".

2	Edited by Withacee, 01 December 2015 - 09:38 AM.

3	Thanks for a nice review.

3	I am building it as we speak, and I like it so far.

3	Since I didn't have the old one, I can't complain.

2	Thanks for the review.

2	They definitely improved upon the original, but since I already own the original, I can't justify this set also, unfortunately.

2	It seems to be the trend.

2	But I'm sure there are a lot of first timers out there too that will snatch this up since it is a really lovely building.

2	And the updates make it better for sure.

2	Thanks Oky for this fine review.

2	I agreed with your sentiments on the unnecessary rants.

2	I also owned the 2009 version and even though there are minor improvements.

2	There must be a logical reason for its release again but is not entirely the same.

2	I felt is an excellent opportunity for others to acquire this design especially after six years ago.

2	As for myself, I will probably buy this if my spare funds allow me to own this set.

2	After mocking people for holding a particular opinion, you then turn around and ask people to express their opinion??

2	No thanks.

2	I guess I'll keep my opinions to myself.

2	I certainly don't want to be labeled a "hater."

2	Thanks for the kind comments everyone!

2	I like hearing your opinions on this set.

2	Withacee, on 01 December 2015 - 09:37 AM, said: Pity the poll has no option "Yes, but only in addition to new sets, not in stead of new sets".

2	I don't think that would be a realistic option as that would mean that they would have to spend twice the resources on this theme which I don't think they are ready to do, but if more people would like this option, I can add it to the poll.

2	I'm not mocking anyone.

2	I just think that some people need to calm down a bit and that TLG is getting more hate than they deserve for this set, but that's just my opinion and you're welcome to disagree with it.

2	Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, including you and me.

2	And yes, I would love to hear your thoughts on this matter because I would like to have a friendly discussion on this subject.

2	I know, but one can always hope, can't one!

2	I hope the WV theme will be continued in coming years with new sets, but given Santa's workshop and this re-release, I don't get my hopes up too much.

2	Time to get MOCing and reverse engineering!

3	I didn't own the original toy shop so I bought it this time around.

3	I just finished building it Saturday and I love it!

3	However, I wish they had both re-released this one AND came out with a new addition to the village.

3	:)

2	That's cool, and I appreciate that.

2	But, i would recommend avoiding the use of the word "hater" then.

2	That's a perjorative term that's loaded with negative connotation, as I'm sure you're well aware.

2	It's the flipside to me calling you a "mindless fanboy" or a "corporate shill."

2	Those aren't terms that invite friendly discussion.

2	They shut down discussion by belitting the other person's opinion, and implying that they lack the maturity or intelligence to think critically.

2	I don't actually care all that much about this set.

2	You just hit on a pet peeve of mine, is all.

2	And it's one that I see spreading throughout Eurobricks, which is a shame.

2	The use of terms like "hater," "whiner," or "fanboy" are becoming much too prevalent around here.

3	REVIEW - 42044 - DISPLAY TEAM JET INTRODUCTION The smallest of the 2016 sets, is the Display Team Jet.

3	It doesn't seem to have lots of functionality, but maybe the landing gear is retractable.

3	This set kind of reminds me to the 9394 - Jet Plane, although it's obviously a lot smaller.

3	As you can read in my review of the 42052 - Heavy Lift Helicopter basically anything flying is +1 for me, so let's find out if this set also fits the bill.

3	Note: All images can be clicked for hi-res versions.

3	SET INFORMATION Number: 42044 Title: Display Team Jet Theme: Technic Released: 2016 Part Count: 113 Box Weight: 193 gr Box Dimensions: 15,4 cm x 13,8 cm x 5,9 cm Set Price (MSRP): € 9,99 Price per Part: € 0,088 Links: Brickset, Bricklink THE BOX Being a small set, it obviously comes in a small box.

3	The Display Team Jet is an Aerobatics Jet, used in air shows.

3	On the box it's flying rather high, but at least it's at a safe distance from the crowd.

3	Front side shows the main model, together with a small section indicating you can use Digital Building instructions to build this model.

3	BACK SIDE The back side shows the B-model, a Stunt Plane.

3	And again a reference to the apps for Digital Building instructions.

3	More on the Stunt Plane later.

3	CONTENT OF THE BOX The box contains: 2 Instructions Booklets (A- and B-model) 1 Sticker Sheet 3 Technic Liftarms 2 Bags INSTRUCTION BOOKLETS Both the instructions for the A- and B-model are included in the box.

3	STICKER SHEET A lot of stickers for such a small set.

3	Apparently no panel is left untouched.

3	LIFTARMS Three liftarms unsealed, nothing out of the ordinary for a small set.

3	BAGS Two bags containing the rest of the parts.

3	HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This section describes the new and/or otherwise interesting parts.

3	YELLOW 5L AXLES The 5L Axle in Yellow has never been released before, so it's one of the new parts for this year.

3	BLACK 7L FLEX AXLES For the layman this seems a common part, but the 7L Soft Axle actually has never been released in black before.

3	Combined with the re-release of the 19L Soft Axle in black, this will open up lots of possibilities.

3	For those of you thinking you've read this text before; you are right, the new Drag Racer contains these new 7L Flex Axles too.

3	WHITE PANELS This small set comes with a whopping 10 panels.

3	Great for the ones who like panels.

3	Not so great if you think TLG is using too much panels lately.

3	RUDDER This part, the Small Bionicle Wing, is the same as the one used in last year's 42033 - Record Breaker.

3	PART LIST This set contains 113 parts, all listed below.

3	THE BUILD This is the collection of parts, used to build the Jet.

3	It sure looks like we are getting a landing gear.

3	The build is fun, but pretty straightforward.

3	There aren't any special or cool techniques used in this set.

3	It almost took me more time to apply all the stickers than to build the actual model.

3	FINISHED MODEL The finished Jet does look cool though.

3	The white and yellow color scheme, combined with the stickers, work really well.

3	I have seen people refer to the plane as being orange, but it's definitely yellow.

3	Technic (or LEGO in general) tends to have some color variation when it comes to yellow.

3	I do concur this is the warmer variant of yellow, but it's not orange.

3	The back of the plane looks nice too, although I am not a big fan of the rudder part.

3	It looks too detailed, compared to the other panels.

3	It's not a big deal though, and maybe it's just me.

3	PARTS LEFT Only three common parts left.

3	FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS This set has a single feature and that is a retractable landing gear.

3	It's operated by the black 12T Double Bevel Gear near the cockpit.

3	In the following picture you can see the landing gear retracted.

3	This image shows the landing gear when the plane is ready for landing.

3	Hopefully the pilot will roll the plane before landing, but you probably know what I mean VIDEO Here's s short video demonstrating the Display Team Jet.

3	B-MODEL This set also includes the building instructions for the B-model, a Stunt Plane.

3	The building experience for the Stunt Plane is more or less the same as for the Jet.

3	Well, what do you expect when both models are planes with a limited number of parts.

3	For an alternative model the Stunt Plane looks fine.

3	There's not a lot of functionality in this plane, but it's worth mentioning that the tail wheel allows the plane to roll on a flat surface.

3	The plane also has working propellors.

3	Both functions are demonstrated in the video.

3	Unfortunately, the landing gear of the Stunt Plane is not retractable.

3	PARTS LEFT A couple of extra leftover parts, but it's nice to see that most of the parts have been used in the B-model as well.

3	Actually, there's probably an extra yellow Technic Smooth 1/2 Bush left.

3	I just found it on my desk, but it could belong to one of the other sets.

3	VIDEO Here's a video demonstrating the Stunt Plane.

3	SUMMARY Two nice planes for 13 bucks, that's basically what you get.

3	Both models look good and the set has some interesting new parts.

3	Especially the 7L Flex Axle will be very popular.

3	It comes with a decent collection of white panel, although they are very common nowadays.

3	Both models have limited functionality, but each of them has at least one function to give the model some playability for kids, other than the swooshability that is.

3	Okay, it might lack some proper functions, but I still think kids will love this set.

3	I can see kids running around with one of the planes in their hands.

3	All in all I think this set delivers what you'd expect.

3	SCORE Let's see how this set flies!

3	Remember that the grades are based on it being a small set.

3	Obviously a set like this, cannot be compared with a Mercedes flagship.

3	8 DESIGN For a small set, the model looks very authentic.

3	7 BUILDING EXPERIENCE No surprises.

3	7 FEATURES Just the retractable landing gear.

3	8 PLAYABILITY It has swooshability, so I see kids running around with this model.

3	7 PARTS Lots of panels, if you are into that.

3	8 VALUE FOR MONEY Can't go wrong with these small sets.

3	7,5 FUN FOR KIDS More image can be found on my Flickr page.

3	Thank you for reading.

3	I hope you enjoyed it.

1	While I can see kids enjoying this, I'm not sure I would buy.

1	The flex axles are nice, and it is a decent number of white panels but I think I would get better return out of a larger parts set.

1	Fantastic review though, and your pictures show off this tiny model better than the box art does.

3	Very nice little set, and a lot of those new white small panels.

3	It's a need!

3	Thanks for the nice review!

3	The landing mechanism looks quite cute.

3	Aren't the yellow axles 5L, not 4L?

3	(Very strange that they would release such a part).

2	It says 5l in the parts list.

3	Love this model, awesome swooshability, interesting parts, and a nice little model to put on my desk at work :)

3	For 10 Euros very usefull parts.

3	I like it as well as other 2016 sets.

3	I like the gear retracting mechanism a lot.

3	Very good set for good price.

3	Thanx for good review.

3	:) Max

3	Hi there, nice model, great review!

3	I almost reverse engineered this model, but used wrong parts for landing wheels, didn't know how to fix the nose proper, and so on.

3	So i was very interested in this model and i like playing with it.

3	I love the reviews, but i think i have to mention, that the yellow axle must be a 5L!

3	The picture shows a 5L, and a 5L would fit the size of the model.

3	The cart has also a 5L in yellow.

3	What sitze is the yellow axle in this seit.

3	Really 4L as written in the text?

3	Greetings, Robert

2	Greetings, Robert The picture of the manual says 4x 5L yellow axle, and that seems to line up with what im seeing in the pics as well So i assume the 4L is a typo

2	I seem to have been messing up Axle Lengths in various reviews It's indeed 5L.

2	My bad.

2	Thanks for pointing it out.

3	Very nice review for a nice little set!

3	I especially like the smoothness of operation for the retractable landing gear.

3	I don't like the lack of symmetry for the propeller of the B model though, but understand the alternative would be to add one extra small panel to the set, or skip two of them in the B model.

3	Good review, as always Jim When I first saw this set I thought that it would make a great parts pack for me, as that I have about 20 white pieces in my Technic collection (all from 42043) and this set has some really useful ones, all for a cheap price.

3	Those 7L flex axles will be extremely useful in my current build I'm doing

3	Nice review, even with the missing demonstration video of the A-model!

3	Looks like this is an excellent panel pack for the price, and those soft axles will go down a treat.

3	Will this set be the dark horse of 1H 2016...?

3	I am definitely getting set for the panels!

2	Set is only interesting for the panels, that's all it is to me

3	I just built the A model, and I rather like it.

3	It is much bigger than it looks from the box - about 30 studs long.

3	There is only one function - the landing gear - but it works very nicely.

3	Apart from that, it's a very solid build, and achieves an elegant shape with an absolute minimum of parts.

3	I don't usually get excited about small sets, but this one appeals to me.

3	I like the feeling that every single piece has a purpose.

3	My favourite of the 2016 sets I've built so far.

3	I'd go so far as to say this is the best "budget" set in years.

3	I would have loved this when I was a kid ... great "swoosh ability" ?

3	?

3	Good to hear that, im gonna check the toy shops in my lunch break tomorrow, see if they got their shipment in yet, if they have, ill definitely buy one of these little sets

2	I got this little set for Xmas and I noticed all the gaps and decided to fix them, so here it is.

2	IMG_5344 by JJ2Sam, on Flickr First I added some beams to the wings and top to make it less hollow, second I put some navigation lights on it, I made the nose a bit wider and added a control panel, and lastly I changed out the landing gear wheels to more appropriate ones.

2	IMG_5349 by JJ2Sam, on Flickr More pictures are HERE

3	Thats a cool little mod, two small nigles though, 1, your navigation lights are flipped on the main wings, 2, the panels on the tail i *think* were supposed to be the intakes for the jet engine, by using them to close up the tail you've turned it into a glider Cant wait untill i find one of these on shelves!

3	So this set showed up in stores yesterday, and i immediately picked two up.

3	All in all it is a nice set, but it is slightly different from what i was expecting, the plane feels a bit "flat", pointy nose, wide bottom etc.. And while the panels work very well as wings, it feels a bit simplistic to just have single-part wings.

3	The stickers really work for it though.

3	Its a cracking set though, nice parts pack, and a nice model as well

3	Got this at the weekend, mainly for the parts, but built it first.

3	Agreed with other comments - awesome swooshability.

3	REVIEW - 42046 - GETAWAY RACER INTRODUCTION Starting with the 42010 - Off-road Racer and 42011 - Race Car in 2013, TLG released two sets in the first half of each year, using a pullback motor.

3	The pullback motor allows the model to be pulled back, followed by forward motion.

3	Usually there's no apparent relation between the two set, other than the ability to combine them into an alternate build.

3	This year there seems to some sort of Cops and Robbers scene going on.

3	A Getaway Racer and a Police Interceptor.

3	That can't be a coincidence.

3	Makes you wonder who will be victorious, the good guys or the bad guys.

3	Let's find out!

3	Note: All images can be clicked for hi-res versions.

3	SET INFORMATION Number: 42046 Title: Getaway Racer Theme: Technic Released: 2016 Part Count: 170 Box Weight: 302 gr Box Dimensions: 26,0 cm x 13,8 cm x 5,9 cm Set Price (MSRP): € 19,99 Price per Part: € 0,118 Links: Brickset, Bricklink THE BOX The box has the same dimensions as previous year's pullback motor sets.

3	In the lower right corner there's a visual explanation of the pullback mechanism.

3	The dark model with it's decals sure looks like a cool hot rod.

3	CONTENT OF THE BOX The box contains: 1 Instructions Booklet 1 Sticker Sheet 2 Technic Liftarms 1 Pullback Motor 3 Bags INSTRUCTION BOOKLET Just a single booklet.

3	Unfortunately no booklet for the alternate model.

3	STICKER SHEET The sticker sheet contains a lot of cool stickers with flames and skulls etc.

3	PULLBACK MOTOR AND LIFTARMS The pullback motor and two liftarms are found unbagged.

3	BAGS A total of three bags containing the majority of the parts.

3	HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This section describes the new and/or otherwise interesting parts.

3	Actually, this set is the only set of 1H 2016 which doesn't use any new parts, not even parts in a new color.

3	TIRES The Getaway Racer uses four low profile tires (Tire 37 x 22 ZR).

3	RIMS The rims are Wheel 30.4mm D. x 20mm in Pearl Gold, found in 12 other sets.

3	PANELS This set contains three #3 Panelsand three #4 Panels in black.

3	PART LIST This set contains 171 parts, all listed below.

3	THE BUILD This being a small model, I won't show any building steps.

3	Let's skip right to the finished model.

3	Below you can see the end result.

3	In my opinion the model looks great.

3	It's got that hot rod vibe going on and the stickers add darkness to the vibe.

3	Slight problem with this set is that it really needs the stickers to finish the look.

3	Otherwise it's quite dull, with black and dark grey liftarms and panels.

3	The rear view shows the pullback motor connected directly to the rear axle.

3	In this image you can also clearly see the exhaust pipes on the side, which are very well executed.

3	The 3x3 Technic Discs with stickers, used in the rim, result in only seeing a part of the rim.

3	This works very well with the golden rims.

3	The bottom view shows the chassis of the car.

3	Nothing really noteworthy, as you would expect from a pullback set.

3	VIDEO The following video gives you an overview of the finished model.

3	PARTS LEFT These six parts are left after building the model.

3	Seems about right.

3	FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS This being a pullback motor set, it only has a single feature.

3	The video below demonstrates the acceleration of the vehicle.

3	My girlfriend was kind enough to catch the model before it fell to the ground.

3	Or did it hit something before it fell to the ground?!

3	VIDEO This video shows the pullback functionality.

3	B-MODEL The alternate model is a combined build with the Police Interceptor, which you can see on the back of the box.

3	Unfortunately the instructions for the combined B-model are not included, so I didn't get a chance to build it.

3	This would make for a fun challenge, building the B-model without the instructions.

3	SUMMARY Pullback sets are not the most technically advanced models, so you can't expect any other functionality than hitting the walls in your house.

3	However, I think they are very appealing to kids.

3	The fact that this year's pullback sets form a duo adds to the fun.

3	In my opinion TLG hit the nail on the head with the Getaway Racer and Police Interceptor.

3	The Getaway Racer looks very badass, which is something you don't see every day in a Technic set.

3	SCORE How do I grade the bad guy in this year's duo.

3	8 DESIGN It looks so cool, but it does need the stickers.

3	7 BUILDING EXPERIENCE Nothing out of the ordinary.

3	7 FEATURES Limited to the pullback-and-drive functionality.

3	7 PLAYABILITY Combined with the Police Interceptor, kids will love it.

3	It does need it's Nemesys though.

3	7 PARTS Collection of common parts.

3	Gold rims could be interesting.

3	8 VALUE FOR MONEY Pullback sets always deliver a certain value.

3	7,3 HIT IT!

3	More image can be found on my Flickr page.

3	Thank you for reading.

3	I hope you enjoyed it.

3	I almost purchased this today because I like the wheel / disc combo so much.

3	Another great review Jim!

3	And again i love the model, those pearl gold wheels This one definitely goes on the "buy on sight" list

2	One hero will now have just enough of that pullback motor to create one ultimate machine, thanks to this.

2	Jim great reviews but can I suggest you one thing?

2	Take some pics before you apply the stickers....and some with the stickers on!

2	It helps to have a comparison!

2	You are right.

2	I came to the same conclusion when writing the review.

2	I tell you it doesn't look that good without stickers, but I don't have a picture to prove it.

2	To be honest; I compared it to the model posted in the 2016 topic a few days ago.

2	I applied the stickers before building the model, so I wasn't able to make a proper comparison.

2	I will keep it in mind for future reviews.

2	Thanks for the suggestion.

2	You're welcome!

2	I'm not a huge fan of stickers, for 2 reasons: I do re-use all the parts normally...and also I believe a model should look great even without stickers, then obviously they can be a plus, but only afterwords!

2	Anyway I'm enjoying the reviews as usual, and those pics Thanks for making them Jim!

2	!

2	Cool!

2	Glad you like 'em.

2	And thanks for the kind words.

1	Not sure what people like about this set, I think it's the worst of all 1H2016 sets.

1	Odd shape, bland colors, no new parts, and the windscreen isn't even closed.

1	But the reviews are great, indeed.

1	:)

2	are parts #62462 in Flat or Metallic Silver?

2	First thing I thought: HOT WHEELS??

2	WHUT.

2	The set looks like the Hot Wheels 'Bone Shaker'.

3	What a nice, tight an clean design!

3	Usually not too keen on the pull-back models, but this one is great.

2	the instructions for the Extreme Police Interceptor combo model is now online....will someone do a review of this B model?

2	I am not sold on this one yet, but I confess it took about 2 years for me to finally appreciate 9396.

2	Maybe I need to see this in person.

3	Thanks for the review.

3	I wonder if the design inspiration came from the Russian Ka-32 helicopter.

2	I wonder if the design inspiration came from the Russian Ka-32 helicopter.

2	It sure seems that way.

3	Lego 42049 Mine Loader Thanks to Lego and EuroBricks for making this review possible!

3	This was supposed to be a preview-review, before the Dec 1 release date for the set, but it got stuck in customs or something and didn't arrive in time.

3	Well, I'd rather do a good, late review than a rushed review, so here it is.

3	Name: Mine Loader Set Number: 42049 Pieces: 476 (I think) Price: $39.99 (I think) Minifigs: 0 Theme: Technic Year of Release: 2016 Links: Bricklink Brickset The Box Another standard Technic box, not that there's anything wrong with that.

3	It is a littler weird that the mine loader is shown OUTSIDE the mine, but whatever.

3	The Back of the Box Again, very standard.

3	It's oddly technical, showing the exact angle of the machine when turning, but that's the sort of nerdy detail that Technic people like.

3	The alternate Mine Cutting Machine model looks interesting and unusual as well.

3	The 1:1 Part The 1:1 part on the top of the box is especially helpful with this set.

3	These mining machines are very oddly proportioned, since they need to fit in mine tunnels, so it's hard to judge the model size based on the wheels or seat like you can an ordinary set.

3	The Contents You get manuals for both models (a single book for the B and two books for the main), a medium size sticker sheet, 4 bags, and 4 loose tires.

3	The Special Parts This set has 4 of the new mudguard panels in yellow, two cylinder halves in red (a new color), some of the new color red and yellow axles, a couple of the new-ish Technic spacers, some of the axle-pin combination pieces, and a couple swords!

3	I'm pretty sure that's "an antenna" and a spare.

3	The Start of the B-Model Since I like the main model better, I'm building the alternate first, so that's how I'll write the review.

3	There's "power" for something (probably the engine) being taken off the one axle here.

3	Overall, a pretty standard Technic frame beginning with some structural beams, a frame, and using liftarms to support axles out to the sides.

3	More of the Frame The far end of the model has some obvious steering mechanism being formed, as well as a pivoting arm right in the center that's probably the connection from the Hand of God knob.

3	The Steering Yup.

3	Called it.

3	Oddly, there is a different turning radius between right and left right now.

3	I wonder if that'll get fixed... More Mechanisms That's looking more Technic now.

3	Sad to see a u-joint being used just as a fixed straight connection like that, but it is the alternate model...

3	The Engine Block Because all engines should be enclosed in a red cylindrical housing, am I right?

3	The Chassis It's definitely coming together now.

3	And yes, the B-model instructions tell you to put the stickers on.

3	It doesn't matter whether you build the main or alternate first, you'll get the stickers on (almost - there were a couple leftover that didn't get used in the B-model).

3	Almost Done With the rest of the body done and the wheels on, you really get the scale of this machine.

3	That blue seat is tiny compared to the rest of it!

3	And yes, the uneven steering lock got fixed.

3	After putting the wheels on, you add a couple of "pin with ball" pieces to the underside to restrict the steering.

3	They didn't do that at first so that you could turn the axles sharper while putting the wheels on, which made it easier to do.

3	The Grinder Keeping in mind the scale of the machine, this thing looks terrifying!

3	The tan gear at the back drives the spinning blade up front.

3	The red bushes near the turntable let you adjust the angle.

3	All Done The arm quickly attaches to the body and it's done.

3	Sadly, that tan gear doesn't connect to anything - it's just a knob so you can spin the blade by hand.

3	Raise Your Hand, If You're Sure... (I think I'm dating myself with that title...) This thing has massive reach.

3	I'm imagining this inside a mine, grinding away the rock overhead.

3	Pretty viciously effective machine!

3	The crank on this side of the model is used to raise and lower the arm.

3	Works well, and the grey spacer makes it nice to use since it spins freely.

3	The Leftovers Not much left for a B-model.

3	Nice usage!

3	Starting the Main Model The main model starts similarly to the alternate, with a frame, some axles, and a drive connection from one axle to something later.

3	Getting Complicated Already We're only a few pieces in and we already have three separate gear trains going on.

3	There's the axle driving the tan beveled gears inside the frame at the bottom.

3	There's more tan gears in the middle, and there's also a black gear sticking up as a knob that turns the grey connector in the center.

3	The Body is Done I skipped ahead quite a bit, but it was a bunch of standard Technic building.

3	You've got a fake engine with fan at the back, driven by one of the rear wheels, a knob sticking up for steering, and an axle coming forward to open and close the claw.

3	The Claw!

3	I like that they used a link system to open and close the claw instead of just gearing it.

3	The axle comes forward from the chassis (it's the red axle) with a couple u-joints for flexibility and drives a worm gear.

3	That rotates a gear below with a 2 stud liftarm on each side.

3	Those arms have pin with towball in them and then a link going from that short liftarm to the claw.

3	It's a small rotation of the liftarm, but makes the claw open widely and works very well.

3	Raising the Claw A few black liftarms join the claw to the body of the loader and allow it to move up and down.

3	It's a simple mechanism there - one yellow beam goes back and connects to a lever that lets you raise and lower the claw.

3	When raised (as shown), the lever locks in place by going just slightly past the centerline.

3	And It's Done Add some wheels, a cab, and some wheel arches and we're done.

3	It's a great looking machine, pretty unique, and looks like the real thing.

3	The main difference from reality is these usually have a scoop for moving loose rock.

3	Since we've had so many scooping vehicles in the past (tracked loaders, the Volvo L350F, excavators, etc) the claw here is a fun change and adds to the playability for kids.

3	Like the real thing, the body stays very low so the cab only has to stick up a little bit for the driver to see all around, because mines are cramped and busy areas.

3	From the Rear This angle is great.

3	I love the use of the new mudguard panels to make a nice curve to the back of the loader.

3	The antenna is a little weird, but perhaps they had a big pile of flat silver fencing swords to use up.

3	The black gear just to the left of the antenna is the claw control.

3	Rotating that gear opens and closes it.

3	The back end is a little lighter than a real machine would be, but Lego wanted to leave the engine exposed so you can see the cylinders moving.

3	The Conclusion So, what's my conclusion on this model?

3	I like it a lot.

3	It's simpler than a big set would be, but it's got lots of design and playability crammed in a mid-sized set.

3	It's a unique vehicle.

3	However, it does have a few flaws.

3	The steering on the main model needs some drag added.

3	As is, you basically have to drive by holding the steering knob since it'll bend if you push it from behind.

3	I don't like the use of pin with pin hole as mounting points for the orange and red trans plates for lights, since they can turn slightly and be at weird angles.

3	The antenna is unnecessary and in the way.

3	But none of these flaws are dealbreakers or even big deals.

3	They're minor.

3	The Ratings Value: 10/10 - Less than 10 cents a piece, lots of useful liftarms and such, nothing too weird or single-use.

3	Design: 9/10 - Looks very realistic for the size of the set, good functionality, not too dependent on stickers Minifigs: n/a - n/a Playability: 9/10 - Controls aren't perfect (loose steering, small knob for claw control) but very functional and cleverly done.

3	Parts: 9/10 - Nice selection, although heavy on the standard yellow and black.

3	Almost zero studded parts.

3	Overall: 9.5/10 - It's a great intro to Technic set - a unique vehicle, good functionality, nice part selection, and decently priced.

3	I like it a lot and plan to keep it around as a finished set.

3	Great review with high quality pictures, well done!!

3	I'm glad you took the time to do it properly.

3	Cool that you have built both models.

3	I agree with the mudguards.

3	They sure look good on this model.

1	I was waiting especially for review of this set.

1	Let me add few things about this... thing.

1	It all will be complainging of person who works with these type of machines, so if you just want a unusual machine in your collection, ignore my complaining :) I see underground loaders almost every day, and believe me, this model would now work in the underground mine.

1	First of all, its cab should stick out more from the frame.

1	Each loader has cab placed out of the chassis, to provide better view for the driver.

1	In this class of machine it would help a bit, but in low loader ones it is extremely important: This is the view from the cab of a low profile loader (looking at front - and yes, front of the machine is where engine is placed, because at least at KGHM all machines drive engine forward): Another thing about that cab is that seat and steering wheel/joysticks are placed perpendicularly to the machine chassis, to provide same view for driving forward and backwards.

1	So another weak spot of the set.

1	The model lacks of trans clear lights on the engine part, because all machines that work underground have same lamps on front and back.

1	Another thing that comes to my mind is that warning light and antena would not live too long in the mine, becuase it could be torn apart by ramming into tunnels roofs.

1	It does resemble shape of underground machine, but not a loader.

1	Only machine that comes to my mind is something that are used for moving/placing hydraulic support jacks in tunnels.

1	Sorry for poor quality, I didn't find better picture of it: It does have claw, four wheels and articulated chassis, but have much greater range of movement of the arm.

1	Anyway, I'd give it at least 3/5 for overall look.

1	Model itself, as a set, looks unfinished (or cut down on pieces after visit of an accountant...) For me it looks like engine part was built differently, with knobs for steering/claw operating sticking out from back.

1	Claw needs almost seven full turns of the worm gear to close from opened position, and is rather annoing to use it in way it is built in this model.

1	Bracket that holds bevel gears responsible for steering is rather loose, being hold in place by single 3/4 pin.

1	On the other hand, the steering works very well.

1	It seems that lack of differential will be more common in LEGO sets, becuase it is another model that have fake engine driven by single wheel (like in old russian RC cars...).

1	I am OK with that, but it is a pitty that this model has only R2 engine.

1	Thing that I do not like the most in this model is how the claw arm works.

1	First of all, it barelly lifts the claw of the ground, the movement could be much better.

1	And it has major design flaw - universal joints are not placed in line with articulation points, and this is main reason of 5L axle not being suported on both sides under the turntable.

1	While rainsing the arm, it bends a little!

1	I really would like to see this model built differently, with normal bucket and better range of movement.

1	Edited by M_longer, 05 December 2015 - 11:08 PM.

2	Thanks for the thorough comments!

2	I agree that the set has some limitations, both in construction and realism, but I think they're acceptable given the pricepoint and size.

2	The antenna is definitely ludicrous - I really do suspect they had a surplus of the swords to use up!

2	And yes, the way the steering knob is mounted is loose.

2	I also noticed that the u-joints to the claw are not in the right spot like you mentioned, but didn't include it since it still works fine.

2	That axle coming forward to the claw has a very long unsupported section that does bend a bit when you raise and lower the claw.

2	It works, but is a bit of a cheat that I'm kinda surprised they let through.

2	I just checked and the bucket from 8043 is a couple studs too wide for this set.

2	I'm betting that was seriously considered, but it'd have meant scaling the whole thing up and that would have put it into a higher price point.

2	Or they could have pulled the mold for the 8x14 bucket back out and remade it for this set...

2	I really like the model you built!

2	And that's interesting about the cabs being basically flush with the top but sticking out the side.

2	In image searching as part of my research, I found both that style and ones like this, with the cab sticking up more (like the photo of the Caterpillar one in my review).

2	I wonder if that's a US/European difference, or different types of mining, or what, because both styles definitely exist in the real world.

3	Excellent review!

3	Worth waiting for.

3	The set itself is very interesting.

3	looks like it may have one interesting build techniques.

3	Thanks for the review, Andy Ad

2	Great review, thank you.

2	The set to me is kinda blah, interested more in the new panels than the rest of it.

3	Think this is the only 1H set I'll be getting.

3	Guess I'm waiting for 2H for the rest of the construction stuff!

3	This set looks okay to me; it includes the instructions for both models, which is cool, and includes some great parts.

3	I like that it's not just another bucket loader and that it actually tries something different, too.

1	Great review and great pictures !

1	Many thanks for talking the time to review this set .

1	I am a fan of LEGO Technic construction stuff, but this set is not so appealing to me.

1	But, then again I am sure some people will love it.

1	Indeed very good review!

1	and also good points pointed out by m_longer ;) this set doesnt appealing to me neither, but before i knew what it was i was thinking it was interesting but now... its so simple, a set close to 500 pieces with only 1 real function, and the entire rear section looks unfinished.

1	Great review!

1	One thing reaaaaaally bothers me about this set, both models have the engine connected to one wheel, the other wheel on the "powered" axle is just left to rotate freely, and that really bothers me, as it did in 42022 (on 42022 even more TBH, since its main feature is being a frigging car).

1	Looking at the pics it isnt even a space issue (as it was in the hot rod, where they "needed" to route the steering through), so they just cheaped out and didnt bother fitting a diff in there (or even a live axle link) Im not very interested in this set (not into construction stuff), but i think this is a worrying trend :(

3	Thanks for review, mostlytechnic.

3	Not a must have for me, but this set have nice assortment of parts... new turntable, new panels (i like yellow).

3	And if i'll buy two of this sets - i'll get enough wheels for proper 18-wheeler.

3	And rubber connectors, that i almost don't using at all, but want to have more and more) Edited by Victor Imaginator, 06 December 2015 - 02:19 PM.

2	Definately a quirky set, I think I'd have prefered a bucket on the front with a complex lift and tip mechanism, but a grab is different.

2	As for the B model, I may prefer it's functions to the A model, certainly something different we have not seen before.

2	Great review indeed!

2	looks like its using the z60 turntable that's on the Mercedes and the crawler crane 42042

2	some mods "all wheel drive" V6 instead straight 2 cylinder Bucket instead Gripper Back lights and oldschool worngear mechanics instead of linear actuators Edited by efferman, 26 December 2015 - 05:52 PM.

3	Nice mod there, Effe, might inspire me when I get one and start modding it

1	Cool mod by effe.

1	But the original model out of the box is one of the poorest models TLG ever released.

1	Looks from front to rear as a cheaped out set with really lazy design effort.

1	A shame for the responsible Lego designer Parts assortment seems to be ok but this should Not be the most important Criteria Sry Jim, i really appreciate your always very well done reviews and offen i agree with the Overall judgements/verdicts and of course tastes are different but especially that review sounds like gushing praise in my ears....

3	Lego 42045 Technic Hydroplane Racer Thanks to Lego and EuroBricks for making this review possible!

3	This was supposed to be a preview-review, before the Dec 1 release date for the set, but it got stuck in customs or something and didn't arrive in time.

3	Well, I'd rather do a good, late review than a rushed review, so here it is.

3	Name: Hydroplane Racer Set Number: 42045 Pieces: 180 Price: $19.99 Minifigs: 0 Theme: Technic Year of Release: 2016 Links: Bricklink Brickset The Box Standard Technic box.

3	Action photo, 2-in-1 logo, inset of functions.

3	And the new "try our app" logo in the corner.

3	The Box Back More standard stuff with the B-model and a larger app ad.

3	The Contents 3 bags, two manuals (yes, despite all the ads for their instructions app, they included printed manuals for both the main and B models!

3	), a BIG sticker sheet, and two loose black beams.

3	The Interesting Parts There's a lot of panels in this set.

3	Some are new colors (the blue curved panel) and the L-shaped blue panels are a new mold.

3	I see them being used as mudguards on future sets (or maybe even this year; I haven't looked at the other 2016 Technic sets in detail yet).

3	The hose, soft axle 7 long in black is new as well.

3	The normal 7 axle in yellow is a new color too, and I have no idea why it's in this set.

3	Both models use it in invisible places, so there's no reason other than making it easier to grab the right length axle to have it.

3	I assume other sets this year are using it, but I'm not sure.

3	The Manual And the dumbing-down continues.

3	Now they have to show people to compare axle lengths to the 1:1 prints on the page that have always been there.

3	But how does the 1:1 work on the app?

3	Might have to look into that... (for the record...

3	I pulled out my phone and tried to find the app in the Google store.

3	Couldn't find it.

3	So then I went to the Lego website shown on the page and it had a link to it.

3	Turns out it wasn't showing up because it's tablet only, so Google wasn't showing it to me on my phone.

3	I'll try again later with a tablet...) Starting the Build Two Technic standards.

3	A bunch of pieces linked together to make a specific pattern of holes, and an engine block.

3	Some Weirdness This felt very weird to me - making the crankshaft for the engine, they have you build it right to left.

3	I don't know if it's because I'm a lefty or what, but it felt awkward.

3	I need to look in some old manuals and see if it's always been this way... (nope!

3	I randomly looked at 2013's set 42000 Racer, and it builds it left to right.)

3	Assembling the Core Here's the core of the racer, upside down.

3	The engine block, some gears at each end, and a couple boat studs for smooth gliding.

3	And yes, they cheated and those are only attached on two studs instead of all 4.

3	I'm always amazed at how Lego geometry keeps finding interesting ways that it works.

3	Like here, with those boat studs.

3	They fit perfectly into the bottom of the brick and against the beam.

3	The Front End Up front we get a standard blue seat with a couple "hidden" wheels behind it.

3	A boat doesn't typically have wheels, but these will drive the mechanisms of this model, so we'll let it slide.

3	An odd part choice here though - in the very front there are two tan "axle pin without friction" parts holding that 3 long liftarm on.

3	Why?

3	There's no need in either model for the non-friction pin, and there's lots of the normal blue axle pins in the set.

3	So why include these two different pins?

3	And All Done!

3	It looks like a huge jump here, but it's really not.

3	The front and rear connect to each other, and then a bunch of big panels are added that make the model look WAY bigger.

3	The stickers on this set really make it work.

3	Without them it's pretty bland and boring, so I recommend using them.

3	From the Rear At the back we have a fan to propel the boat.

3	That's not so accurate.

3	All the images I can find of real-life boats use props in the water.

3	But since this is a non-floating model, we have to make some tweaks I guess.

3	There also should be fins going down into the water for stability and hydroplaning, but again, had to drop that.

3	Here's an example of a real boat: You can see they nailed the overall look quite well.

3	The Underside For those that want to see the mechanicals, here's the underside of the model.

3	Minifig Scale Technic?

3	Nope, not quite.

3	A fig will fit the seat, but sticks out of the cockpit and can't fit a helmet at all.

3	So close...

3	Starting the B Model Again with the engine block, but this time an opposing 4 instead of inline.

3	An Odd Part It's rare for Lego to include parts specific to the B-model, so I was curious when I found this 2-axle with pin, a fairly new part.

3	In the main model, it's used in a place that a normal 3 pin would have been fine, and it's the only one of these in the whole set, so it obviously must be needed in the B-model.

3	Sure enough, there's an assembly here that needs it: The Front of the Boat More upside-down building.

3	And that silver piston is basically only there as a spacer.

3	It has no real function.

3	(Yet.... it turns out later an axle goes into it, so it's a support for one end of the axle.)

3	Adding the Wheels We keep building around the engine.

3	This model uses the same wheel setup as the main model.

3	Taking Shape The B-model instructions tell you to put the stickers on in case you haven't - they actually did a good job making the sticker work on either model.

3	But the silver piston used as a cross-brace is a bit weird.

3	It can spin, so that axle hole on the side ends up facing whatever way it wants.

3	The Back End The flex axles are used here under the panels just for appearance and to support the exhausts at the right angle.

3	Same fan propulsion as the main model, and just as wrong here :) Worse, the gearing is switched.

3	In the main model, the pistons and fan spin pretty quickly as you push the boat across the floor.

3	In this one, they turn very slowly.

3	More Instruction Weirdness I'm always curious at how Lego decides to do instructions.

3	Here's how the panels on one side of the boat are assembled.

3	For the mirror image on the other side, they tell you to put all 3 pins into the short panel as step 1 (2 black and a blue), add the white piece as step 2, and then add teh second panel and stickers as step 3.

3	Why two different ways?

3	All Done Here's a similar angle as most of the official images.

3	Looks ok.

3	I noticed though how obvious the wheels are.

3	The back of the box image is a lower angle that hides them more.

3	And I like the mudguard panels as seats.

3	Pretty clever.

3	From the Side I'm not fond of the profile.

3	It doesn't sit level like I think it should.

3	The wheels are a stud too low sticking out of the bottom.

3	The Underside Like most B-models, there are compromises.

3	There's pins and axles sticking out, but that's what you do when faced with a limited piece selection.

3	Minifig Scale Yet?

3	Nope, not quite.

3	A bit too big this time.

3	I think the driver is supposed to sit in the seat with knees over the front of the guard (where the grey pin is).

3	So the minifig is way too small.

3	Spare Pieces Very few leftovers in this B-model.

3	The Conclusion So, what's my conclusion on this model?

3	The B-model is fairly meh, and too similar to the main model.

3	However, I LOVE the hydroplane racer itself.

3	It looks great and is very swooshable.

3	For the price, it's surprisingly large thanks to the big panels on the sides, Yes, this is one set that really needs the stickers to look good, but they look great and are well worth putting on.

3	The Ratings Value: 9/10 - Close to 10 cents a piece, and a fairly large model for the price.

3	Design: 9/10 - Looks great other than the tiny fan on the back.

3	Minifigs: n/a - I was tempted to give a score since a minifig almost fits, but that'd be cheating.

3	Playability: 8/10 - Not much functionality other than the engine and fan spinning, but very swooshable and sturdy enough to be played with.

3	Parts: 9/10 - A bunch of panels (including some new ones), just about every kind of Technic pin, and quite a few thin liftarms .

3	Overall: 9/10 - The set is a solid winner, as long as your satisfied with the main model.

3	Again, great review with superb pictures.

3	The white and blue certainly works very well with your dark backdrop.

3	Thorough review for such a small model.

3	Small in size but great as a set.

3	Tell me, why did I let you review this one?

3	!

2	Quote And the dumbing-down continues.

2	Now they have to show people to compare axle lengths to the 1:1 prints on the page that have always been there.

2	But how does the 1:1 work on the app?

2	Might have to look into that... (for the record...

2	I pulled out my phone and tried to find the app in the Google store.

2	Couldn't find it.

2	So then I went to the Lego website shown on the page and it had a link to it.

2	Turns out it wasn't showing up because it's tablet only, so Google wasn't showing it to me on my phone.

2	I'll try again later with a tablet...) Funny thing is that they changed colour of 7L axle to yellow, and on that picture it still is in LBG.

1	Thanks for a great review!

1	Too bad there is only one blue curved panel in this set.

1	My opinion on the frictionless axlepins is that the flex axle might be easier to stick in them than in regular/blue axlepins...

1	Didn't actually try it though :-) Edited by MajklSpajkl, 05 December 2015 - 11:46 PM.

3	Excellent review!

3	I am glad that you did not rush this or the Mine Loader review.

3	Could it be that the fan in the back is like a turbo prop propulsion.... Just reaching here.

3	Andy D

1	Thank you for the review.

1	I have this one in my pile to build.

1	I wish there was more of the curved blue panels though.

3	here is a video review via JANG to add to the review: i like both A and B so will buy both.

2	MajklSpajkl, on 05 December 2015 - 11:45 PM, said: My opinion on the frictionless axlepins is that the flex axle might be easier to stick in them than in regular/blue axlepins...

2	Didn't actually try it though :-) Frictionless pins have accurate round hole, while blue friction pins have something squarish.

2	Flex axle will fit in both, but using tan pins doesn't require strength.

2	Conncetion with tan pins is weaker too.

2	Great review!

2	Im a bit undecided on the set though, it has some nice parts (4 cil engine in such a small set!)

2	and it looks good, but also a bit small and simple, not sure if it stands up to the standards of the small tracked loader or similar for sets of this size, and as a parts pack (for panels/flaxles) the display team jet is infinitely better.

2	Ill probably pick one up, but right now i really want another tracked loader... (last one was sacrificed to the MOD gods)

3	Nice review, thanks Nice little set, I might buy me one

3	REVIEW - 42038 - ARCTIC TRUCK INTRODUCTION Arctic vehicles aren't new to LEGO.

3	Back in 2000 the Town theme already had several small orange arctic vehicles.

3	In 2014 TLG again released a number of Arctic sets in the City theme (formerly known as Town).

3	Some of these sets are actually pretty big, containing over 700 parts.

3	Looking back in history it seems that Arctic sets may have found their origin in the Technic theme.

3	Although these sets were white instead of orange, they are unmistakenly Arctic.

3	The 1986 Technic Arctic Sets contained the infamous Technic Figures.

3	Unfortunately the 2015 Arctic Truck doesn't contain any Technic Figures, but nonetheless it's great to see a new Arctic vehicle in the Technic line, not counting several snow scooters.

3	Let's see if the new Arctic Truck lives up to the expectations.

3	Note: All images can be clicked for hi-res versions.

3	SET INFORMATION Number: 42038 Title: Arctic Truck Theme: Technic Released: 2015 Part Count: 1219 Box Weight: 2110 gr Box Dimensions: 47,8 cm x 28,0 cm x 7,2 cm Set Price (MSRP): € 79,99 / US$ 84.99 / £ 59.99 Price per Part: € 0,088 / US$ 0.093 / £ 0.066 Links: Brickset, Bricklink THE BOX The box measures 47,8 cm x 28,0 cm x 7,2 cm and weighs around 1385 grams.

3	The box actually feels pretty heavy which means it's filled properly.

3	This seems to be a trend in the Technic theme.

3	Slightly smaller boxes can save shelf space for retailers.

3	THE FRONT The front of the box shows the main model and in the lower right corner there's a image with the dimension of the model.

3	It's 40cm long and 18cm wide.

3	THE BACK The upper part of the back of the box shows the functions of the main model.

3	The lower left section shows the B-model, which looks very promising (more on that later).

3	The lower right section shows the motorization options for the main model.

3	The crane (partially) and the bed can be motorized.

3	Besides motorization some LEDs can be added as headlights.

3	THE SIDE On of the sides shows one of the newer smaller style panels.

3	This is the first time it appears in orange.

3	When you take a look at the sticker you can see that it's not symmetrical.

3	Not sure why TLG "cut of" one of the sides of the stickers, since the position of the panel is very suitable for a continuous sticker.

3	CONTENT OF THE BOX The box is pretty densely packed, which is better than semi-filled boxes.

3	It feels like you actually bought something which matches the box size.

3	The box contains: 2 Booklets 1 Sticker Sheet 8 Bags BOOKLETS & STICKER SHEET Unfortunately the instructions and sticker sheet haven't been packed with cardboard protection, which results in a curved sticker sheet and slightly bent instructions.

3	In my case this wasn't so bad.

3	At least no real damage.

3	HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This set proves to be a great parts pack, especially when you might have missed some of the 2014 sets.

3	BLACK LINK TREADS Usually the Link Treads come in Dark Blue Grey, but this sets includes 96 Black treads, which is great if you'd like to replace the DBG ones in your MOCs, or other official sets.

3	UNDERCARRIAGE AND SUSPENSION Several parts are included to build the undercarriage driving the treads.

3	Four Large Tread Sprockets and eight Small Tread Sprockets, which are used as return sprockets.

3	Also included are four Steering Portal Hubs and four Steering Portal Axles for driving and steering the vehicle.

3	Several frames, including two C-shaped Pivot Frames and two Steering Ball Joints to create an undercarriage much like the 4x4 Crawler.

3	The set even includes two H-shaped Frames (a.k.a.

3	Dog Bone Frames).

3	NEW CHANGEOVER CATCH PARTS This year (2015) three new parts have been introduced to improve the changeover catch.

3	More on these parts later.

3	NEW PIN CONNECTOR Another new part for this year (2015) is the "1L Round Pin Connector", which looks like a pin connector, but acts more like a bush.

3	NEW PINS Furthermore this sets includes quite a large number of three (relatively) new parts.

3	17 x Pin with Pin Hole, 14 x 3L Pin with 1L Axle and 11 x 3L Pin with 2L Axle, which have been introduced this year (2015).

3	When the new 3L Pin with 1L Axle was introduced in 2014 it was only a matter of time before the new 3L Pin with 2L Axle would appear.

3	Both new Pins are a great addition to the parts portfolio.

3	PANELS Last but not least this sets contains a fair number of orange panels, including the 3x11 Panel in Orange, which is the first time we've seen this part.

3	PART LIST Below is the entire part list for the 913 parts.

3	As usual this part list can be found at the end of the second booklet.

3	THE BUILD The build immediately starts with some of the new parts, used to build the compact gearbox in the center of the model.

3	Notice the two 20 Tooth Bevel Gears.

3	One would have been enough to drive the 12 Tooth Bevel Gear, so the second seems to be useless.

3	TLG probably used it in the A-model, because they needed it in the B-model, which you can see later.

3	The front and rear suspension are almost identical.

3	The front side also has the 13L Gear Rack, used for steering.

3	The picture below shows the steering rack on the front suspension in more detail.

3	At this point you have more or less finished the chassis.

3	The gearbox is in place and the majority of the functions has internally been connected to the right gears.

3	The small turntable shows where the crane will be attached later on.

3	At the end of the first booklet, some of the bodywork has been attached to the chassis.

3	The orange-black color scheme never fails to please me.

3	Throw in some cool stickers for the extra effect and we have a winner.

3	If you decide to motorize the model, using PF, the top of the cabin can be lifted to accomodate the battery box.

3	The chassis uses lots of orange (and some black) panels to give the model it's distinctive look.

3	The protective black bumber/railing is a nice addition which adds something to the exterior.

3	The dumping bed at the rear can tilt to empty it's load.

3	It's operated by a Mini LA.

3	The Treads, which look very cool in Black, are driven by a Large Tread Sprocket and returned by two Small Tread Sprockets.

3	The front and rear sections are identical.

3	Building the undercarriages feels a bit repetitive, which is a problem for most tracked vehicles.

3	FINISHED MODEL Adding the crane to the model finishes the build.

3	Your model should look something like this.

3	When you take a close look at the finished model, you realize this is something else.

3	It's trully a unique vehicle.

3	The color scheme is brilliant and the fact that it's an Arctic Truck is really neat.

3	It's a welcome change for the Technic line to see a vehicle like this.

3	This picture emphasizes that's it's a very cool vehicle.

3	Imagine this beast plowing through the snow!

3	As far as I know it's not based on a real life vehicle.

3	If's probably a combination of several vehicles and some imagination.

3	I can be totally wrong though.

3	The rear of the vehicle shows the crane and drum, placed on the tipper bed.

3	From this angle you can see some of the internals of the model, the gearbox behind the cabin for example.

3	The crane can be partially motorized (rotation and base), while the boom is operated manually.

3	What I like a lot is the protective railing around the vehicle.

3	LEFT OVER PARTS Some leftover parts, nothing noteworthy.

3	FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS This set has several functions/features: Steering Driving Suspension Crane Tipping bed STEERING As you can see in the image below the steering mechanism has quite a bit of negative caster (please correct me if I'm wrong), which causes the treads to rotate a bit upward/downward instead of only to the left and right.

3	DRIVING You mention driving as a feature?!

3	Yes I do and let me explain why.

3	Normally I would ommit this as a feature and take driving for granted.

3	However, driving this vehicle (on a flat surface) causes it to simply slide over the surface.

3	For other arctic vehicles this would be a plus, but with a tracked vehicle it limits playability.

3	This is one of the main drawbacks of these tread, they simple don't work properly on smooth surfaces.

3	SUSPENSION The suspension is working properly.

3	You do need to apply some pressure, but all things considered it's not too bad.

3	CRANE The crane has four degrees of freedom: Base rotation Lower boom Upper boom Hook It does what it's supposed to do.

3	Base rotation and lower boom can be motorized and switched using the gearbox, while the upper boom and hook are operated manually.

3	TIPPING BED The tipping is operated via a Mini LA.

3	CONCLUSION While the set does offer various functions and features, driving and steering is a serious issue.

3	Therefor this set is more likely to be showcased than to be played with.

3	B-MODEL Instructions for the B-model are of high quality.

3	Looking at the image below, you will see what I mean.

3	Here's the finished B-model, a tracked Jeep with a communcations device.

3	This alternate model looks so good, it could easily have made it as a main model.

3	One thing that does pop in mind; how would this look with tires?!

3	More on that later.

3	When you are in the artcic region it's imperative to have proper communication channels.

3	Since there's no internet backbone, you will need a big antenna of some sort.

3	This B-model actually features a small trailer wagon with a transmitter/receiver.

3	Here's more detailed image of the B-model, without trailer wagon.

3	I would buy this model in a heartbeat if it were a main model.

3	Simply gorgeous.

3	The side view doesn't give away that this in alternate model.

3	The stickers also work really well in this model.

3	And again, nothing to complain here.

3	The model even has a small crane at the rear, operated by the Mini LA.

3	Here you can see the arctic fleet, comprised of both the A-model and B-model.

3	I bet these two can get some work done!!

3	A bit of a messy picture, but this should give you an impression of the size of both models.

3	LEFTOVER PARTS Not too many parts left, which is obviously a good thing.

3	ALTERNATE MODEL WITH TUMBLER TIRES Just like me, you probably have been wondering how this model would look like with (Tumbler) tires.

3	Well, here it is.

3	As I imagined it does look great.

3	Admittedly, these are not the type of tires we ought to use, but to be honest; I don't really care.

3	Again, the negative caster results in quirky steering.

3	The tires are a bit too big, so they hit the chassis when you compress the suspension.

3	While this has absolutely nothing to do with an arctic vehicle, I really love this picture.

3	SUMMARY We're almost at the end of my review, so what do I think of this set.

3	Let's start with getting the Elephant out of the room; this set lacks proper driving and steering.

3	Does that make it a bad set?!

3	Definitely not!

3	It's a great set, but it lacks some playability when it comes to moving the vehicle.

3	The crane and tipper bed do work properly, so there's still some playability left.

3	Does this set look cool?

3	Definitely!

3	I think it's one of the coolest (no pun intended) and most original models of recent years.

3	The orange and black color scheme works great and the stickers are well designed.

3	The B-model is of very high quality and some might even prefer it over the A-model.

3	And if you are not interested in either of these models, this set provides you with a variety of great parts!

3	All in all I think this is a great set!

3	Maybe not to play with, but it scores high on all other criteria.

3	PROS Original model Great color scheme Lots of interesting parts Great B-model CONS Steering and driving don't work too well Repetitive build of undercarriages (minor con) SCORE Below are my scores based on different categories.

3	8 DESIGN Original and good looking model.

3	7 BUILDING EXPERIENCE Fun to build, albeit a bit repetitive.

3	8 FEATURES Packs quite a few features.

3	7 PLAYABILITY Some features work, some don't.

3	9 PARTS Comes with interesting parts.

3	9 VALUE FOR MONEY Two great model in a single set.

3	8 COOL!

3	As a bonus, here's picture of the main model with Tumbler Tires.

3	Why?

3	Because we can!

3	Very timely review Jim.

3	My wife has just surprised me by giving me this set a few days ago and I have just built the A model two days ago and B model yesterday.

3	I agree with all that you wrote above.

3	I don't have Tumbler tires but I have 9398 tires.

3	Driving is smooth but steering + suspension will be bad as you said due to negative caster and tires hitting the chassis.

3	Anyway, tonight I will destroy the B model and rebuilt this http://www.busterhau...8-c-model.html.

3	I was supposed to publish it together with the 42039 - 24 Hours Racer, but it somehow got backlogged.

3	After completing the reviews for the 2016 sets, I felt I needed to finish it (was already 90% done).

3	That C-model looks cool!

1	The set is a looker, you've got to admit it, but what it gives in looks does not make up for what it lacks in functions.

1	I really wanted this set, badly even, when I restarted my adventure with Technic about a month ago.

1	Than I learned more and more about what a good model can do, mostly thanks to this forum and YT.

1	Right now I'm a bit disappointed with the Arctic Truck - smaller sets offer more functions and teach you much more.

1	Jim it was a great review nevertheless Edited by pgplay, 14 December 2015 - 11:22 AM.

3	Great review.

3	I bought this model several weeks ago and the box has sat on my shelf, so I think after this I will be digging it out for Christmas and I expect my son will have a lot of fun with it when it's built.

3	PS.

3	these Tumbler tyres look amazing on this model, and indeed amazing in their own right!

2	I think this model is more or less supposed to be a version of this thing.

2	A pretty obscure topic, but also very interesting.

2	How about this one: PS I somehow didn't find this picture when I wrote my review.

2	I could be wrong but I am 100% sure that I've seen this review before.

2	You switched the sides for the panel with the unsymmetrical sticker.

2	Otherwise you would see that the cut off part is where there's a beam in front of the panel.

2	That's probably done because the beam could possibly damage the sticker, either while building or while placed against it for a long time.

2	Or it's simply omitted because it wouldn't be (completely) visible

3	Great review and pictures as always.

3	Its an odd combo, but I agree that the B model looks good with tumbler tires THERIZE, on 14 December 2015 - 09:32 PM, said: I could be wrong but I am 100% sure that I've seen this review before.

3	I believe Jim posted the same one in the reviewers academy

3	Another great review I like this set very much, both models look good to me and it's a great part pack for me, the long list in the "high light parts" session tells everything.

3	As for the real world counter part of the A model, how about this: Try googling Sno-Cat and there a lots of such things.

3	Until I saw photos of this set I wasn't convinced I wanted it.

3	Now after seeing all the combinations (A+B and tumbler tires!)

3	I am definitely buying two copies.

3	I need orange parts and black treads anyway.

3	The only problem I have with this is that it's going to encourage me to buy many copies of the drag racer just to get enough wheels to play with.

2	You are 100% wrong Rishab N, on 14 December 2015 - 10:40 PM, said: I believe Jim posted the same one in the reviewers academy Unless you are indeed member of the RA.

2	The review was posted there, but only for a week or so.

2	And I have posted links on Facebook, but that was after I posted it here.

2	We didn't

2	why are all these vehicles orange?

3	Richard Dower, on 15 December 2015 - 02:03 PM, said: why are all these vehicles orange?

3	They prove hard to lose in the snow

1	erelender, on 15 December 2015 - 02:04 PM, said: They prove hard to lose in the snow so....paint them pink..........?

2	Richard Dower, on 15 December 2015 - 02:07 PM, said: so....paint them pink..........?

2	Some ski goggles also have yellow/orange-ish glasses, so I reckon orange and white form a contrasting combination.

3	Jim, on 14 December 2015 - 09:15 AM, said: While this has absolutely nothing to do with an arctic vehicle, I really love this picture.

3	This really puts me in mind of one of those Arctic 4x4s from the Top Gear Arctic Special:

2	Nequmodiva, on 14 December 2015 - 09:48 PM, said: You switched the sides for the panel with the unsymmetrical sticker.

2	Otherwise you would see that the cut off part is where there's a beam in front of the panel.

2	That's probably done because the beam could possibly damage the sticker, either while building or while placed against it for a long time.

2	Or it's simply omitted because it wouldn't be (completely) visible This is probably the only reason (for TLG choosing to provide an asymmetrical sticker), but looking at the sticker sheet, I also believe they simply didn't have the space on the sheet for a symmetrical solution.

2	A symmetrically stickered panel could have more (re)uses for the MOC'ers.

2	On Lego's own B-model, they handily camouflage it with the exhausts

1	Jim/anyone....i built this set a few days ago, i dont like the way the crane arm section has no knob to turn the mini turntable.

1	you see the 20 tooth gear?....there is a pinhole located next to this....i would like to add something here to make it easier to turn the winch section.

1	I have the 42038, nice set but I found the tipping of the bed clumsy.

1	It was a pleasure to build and I do like the build with the tumble wheels

3	Thank you Jim, nice Review It´s a great set: A lot unique parts and not just pins, axles and beams.

3	I bough it to bring me back to Lego from my DA (10 years)... PS.

3	Soon I will post an alternative model

3	You wrote a very accurate review of this set, Jim.

3	It's a pretty good model (with some obvious problems) but it's an even better parts pack.

3	Your pictures with the Tumbler tires are great.

3	What is the material of the gray background?

3	Thank you for the mention.

3	REVIEW - 42001 - MINI OFF-ROADER INTRODUCTION Technic Mini models are sometimes regarded as models not worth buying.

3	I don't agree with this opinion.

3	Whether it's a special part or innovative building technique, almost every Mini model has something that makes the set worthwhile.

3	This time I will be reviewing the 42001 Mini Off-Roader.

3	This model is not a smaller version of an existing model, so there's no real comparison with a bigger brother, or sister if you will.

3	Nor does the model resemble a real life brand or vehicle, so it is what it is, a Mini Off-Roader.

3	Note: All images can be clicked for hi-res versions.

3	SET INFORMATION Number: 42001 Title: Mini Off-Roader Theme: Technic Released: 2013 Part Count: 100 Box Weight: 165 gr Box Dimensions: 15,5 x 14,0 x 4,2 cm Set Price (MSRP): 9.99 EUR DE / 7.99 GBP / 12.99 USD Price per Part: DE 0.100 EUR / UK 0.080 GBP / USA 0.130 USD Links: Brickset, Bricklink THE BOX The box measures 15,5 x 14,0 x 4,2 cm which is obviously not very big.

3	The weight of the box is approximately 165 grams.

3	FRONTSIDE The front of the box shows a though four wheel drive off-roader challenging a fierce rocky mountain trail...now does it?!

3	What the box actually shows is Mini Off-Roader challenging a small foam rock formation, much like rocks used in Star Trek The Original Series, yet smaller The box also states that this model is for the age of 7 till 14.

3	More importantly, the 2-models in-1 logo is clearly visible, which means this set can be used to build two different models.

3	BACKSIDE The backside shows a picture of the alternate model and a smaller version of the original model.

3	The conversion arrow and the 2-in-1 are printed to clarify that the main model can be converted into a secondary model.

3	SIDES One of the sides shows the 2-in-1 logo and a picture of the main model.

3	Another side shows a picture of one of the wheels in actual size and again, a picture of the main model.

3	CONTENTS OF THE BOX The box contains: 2 Booklets 2 Bags 4 Tires BOOKLETS This set contains two booklets which is not very common for a set this size.

3	Both models share the same chassis, which is why the build has been divided over two booklets, one for the chassis (8 pages with 10 steps) and one for the bodywork (34 pages with 23 steps for the main model and 20 steps for the alternate model).

3	BAGS The box contains only 2 bags which is to be expected from a set consisting of 100 parts.

3	One of the bags is filled with liftarms, panels, rims and two elastic bands.

3	The other bags contains all the other parts, like pins, axles, connectors, etc.

3	Opening the bags results in the following collection of parts, with the exception of the tires.

3	No abundant number parts that will add real value to your collection.

3	Nevertheless, there are some interesting orange parts and elastic bands.

3	TIRES The tires are provided seperately (i.e.

3	not contained in the bags).

3	From the picture you can see that these tires have a front and a back side, so you should pay attention when fitting them to the rims, which have two different sides as well.

3	HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This section describes the unique and/or highlighted parts.

3	VERY SMALL SMOOTH TECHNIC PANEL (#21 AND #22) These two small Technic were new at the time of release and this set was only one of two sets containing them in orange.

3	The other set is the 42007 - Moto Cross Bike.

3	At the moment of writing there's a third set containing these parts, the Black Champion Racer.

3	Side A Side B SMALL RUBBER BAND I was under the impression that these White Rubber Bands weren't that common, but it seems that these bands are as common as dirt.

3	But hey, you can't have enough rubber bands!

3	THIN LIFTARM 1x5 WITH AXLE HOLES Like the panels, these Liftarms were also new at the time of release.

3	Looking at the the frequent usage in other sets, this part has proven to be a most useful mammal.

3	THIN LIFTARM 1x3 Not a very rare piece per se, but if you are not into Bionicle, this liftarm part can be hard to find.

3	Your other option would be to buy the 9390 - Mini Tow Truck, or the 8305 - Dual Bikes from a while ago (2000).

3	LONG PIN WITH CENTER PIN HOLE This relatively new kid on the block is currently used in many Technic and non-Technic sets and has well proven it's worth.

3	AXLE PIN CONNECTOR HUB WITH 2 AXLES Like the previous part this newish part is also quite helpful in certain situations.

3	PART LIST Here's the complete list for all 100 parts.

3	BUILDING EXPERIENCE The build starts with the chassis of the Off-Roader.

3	After connecting some liftarms two elastic bands, one on each side, are attached to the towball pins.

3	This is all there is to the suspension, plain and simple.

3	The two elastic bands contract the L-shaped liftarms, which results in the long ends swiveling downwards.

3	The video below demonstrates the suspension.

3	The simplicity doesn't do it justice, because it works like a charm.

3	The suspension is very smooth with the right amount of stretch and resistance.

3	This great working suspension adds a lot of value to this set.

3	To quote John Hurt in the movie Contact: "Why build one when you can have two at twice the price?".

3	I have purchased two sets so we can simultaneously see both models and make a proper comparison.

3	Below you can see two identical chassis which will be used for both versions of the build.

3	At this stage we have arrived at the end of the first booklet, which only took about ten minutes.

3	Not surprising, since the first booklet only has 10 building steps.

3	Progressing to the second booklet, you need to choose between building the main and alternative model.

3	That's a choice I don't need to make for this review, so let's start with the main model.

3	MAIN MODEL When building the bodywork there's a rather peculiar building technique, which you wouldn't expect in an official LEGO set.

3	The Axle and Pin Connector Hub with 2 Axles only protrudes halfway into the Double Bent Liftarm.

3	The Thin 1x4 Liftarm which is added in one of the following steps makes sure the hubs stay perfectly in place, but I was still surprised to see this technique.

3	The finished bodywork for the main model looks like....uhh...well.....I don't know exactly.

3	It doesn't bear any resemblance to a real life model, which makes it hard to judge.

3	One thing's for sure; it's not the best looking Technic Mini Model.

3	The bodywork can be attached to the chassis by using a 7L axle and two bushes, one on each side of the chassis.

3	ALTERNATE MODEL Unfortunately the alternate model doesn't look much better than the main model.

3	It's even a stud less wide, while you would like to see slightly more body, matching the size of the tires and chassis.

3	Attached to the chassis the body is even more out of proportion.

3	It's not really ugly and the color scheme is great (obviously this goes for the main model as well), but the body simply doesn't match the chassis.

3	I can only imagine that this model is supposed to have a chibi look, much like the Microfighter Star Wars models.

3	COMPARISON The following section shows a selection of images from different angles to compare the main and secondary model.

3	The main model has a bit more volume, while the alternate model has a more sporty look.

3	FRONT VIEW The main model has headlights which are attached at a higher point, while the alternate model has headlights which are placed more closely next to each other.

3	REAR VIEW A slightly different setup in both models, where the main model again has higher placed rear lights.

3	SIDE VIEW The side view shows that the panels are used differently in both models.

3	The main models uses them as doors, while the alternate model uses them as engine cover (bonnet).

3	TOP VIEW The top view reveals that the main model might have room for a minifig PARTS LEFT The left image shows the parts which are left after building the main model, while the second image shows the parts left after building the alternate model.

3	As you can see, the main model uses slightly more parts than the alternate model.

3	FEATURES Besides the awesome suspension, which we already have discussed, there aren't a lot of features in this set.

3	There's actually a single feature, which is only present in the main model....opening doors!

3	Wow, impressive!

3	Well, maybe we can't expect too much functionality in such a small model.

3	SUMMARY The Off-Roader is a fun model which is fairly easy to build.

3	The suspension is simple, yet very effective.

3	The model could do better in the design department, but the suspension offers great playability and that is what this set is all about.

3	The orange parts are not very common so they are an added bonus.

3	All things considered this set is definitely worth the few bucks you need to spend on it.

3	PROS Great suspension Fun to play with Some (semi) rare orange parts Great color scheme CONS No resemblence to an actual off-roader Not the best looking model SCORE Below are my scores based on different categories.

3	6 DESIGN Not the best looking Technic model.

3	7 BUILDING EXPERIENCE The suspension makes it fun to build.

3	7 FEATURES The suspension makes up for the lack of functionality.

3	8 PLAYABILITY The model has Car-Swooshability.

3	7 PARTS Some interesting orange parts.

3	8 VALUE FOR MONEY Great present for the younger builders.

3	7,1 ELASTIC Hope you enjoyed it!

3	Thanks for reading and please rate this set at the top of this topic!

3	Once again, excellent review Jim!

3	Than you for not skipping this small but pretty great set.

3	I also got two of this and I have to say, I really admire the nifty suspension.

3	Building a third bodywork for the same suspension system is still on my backlog.

3	The suspension is indeed awesome.

3	For it's size, this is a great set!

3	Looking at the grades, I seem to have lowballed the score.

2	Sad, i miss this set.

3	Looks like you are late 2 years) Nice set that you can play on your working place while small pauses This set is very cool, especially when you can: 42001 chassis + imagination = http://www.bricksafe...es/rm8/TLC_FJ40 Edited by rm8, 14 December 2015 - 11:17 AM.

1	I don't like appearance of this off-roader at all but I've got it as gift so it's in my Technic collection now.

1	When I built it I was very surprised how cool suspension it has and how much playability it features.

1	I've also tried to build some alternative model out of it but without success.

1	Anyway thank you Jim for great review!

3	Here is the review...for Broadside's Brig 6259!

3	A set from 1991, with a handsome count of 64 pieces, 3 figures, and a sale price of $8.75!

3	The building(and parrot): We'll start off with the front.

3	It looks like a good solid building to hold those scurvy dogs!

3	We yonder over to the left side: And see a nice open back: And yonder to the plain right side: Back to the left, we find the corner, with a nice area to rest your tired soldiers!

3	We see the platform in the corner, a lovely place for soldiers to stand on!

3	It's a bit...skimpy, so watch your step!

3	The middle is blocked by some stones, assuring security!

3	But still open enough to stand in!

3	The jail is cramped, and fits only TWO people, but we only need one prisoner in this set :-) !

3	Moving up is the watch tower, a place for your soldier stand and stand watch or for silly parots to sit on!

3	Here's the front middle part, again those stones blocking the way!

3	Figures and Accesories: We have a delightful number of a soldier, a sailor, and a scurvy pirate!

3	A lovely parot!

3	And a generous assortment of weapons!

3	That concludes our review.

3	Overall: It's a fantastic little set, and great for army and supplies and bricks gathering!

3	I can't find any faults with this set, it's just the neatest little thing you've seen in a port *wub* Highly recomended *y* .

3	And to end our review: A comic!

2	You've done a good job of this review Mr ImperialScouts!

2	But two things.

2	1) Background far too bright and the set is far too dark, easily rectified with Brightness & Contrast adjustment.

2	2) No poll to rate the set out of 5.

2	Nonetheless this should be frontpaged on Classic-Pirates.com!

3	A fine little set with 64 pieces and 3 figures for under $10.

3	May have seemed a bit steep in 1991, but I wouldn't know, I'd passed into my dark ages already, so alas, I haven't a copy of this set.

3	Looking at the parts list, I could build one out of my current inventory though.

3	Issued today for $10, I'd buy no less than 14 of them, even though it does lack the obligatory rowboat for the pirate to make his escape in.

3	Very nice review and comic, thanks for doing them!

3	*y* Edited by imperialshadows, 20 October 2007 - 06:10 AM.

2	Nonetheless, the picture was fixed, and appears to be alright.

2	But I'm glad that the review is enjoyed!

2	I'm not generous but I'll do it anyway X-D Now I need to write an artistic statement and then I can write my own review for Broadside's Brig!

2	Huzzah!

2	...and title change as well...the best Conquistador out there!

2	:-$

2	The Poll doesn't allow you to select 2 from 1-5.

2	It instead says 1, 3, 3, 4, 5.

2	But besides that, your review I give it a 5 because 1) shows the set in all angles 2) shows the characters 3) comment on the little creature comforts of the set 4) added a comic (playability) 5) showed true enthusiasm *y* *wub*

2	The poll is for the set, not the review :-D .

2	But thank you anyway!

2	And it appears Mister Phes made the mistake :-P !

1	i'd give a 2, but you put 3 two times.

1	Is a nice set but is not really cool.

1	Is a worse version of Lagoon lock up

3	It's not too expansive and you get some nice pieces like that jail, the damaged yellow corner and a shako of course *wub* For this i''l give it a 4!

3	Very nive review imperial scouts, keep it up!

3	*y* Edited by Captain green hair, 20 October 2007 - 12:39 PM.

3	A nice little set.

3	Silly parrots ON!

3	For the price it really looks like a nice set.

3	Because of the lack of a cannon, I give it a 4.

3	Cool comic IS!

3	Nice review, funny little story, and a 4 from me.

3	A useful little set indeed.

3	*sweet*

3	Great review, cool comic.

3	*wub* I give the set a four, and I will go and buy it now as I am missing many of those parts.... oh it's not for sale?

3	Off to Bricklink then!

3	:-D

3	How much was it again?

3	for the price it looks really solid.

3	if u add the prison to the back it looks REAL good.

1	Well i only know the European Price: 89.99 Euros I think that's quiet expensive against the 2005 Police Station (7237): 74.99 Euros - RupeeClock

3	Hello, Well as this is my first review I hope you like it.

3	The 7744 police station is simply fanstastic.

3	The many minifigs and the vehicles makes it really nice.

3	The great playabillaty and and great space makes it great for children I think.

3	But latest but not least the pics!

3	: Well and as last: The interrogation room: Well this was the review.

3	I hope you liked it!

3	Bye

3	Thank you very much for the review, THE-FORCE!

3	The new police station looks great!

3	I really like its lovely interior - amazing!

3	By the way: I have a question: Are there any beds, tables or/and seats for the prisoners in their cells?

3	There are graffiti on the walls inside the cell too.. haha.. cute.

3	Hooray assuming from the picture on the box we will also be getting the old police car and bike in blue aswell!

3	I really like this set it seems the best police station we've had in a long time and what a great amount of figures!

3	Thanks for this great insight the-force!

3	;-)

3	It's mine *wub*!

3	Just got my Luke today from TRU in in Merrilville, IN... ;-)!

3	So here's some pictures and thoughts: Still in the packing with the box Pieces out in the fresh air Put together, ready for some serious Vader vacking >:-)!

3	If you this close you're so dead!!

3	It's yet another lovely maquette *wub*!

3	The only downside is that the LEGO SW sign doesn't even resemble (ok, I've exagurating a bit :'-)) the ones from the other maquettes!

3	Check out this one from the Blackhole Trooper compared with the Luke one: The Luke one is has a massproduced look over it with just a printing |-/ , the other has depth & a painting on it.

3	Now I'm waiting for the long overdue Boba one!

3	Here's the other maquettes reviewed: Darth Vader & Stormie Blackhole Stormie Maquettes On copmike

2	Excellent review copmike!

2	I feel as if I've actually seen the maquette up close in real life.

2	X-D I swear I've even touched it.

2	Tack for sharing min kompis!

2	*sweet*

3	Awesome!

3	These maquettes are really cool, thanks for the review!

3	*y* ~Peace

3	Very nice, thanks for these cool pictures!

3	*y*

3	Beautiful...I'm really trying to resist these.

3	Any word on who's next after Boba Fett?

3	A C-3PO/R2-D2 pair would probably push me over the edge.

3	Verry cool, love it, what was the price?

3	Finally, the highly anticipated Luke Skywalker Maquette!

3	I'm still looking forward to that Boba!

3	Thanks to this information.

3	It's interesting for me.

3	:-)

2	thanks for the cool picture!

2	How big are those Maquettes?

2	Could you make a picture with a minifig next to the maquette please?

1	Ah yes, I saw a whole shelf of them in my TRU(touched it too!)

1	Too small, and WAY overpriced.

1	Waste of miney.

1	The luke is 6" high!

1	What is that?!?!

1	Great review!

1	Wow i went to my local toysrus and apparently they had some there dont really like them but there neat:)

1	Not my thing, but a very nice review, thanks for sharing it!

1	I was seriously considering this one when it was originally announced as a 6212 copack item at a particularly good price and then everything changed.

1	I do, however, seriously ache to get my hands on one of the more traditionally LEGO looking 2ft+ Vaders they use in the official stores (at least they had one here in Orlando).

1	*wub*

2	Nice review.

2	How's the head made attached to the body?

2	Is there also a boba Fett maquette??

2	If y please a pic??!!?

2	Thanks!

2	While it isn't my style, it looks pretty cool.

2	Thanks for sharing!

2	*sweet*

2	Can you swap head?

2	and coler on the saber?

2	if you have other heads and other lightsaber blades, yes :)

3	During the annual Thanksgiving Road Trip to the relatives, I stopped by the TRU in Portland, OR.

3	Lo and behold, the new Mars Mission sets!

3	Obviously, I bought them.

3	;-) The box: Not much to say.

3	Standard box art for MM sets, nothing new.

3	The parts: Some good parts here.

3	Even if you don't like the set (Which I highly doubt after I've had my say :-P ), it's a decent parts pack.

3	I noticed that some old parts have been renewed.

3	I know the wheel has been used in the '07 sets, but the cockpit and hitch I haven't seen in a while.

3	The VLDSS (Very large DSS).

3	Grr.

3	New part.

3	At least, I think it is.

3	Someone slap me if it isn't.

3	*wacko* The figs.

3	I know I've seen that head before, but I have no idea where.

3	Does anyone know?

3	I was hoping that the aliens would have new arms, at least.

3	I was sadly mistaken... On the upside, I finally discovered that they glow in the dark.

3	:-$ The alien has a jetpack.

3	If that's not the silliest thing I've ever seen, I don't know what is.

3	The build.

3	Simple build.

3	A block.

3	So easy a caveman cou- oh, never mind.

3	Geico's used that one enough.

3	Then, we have this jobber right here.

3	Not sure what it is, but it looks like some crystal scanning device.

3	It's starting to look pretty nice.

3	It almost looks practical.

3	The cockpit is suffering from a bad dose of over-stickering.

3	On the upside, we have a new piece there to hold the cockpit on.

3	Part 1 complete.

3	It has a nice little radio antenna, which is ruined by the use of a random missile that looks like it's going to shoot the antenna before it shoots the alien.

3	Still, I never say no to a good missile I can use for something else.

3	The trailer: Fairly simple, but it works.

3	It features stabilizing arms, a handheld saw, and an extremely random mini-bot who's purpose escapes me.

3	The Whole Meal Deal- Erm, general pics.

3	Overall, I thought this was a good set.

3	In fact, it reminds me of this:

3	Finally we have seen the light!!!

3	I've been waiting for a while deciding if I was gonna get this....well I've decided after that wonderful review I am!

3	Good job reviewin!!

3	*wub*

3	Cool review, thanks!!

3	:-D I personally think the minirobot is awesome, and (dare I say) cute!

3	This was described on Amazon to be a mobile lab, I'm not seeing that.

3	I do however see a crystal hauling vehicle.

3	*sweet* Pretty cool, not as bad as previous sets.

3	~Peace

3	very cool.

3	i'm getting this one as soon as its in america!

3	well maybe.

3	depends on how much money I have.

3	;-) Quote I stopped by the TRU in Portland, OR

3	i got most of the sets from '07, they're pretty cool.

3	Thanks for the review, it's a neat little set.

3	I hope it comes to Australia sooner rather than later.

3	That minifig head was also used in 7699 MT-101 so that may be why it seems familiar.

2	Ah.

2	But I think where I did see it is the lego Magazine, in the article on Biff Barker.

3	Thanks for the review!

3	*sweet* Aside from the fact that I like the model, this set has a few new and useful pieces so I will have to get it!

3	*wub*

2	thanks for the review.

2	I still will not get this set.

2	Speechless about it

3	A wonderful set and, perhaps, as close to Classic Space as possible.

3	*y* Also there?s a great amount of very useful and interesting parts too like these round 'stabilizer' parts with clip.... :'-) There?s a complete different feeling with this new sets compared to the first MM ones.... 8-| Beside the a little more realistic aspects of it with the more enclosed cockpit (nearly with some controls.... ;-) ) it?s the overall more solid feeling I guess....

3	The other sets look pretty neat and fashionable at the surface, but their internal structure is much more hollow and useless with some studless technic beams and such stuff.... very shining, but hard and boring to MOD, just aimed for maximal cool looking box art and the rest went down for saving costs.... (beside that already pretty good 7692 Dropship that is).

3	The only thing I don?t get with that is why the minirobot?s a one-armed one.... ach, Pirates on Mars I suppose.... X-D

3	that head might have been from rock raiders.

3	lovely set, and a good review.

3	jifel

2	Hmm, not actually a bad set.

2	Not high on my 'to buy' list, there're other things up there first, but definitely a possibility somewhere down the line.

2	Thanks for the review.

1	Great review, but am I the only one who thinks this is a pretty homely looking vehicle?

1	The small exploration robot is cool, but the large windscreen on the main vehicle reminds me about Jack Stone!

1	I also think the bases of the vehicle parts are very basic and look almost unfinished with the holes and such.

1	I think I will pass this one, even though the alien has a jet pack and there is the nice mini vehicle.

1	Tks for the great review MM ;-) Its always appreciated to have reviews of new set.

1	Having said that I really don't see the point of that set and its such money and time wasted IMO.

1	I don't like that theme apart the dropship and 6wheeler and that tiny vehicle doesn't do the trick for me.

1	I see it as a really cheap excuse to try and please Classic Space fan with that horrendous MM graphics and what amazes me is that you guys loke that :-D Money saved On !!

1	*yoda*

1	Ah, thanks so much again, Mr. M!

1	This set looks great!

1	I probably won't get this though.

1	I hat MM as far as it goes.

1	I agree with xwingyoda on this one.

1	Does the minibots wheels move?

3	X-D :-D Hilarious Actually.......However its imapled to it, so I guess its a suicide mission :-D Piranha

3	Thanks for posting the picture of this new MM set.

3	When I first saw the Mars Mission sets I was a little apprehensive about the design and the aliens (They could have at least make movable arms :(), but anyways when I bought the small fighter I was totally hook.

3	My fave set from the line is the mech.

3	During the annual Thanksgiving Road Trip to the relatives, I stopped by the TRU in Portland, OR.

3	Lo and behold, the new Mars Mission sets!

3	Predictably, I bought them.

3	I present to you: the MX-41 Switch Fighter!

3	Man, what a long name.

3	The box: Standard MM.

3	On the front, it shows the Fighter in flight mode, and a yellow note telling you that it transforms.

3	The back shows three pictures showing it happen.

3	The parts: Once I open the box, the first thing that comes out is a bent and rolled up instruction booklet, and I was forced to put it under a stack of beer books for an hour.

3	Then, there's the DSS.

3	Yes, two of the stickers do feature a cobra.

3	I wonder why, because this set's decal should be a beatle.

3	X-D Decent parts, nothing too special.

3	Then, I noticed this little part.

3	It's used for the flick-missiles, but I have no idea what else it would be used for.

3	:-/ The Build: The alien ship: When I looked at the box art for this set, I was releived to see that the aliens don't have another curved-forward wing ship.

3	Instead, they have this little beauty, which appears to be the Alien Mini Cooper- small and hot.

3	*wub* Anyway, partially completed.

3	Even if you don't like the set, it has some nice green flame peices, which work nicely for space laser swords.

3	Fully completed.

3	The only annoying bit about it is that the crystal-holding thing in front wobbles all over the place.

3	The alien fits into it by way of impalement.

3	It must hurt getting in and out.

3	Switch fighter (cockpit): The set makes good use of the Alpha Team cockpit.

3	For controls, it has a meagre handlebar that the astronaught can't even reach.

3	The rear "shell" of the fighter starts out around the alien containment chamber.

3	It's a bit odd that the containment chamber has an alien sticker, because the instruction booklet lists it as holding crystals.

3	The crystal canister is held back by a technic pin.

3	This is, without a doubt, the ugliest color arrangment EVER.

3	Warning: Mass stickers.

3	:-X The cockpit fits into grooves in the "shell".

3	Then it clicks into place in a 1x1 brick with a horizontal clip.

3	The wing "mechanism": The wing.

3	For some reason, the body of the "mechanism" has a blue brick.

3	*wacko* The wing and "mechanism" connect to prevent the fighter doing a nosedive while in tank mode.

3	The wing "mechanism" completed: The underside: The body and wing connect by way of a miscolored red brick.

3	I have no idea why it's red- black would bave been much, much better.

3	Completed.

3	Tank mode: All in all, this looks pretty neat.

3	The wheel base is pretty short, but it's not bad.

3	Transform!

3	The set transforms neatly, if ungainly.

3	Without "Anti-grav" support, it would fall forward on it's nose each time it transformed.

3	Jet mode.

3	It's all right, but it could be a bit better.

3	The "shell" keeps slipping back forward to the "tank mode" because there's nothing to stop it sliding.

3	Spare parts: Overall: I thought this set was great.

3	It could do with some fixing, such as the mismatched colors, but it should be a definate buy for MM fans.

3	Brickshelf Gallery (When available)

3	cool review.

3	I'm actually liking that new missile part as it seems to combine a bar with a pin.

3	But it's a real eyesore if you ask me.

2	*wub* Thanks for another great review.

2	*sweet* I am also glad that it is a very different alien fighter design as I already have three varients of the old type!

2	The fighter transforms better than I thought it would; I was expecting just the wings.

2	I should be buying this set as well... Mr. Mandalorian, on Nov 26 2007, 03:45 PM, said: Without "Anti-grav" support, it would fall forward on it's nose each time it transformed.

2	Well, since anti-grav doesn't exist, and will never exist, there has to be another option!

2	Looking at it in tank mode it does have a vague aerofoil shape so I think it should be able to work as a lifting body.

2	All it needs to do then is move fast enough to start taking off and then it can extend the wings... 8-|

2	Great review!

2	"How can it support itself without anti-grav while transforming?"

2	The answer?

2	It can't *sweet* :-P

1	Hmm, Its actually a nice bit better than I expected, and great review, thanks!

1	But think ill pass on this one.

1	I quite like the alien fighter though, heh.

1	And loved the way you described how he sat in the cockpit.

3	Very cool review, Mr. Mandalorian!

3	This isn't a bad set, the alien craft is very sleek (if only they'd gone with the old alien body in trans-green...) and the transforming is alright.

3	The tank mode looks sweet.

3	*sweet* ~Peace

2	after seeing this set review it change my mind about this set.

2	By the way thanks for the great review.

3	Thanks for that very good review, Mr. Mandalorian!

3	*y* I think that this is a plain beautiful set, oh how I wish that TLC would?ve taken that direction from the beginning.... :'-) The design is much more practicable, with fewer non-system parts and technic beams with(!)

3	studs.... this makes everything much more easier to MOD and a lot more useful, at least IMO.

3	*y* So it?s for sure not very hard to make the (wonderful enclosed) cockpit one brick higher, and even that little Alien Ship looks decent and nice.... X-O And the fighter looks sleek and elegant too, in both modes!

3	That?s just very cool, compliments, TLC.

3	Now all we need?re aliens with moving arms and here we go, Classic Space on forever!

3	X-D

3	Thanks for a very thorough review.

3	I might think about getting this.

3	I really like the mini alien fighter, and the transformation idea is always a welcome one.

3	Both modes look pretty good, despite the some of the odd coloured bricks (which I'd MOD out).

3	You know what it reminds me of?

3	Some of the futuristic designs in the Gerry Anderson series.

3	Wow.

3	This is actually quite a neat set!

3	It is definitively my favorite in the line after the big drilling unit!

3	\begin{geek} I'm not sure it would nose dive when transforming from tank mode.

3	I guess it would pick up speed and transform quickly since it doesn't seem to have any downwards pointing thrusters.

3	\end{geek}

3	friggin sweet, Thank you mr mandy for the reveiw of this sweet ship!

3	*y* *wub*

1	hmmm, I doubt I'll be getting this set.

1	Good review though.

3	I really like the transforming aspect of this!

3	The one thing I wish MM sets would include would be baseplates.

3	I liked that about the classic space stuff because it really helped create the environment.

3	Some "Red Rock Orange" Mars Baseplates would be great!

3	Hmmm, great review for a great set.

2	I guess it would pick up speed and transform quickly since it doesn't seem to have any downwards pointing thrusters.

2	The one thing you'd have to make sure of, though, is that it was fairly light and the wheel base had a fairly large surface area (actually, that's two things), so as to make sure it didn't dig into the soil.

2	If that happened, transformation would be harder as the wheels would dig into the ground and drag through the soil.

2	Then it'd nose dive.

1	Great review Mr Mandalorian!

1	*y* I'm not a fan of MM and don't like this set much, but it has some neat features.

1	But the only way I can see it transforming is by racing off a cliff and swinging its wings out *wacko* To the Brickmobile!

1	>:-)

1	and another tks and congrats MM on that review !!

1	Like the o?her post I think that this set is a wastre of time and money and shelfspace.

1	Its such a ripp off from that ugly Alfa Team crapjet.

1	I do not like the design of the jet itself: the small flags as front is so lame !!

1	And I don't like those orange wheels as engines !!

1	Furthermore I don't like the "rover" mode either !!

1	The only cool thing about it is the special martian jet which they should ahve sold separatly :-P At least some interesting parts but that far from saving that set IMO |-/ Money Saved On once again :-P *yoda*

3	A needed solution to those blasted flick missles from falling out while swooshing.

3	*sweet* Wonder if the range might have an issue seeing it's held in there but who knows, maybe they now "pop" out with a greater velocity than a mere finger flick?

3	I had resorted to technic 1/2 bushings (smooth) to lock in the missile's technic axle (with stud).

3	Great review, Mr. M!

3	*y* I *wub* those green flames, and the design of the ship is pretty good.

3	Comic and rating will be up shortly!

3	And hopefully more reviews too... :-)

3	Yes, finally!!!!

3	Is there a chance I can ever be in one of your ever so loved comics?

3	I just read it and so far so good in the 08 EF line.

2	I can't wait to see.

2	8-|

3	awesome.

3	i can't wait to get my hands on this one.

3	Great review Hinckley!

3	I know you've been busy, so thank you so much for getting this up!

3	:-D The spine construction is clever, the minirobot's cool, this is a fantastic set!

3	~Peace

3	Sweeeet.

3	*wub* It's nice to finally see a set that's not bipedal or (?)

3	Tripedal.

3	Quote Exo-Force is an anomaly in my LEGO interests.

3	I don't know why I like it so much or why I keep buying it but I do.

3	That would be a problem, wouldn't it?

3	:-P Quote The cockpit itself is constructed very well but the canopy seems like an afterthought, closing on to the robot's head and leaving his back and sides completely exposed.

3	I dunno.

3	At least it has a canopy, unlike past sets..

3	Thanks Hinckley!

3	It's always nice to see your reviews, and I can't wait to see the story mode (from the pic, I guess it will include Sinner and Hinckley, instead of Bianca and Gavin, right?

3	8-| ) LuxorV

3	Thanks for this fantastic review Hinckley, I can't wait to see the comic!

3	:'-) I REALLY love this mech as I am a fan of non-bipedal mechs (though I am terrible at making them), the purple is great and I can't wait to see what MOCers will use those awesome new spike peices for!

3	3 robots in one mech is a really good deal too, and that spider droid just adds so much more to the set.

3	And thanks for taking the time to do this!

3	*sweet* Not to sound like a smartypants though, but the grill peice in purple is not the first time this has happened, two were included in the 06 Joker Helicopter ;-) Thanks again!

3	To the Brickmobile!

3	>:-)

3	Awesome Reveiw thanks for the pics!!

3	Did the instructions come with a comic?

3	Thanks for that very neat review, Hinckley!

3	*y* This set looks indeed very interesting, with a very cool antlike look and a simple but essential overall design.

3	The cockpit seems better protected than many other EF ones, that spine?s lovely and the way these Iron Drones?re attached is simple but effective.

3	:-) And hey, did I miss something or?re there really no crappy shooting devices...?

3	:-P Thanks to the minirobots and their inventor I guess.... :'-)

2	Great Review!

2	*y* I am sure to get this set for parts now.

2	His legs dont look very poseable... :-/ Thanks Hinck!

2	~VBBN~

3	Great review as always, Hinckley.

3	Frankly I'm in love with this thing.

3	So much so, in fact, that I've been calling it 'Shadow Panther' for weeks, but never mind...

3	Anyway, why do I like it?

3	Well, purple is such a fantastic Lego colour- it's sparingly used, which makes it interesting, and it simply looks great.

3	Those jetpack/backpack things the robots are wearing, and if they are jetpacks, as the back of the box suggests, then the use of chaisaws is quite nifty and innovative.

3	The minibot is cool, and certainly an interesting gimmick.

3	Sure, they don't look quite as good in some of the other sets, but here it looks great.

3	The overall structure and design are cool too.

3	It's always nice to see an 'irregular' mech, and this is no exception.

3	It's especially cool whee the spines are concerned.

3	Plus, on top of all that, it's got a nice selection of parts, including some lovely new ones, and the inlaid box is interesting.

3	Well worth getting, I think.

3	Another fantastic review, Hinckley.

3	I really like this set, I wasn't to keen on it when I first saw the pictures bit having seen the review, I am starting to like it.

3	It seems quite sturdy, and it makes a change from the usual 2 legged mechs.

3	As well as that purple is welcome anywhere, I have such a shortage of that colour!

3	I like the rusty orange colour of the robots, and their back/jet packs are quite cool, and the mini robot looks sweet.

2	Thanks everyone!

2	I'm glad you are enjoying the review.

2	I'm working on the 8118 right now and will have comics up for both starting tonight.

2	The instructions do not have a comic, but I always write one for my reviews featuring my sig-fig or other Fabuland creatures interacting with the new set...

2	Hinckley, on Nov 27 2007, 07:47 PM, said: Thanks everyone!

2	I'm glad you are enjoying the review.

2	I'm working on the 8118 right now and will have comics up for both starting tonight.

2	The instructions do not have a comic, but I always write one for my reviews featuring my sig-fig or other Fabuland creatures interacting with the new set...

2	Translation: Interacting=Whacking!

2	Fabuland creatures: Sinner, Copmike and Yoda usually!

2	X-D ;-)

2	Don't forget Bianca and Gavin, o' Lordship of Pies!

2	:-D Truly another excellent review!

2	The pictures are absolutely splendid, as usual!

2	I'm really glad those air-vent pieces were done so well.

2	While I remain skeptical about the new giant spikes, you've sold me on this set!

2	I can't wait to see the Fabuland comic and your final verdict, Hink!

2	Whenever I click on any of the thumbnails, I get an error.

3	That's a very interesting set... and with all that purple a must buy.

3	I decided recently that I am going to resist buying Lego unless it's on sale next year, but I have so little purple.... 8-| I love the little robot!

3	:-P Thanks for the photos Hinckley and I look forward to the comic!

3	*sweet* (As Sir Dillon said, some of the links appear dead but I suspect it is a server error... :-/ )

2	I too got an error message when clicking on the images, but the text links work correctly 8-| I wonder which way Gavin will meet his death this time :-D LuxorV

2	Thanks for pointing that out guys.

2	It should work now... :-$

2	8118 Hybrid Rescue Tank Review Enjoy guys!

2	I am working on more.

2	Maybe we'll have the 8112 Battle Arachnoid next.

2	The comics will be around eventually.

2	Sorry for all the delays and the teasing.

2	I appreciate your patience!

2	!

2	Hah screw patience!

2	You're the best Hink!

2	I can't wait for the comics.

3	caant wait for all of these sets to show up in the u.s.

2	Great Almost finished review *y* Thanks for doing these, since you are probably busy However my favorite part is missing, The comic!!

2	:-D Interesting set, however I never liked exoforce but I like the parts Wait On!

2	Dark Sword Ragnarok, on Nov 27 2007, 08:08 PM, said: sweet.

2	caant wait for all of these sets to show up in the u.s. uh... he got that in the US.

2	From the LEGO Store in Chicago, if I recall his post properly!

2	My goodness Hink, you're going to pull an all-nighter for reviews at this rate!

2	Oh well, it's kinda worth it, right?

2	:-P

3	Another great review, Hink!

3	Looks like a great set.

3	Quote The cockpit isn't sealed and is actually aggravatingly unrealistic as it leaves the drivers chest vulnerable to enemy fire.

3	Actually the cockpit lacks any controls as seen here where it looks like Keiken is simply pounding a counter demanding food.

3	:-D "Gimme food!

3	Or else my friend up there willl shoot your punk- @$$ into mars!"

3	Well, I guess that explains why there are no robot snipers in EF.

3	If there were, well.... Wouldn't be much of a story, would there?

3	X-D

2	Darnit, Hinckley!

2	>:-( You always make us wait for the comic, which is almost everyones favorite part!

2	>:-( |-/ X-D I just noticed Ryos uniform had a camo pattern.

2	With all the orange he has, it's kinda pointless.

2	Edited by Lt. Veers, 28 November 2007 - 04:48 AM.

2	this designers were on a roll with this one until it came to the flying unit.

2	It looks like a shambles, epecially the guns looking rather simplistic.

2	Although they used something similar to the light and sound globe peice, which is kind of neat.

2	I dont think I'll be buying this but your review almost talked me into it.

2	But my reviews are not meant to sway anyone.

2	They should just inform people further as if they want to buy it or not.

2	I am not necessarily for encouraging anyone to buy every set I review.

2	:-D But I'm glad you liked it.

2	Thank you.

2	And actually I did feel the same way you did about the flying module, until I put Sinner in it and started to play.

2	Here's a sneak peek of the comic and a cool feature of Ryo's ship-it can be configured in a lot of different ways:

3	This one is much better than I thought; I didn't expect the gun and the "turret" to be geared!

3	I agree that a lot of the details sux (hollow inside, lame cockpits...) but as an overall package it looks quite good.

3	The best part is.... no shooter!

3	Is the nightmare finally over?

3	:'-) The bonus robot is a much better idea.

3	The large amount of blue pieces make this a must buy for me as Impartial needs more raw materials!

3	:-P How well do the tracks work?

3	The last tank was too light and it didn't roll well at all.

3	:-/ Thanks for these photos as well Hinckley.

3	*wub* So far the 08 Exo-Force sets are looking good!

3	*sweet* Hinckley, on Nov 28 2007, 04:48 PM, said: And actually I did feel the same way you did about the flying module, until I put Sinner in it and started to play.

3	:-P Wow!

3	It's big enough for my big walrus head!

2	Sinner, on Nov 28 2007, 12:53 AM, said: How well do the tracks work?

2	The last tank was too light and it didn't roll well at all.

2	:-/ It's similar in weight but I didn't have to press down so hard to get the treads to move, barely at all, really.

2	I think the Mobile Defense Tank, although a better overall design, suffered from the odd angle of the treads and that was mostly why the treads didn't turn well.

2	Plus, what was with those weird exhaust pipes??

2	Anyway, they are both cool tanks although I like the Mobile Defense Tank better... :-)

3	Thank you for the glimps at the new set Hinckley *y* .

3	I saw this set today at my local TRU store.

3	The new slope 1x2 pieces look very *sweet* .

3	I definitly see great potential for these pieces on locomotives.

3	I hope these are going to be bountiful in the 2008 lines.

3	Model On!

3	!

1	Fantastic!

1	Great review, thanks a bunch for all the pics, they've shown me how (in my opinion) bad this set is.

1	:-P I just expected it to be more bricky rather than technicy.

1	Oh well, I wasn't planning on buying it anyway.

1	X-D I noticed you spelt mini-figs mini-fgis in the first paragraph, in case you wanted to know.

1	X-D So again, thanks, and I'm looking forward to seeing the rest of them, and the comics!

3	Thanks for this great review Hinckley!

3	:'-) I know you're loving this attention!

3	X-D :-P I actually like this set, and like it a lot more now that I've seen this review.

3	I'll most likely get, mostly for the figs and parts.

3	I reckon it would look a lot better alongside the rest of the 2008 EF mechs.

3	Anyway, thanks for the review!

3	To the Brickmobile!

3	>:-)

2	Thanks for this other great review, Hinckley *y* !

2	You sure you don't work as one of TLC's PRs?

2	X-D ;-) Everytime I see one of your reviews I want to buy the set, and that is sweet to me, but bad for my money 8-| LuxorV

3	Thanks for that good review, Hinckley.

3	*y* A really interesting set and a turning point for LEGO.

3	Minirobots instead of shooting crap, pretty cool.

3	I hope the kids?ll like it too.

3	For the design, I love that asymmetrical look of the front part and the sleek guns of the flyer.

3	It?s smart that the gatling gun moves along with the tank, too.

3	The set idea with two vehicles in one?s not new, but very play- able and the treads/big wheel design?s cool.

3	I don?t like the use of studless technic beams, but well, they do their job I guess.

3	And Keiken?s cockpit should be easy to improve....

2	Asuka, on Nov 28 2007, 02:41 PM, said: For the design, I love that asymmetrical look of the front part and the sleek guns of the flyer.

2	The asymmetry reminds me of the Wookie vehicles in StarWars Battlegrounds... *y* And I see they changed back to the first color schemes for minifig suits, which I think where better than the dark suits of 2007 (except for Hikaru's *wub* ) LuxorV

2	Can't wait for the extended review!!

2	;-)

2	Thank you for the review Hinckley :-) Already waiting for the comic X-D

3	Some of you might know that I'm not a big fan of exo-force, but this set is an exception.

3	This looks like a futurist tank.

3	My kids would love this.... if I should have any :-D As always, very professional review Hinckley!

2	I think this is probably my least favourite set of next years selection, but I still might get it, partly because of this review (thanks, btw).

2	I quite like the mini-robot, and while there are a few problems (the front cockpit, the exposed axles) I relish the idea of MODing them out, and correcting them.

2	And the change back to the original figs is welcome.

2	I didn't really get any of this years sets, only last years.

2	Makes it easier from a MOCing potential, anyway.

3	crap!

3	>:-( now i have to spend all my money on this!

3	*wub* *wub* and whats the code?

2	I have put Fabuland Housewives on the back burner for a while, but plan to revive it for the first season conclusion in January.

2	It's nice to see that there are people who really follow it out there.

2	Thanks!

2	8112 Battle Arachnoid Review I've opted to do another set review instead of getting the comics up.

2	I don't want anyone to beat me to the reviews.

2	So, thanks for your patience and enjoy the review.

2	The comics will be up in due time.

2	Thanks!

2	:-$

3	Thanks for this new review, Hinckley *wub* For me, it was love at fistr sight with this little set :-P It's simple but nice, and way better than Shadow Crawler for a spider-like mech *y* You sure will be very busy these days, and your characters will get breakdown before they finish filming all the comics X-D LuxorV

3	Thanks for that neat review of a very nice set.

3	The color scheme?s great and that minirobot looks very comical and funny indeed, sweet!

3	*sweet*

3	Awesome!

3	Thanks Hinckley!

3	I was not planning to get this set but now it look as if I will have too.

3	(I still cannot afford it anyway) :'-(

3	i would agree.

3	the spider looks really cool.

3	too bad we can't see how the combo mech looks like.

3	instructions are not online yet.

3	:-/ there should be another combo mech but you'll need the storm lasher set.

3	:-P

3	Hinkley, you are the MAN!

3	Your reviews just keep on getting better and better!

3	Although all of the sets this year are great and I love them all to bits, I can't say there was one that I absolutely felt like something I'd buy except for the Storm Lasher.

3	But with this review, I think this will be the first purchase of 2008 for me!

3	I totally agree with you on how the Spider looks better without Mini-robot.

3	But from looking at where the cockpit is placed and how the skull on the cockpit is lodged underneath the walker, maybe the mini-robot would look better mounted underneath the head?

3	That way it looks more even and even gives the thing a nasty set of teeth!

3	I gotta try it out once I get it.

3	Can't wait for the Fabuland comics!

3	Keep it up, Hink!

2	Hinckley, on Dec 6 2007, 04:56 AM, said: honckly?

2	wow, dude.

2	:-/ Well, at least you got the c and the k. Of course, the e is missing.

2	It's all right though.

2	Eight letter words can be challenging :-P That's always the case for me.

2	Although, I have the Assault Tiger and will start on it next.

2	On the box it looks like it is wearing huge bell bottoms.

2	:-D I want to get the Chameleon Hunter, I really like the look of it and forgot to pick it up.

2	Guess I'll have to go back to TRU!

2	:-$ Cross your fingers that I find more Indy sets!

2	zero1312, on Dec 5 2007, 05:27 PM, said: Wow, nice review.

2	*y* But I have a question: Where can I find these "ork sets" everyone is refering to because of these swords in the rotors.

2	:-/ Are you talking about the Dwarves Mine?

2	*sweet*

3	cool!

3	another *y* *y* *y* *y* *y* *y* out of *y* *y* *y* *y* *y* and could you post a pic of all the minirobots and planes

1	thanks for the review, although I still have no intentions of buying this, it's neat to know what's inside, the build etc... (the etc being the comic ;-) X-D ) It's wierd because I dont know what it is I dont like about this set.

1	Exo-builder59, on Dec 6 2007, 01:30 AM, said: Are you talking about the Dwarves Mine?

1	*sweet* Yes, when in 2008 do these sets come to Germany?

1	:-/

3	Oh, I just *wub* theat mini-bot.

3	Creepy, but strangely cute... Nice piece selection, and the idea of something with rotors that double up as cutters storming (no pun intended) through the jungle ripping it apart is just fantastic (to me, anyway).

3	I'm liking the new swords as rotors blades, that's pretty innovative, and the exhaust pipe pieces are intriguing.

3	Thanks for the review, Hinckley!

3	I like the set it looks good, and all those ork swords..... *wub*

3	Here is my review of the set 6265 Sabre Island!

3	Overview: Sabre Island was release in 1990 an it contained 92 pieces and its retail price was $15.50.

3	It comes with 3 Imperial Blue coats, and a nice outpost for them.

3	The pictures + full review: Anyway, you can see here a picture of the box, the model shown on the box differs from the actual model slightly.

3	...And the back of the box, which shows some nice alternative models from the pieces provided.

3	A close up of two or three of the alternative models.

3	And now for the minifigs.

3	I prefer the Red coats over the Blue coats but these minifigs are nice, and for the number of pieces one gets a fair amount of them.

3	The set itself makes a nice small outpost, it comes complete with a palm tree, a cannon (with ammo) on a turntable, a small tower a nice large Imperial flag and a little red row boat!

3	Here is a shot from ground level showing the cannon and Blue coat (patrolling the out post!)

3	The rowing boat was a nice touch, and it comes with a small flag too.

3	"No Pirates will avoid the wrath of myself and my mighty Island!"

3	The top of the tower is rather plain and simple which in some ways is good, as it keeps the whole set detailed yet not crowded, but I feel a little something should of been added to the top though.

3	The back is lacking any type of walls, so one can play with the minifigs inside, yet their are also no stairs or any other ways for the Blue Coats to climb up their tower either!

3	The rag tag pirates attack Sabre Island!

3	But never fear, The Lord Of Pies is here!

3	Me throwing a pie at Captain Ironhook from another angle.

3	Overall I think this is a very good, if somewhat simple set, and makes a great cheap Imperial set!

3	Comments, thoughts and Opinions are welcome!

3	(And sorry about the darkness in some photos, I have not had time to take photographs when it is till light recently, for when I return home it is dark |-/ ) Edit: Fixed, Thank you!

3	Edited by Phred, 12 April 2015 - 05:14 AM.

3	Fantastic review!

3	I'll post my views on the set later when I have more time.

3	But I've already fixed the poll.

3	Nice review!

3	Hmm...I gave it a 4...Why?

3	Very good bits: -3 epaulettes for 3 gurads!

3	-Patterned wall parts -Cannon Bad bits: -No pirates to fight -Title is rather grand for an outpost -Top needs battlements, not very low lattices -Needs a more substantial base - the wall goes right into the sea!

3	- Surely the whole thing would sink... -Palm tree is too short ...and the rest is good!

3	:-P You might want to fix the vote option for 5 - it appears to be the title; you can't vote for it... Pirate King Skelly Killer Edit: OK, Boney, but I gave it a 4!

3	Splendid review.

3	I also own this one, and I think there's nothing to complain about.

3	(more figs would be appreciated though, a sneaky pirate perhaps) 4 out of 5!

3	Thanks for that nice review, it?s a 5 for me.... just a great little Blue coats set, perfect for army and fortress building.

3	*sweet*

3	I remember buying this set and thinking what an amazing job LEGO had done.

3	It was my first Pirate set and I still have it built.

3	*sweet*

3	I gave it a 5, it has some nice pieces at a reasonable price.

3	Thanks for this review, and the pictures are great!

3	*sweet*

3	Thank you for the comments!

3	*sweet* I wonder who voted "1", surely such a nice set doesn't deserve such a low score!?

3	*wacko*

3	It's not a bad thing to vote Sabre Island 1 if someone feels that it's genuinely worth 1 but t'would be interesting to know why.

3	Mister Phes, on Dec 8 2007, 07:47 PM, said: It's not a bad thing to vote Sabre Island 1 if someone feels that it's genuinely worth 1but t'would be interesting to know why.

3	I do see your point Mr Phes, but 1?

3	I would like to know why he/she thinks Sabre Island is worth so little!

3	I gave this one a 5.

3	It's one of the little pirate sets I had during my youth and I loved it for several reasons.

3	First of all, it contains 2 of my favorite minifigs!

3	It can be used as a small independent base or in combination with one of the bigger sets (Eldorado or Trading posts) as a lookup or outer defense.

3	Besides all that, this set just looks beautiful.

3	I love the colors (blue baseplate and the white/yellow tower).

3	One of the best little/medium sized sets ever made by Lego!

3	I give it a 4, only because there are no pirates.

3	I aways loved this set, nice little fortifaction.

3	Lots of details.

3	I only wish I could have worked it in Aberbrick.

2	Remind us what Aberbrick is Mr Radar... Or better still give us a link and give your MOC plug X-D

2	I will post pics of the results one day if all goes to plan.

2	Steve Hmm, maybe, although a catapult doesn't really fit in to that time period all that well.

2	Did I hear right?

2	A catapult in the 16th/17th/18th and 19th centuries?

2	*wacko* Perhaps it's an appeal for Lord of Pies to have his own personal catapult to pelt the pirates with whipped cream pastries should they try to sail past.

2	But this begs the question... why waste perfectly good pie on those scurvy, mangy, mutt-faced villians!

2	There's plenty of stale, moldy old, maggot infested grog around Eldorado Fortress, perhaps that's worth wasting on the scurvy sea-dogs afterall my men have taken to eating only coconuts brought by Islander girls in their skimpy undies!

2	X-D

3	its a fantastic set, cant think of anything wrong with it to be honest, even if the island is a bit small, the plate itself is still useful, and the rest of it is also very useful, walls can go toward a bigger fort, cannon can extend your ship, soldiers extend your army, boat extends err your boats, and the island prin is just cool

3	Its a nice set.

3	I would not mind owning one, just for the minifigs and cannon.

3	The base plate is pretty cool as well.

3	Nice review, I gave it a 4 out of 5.

3	INDEXED I'm going to have to start dodging cannon balls soon if i don't start making some pirate mocs.

3	*pirate* Anywayz, I've had my Shell Service Station set # 6378 built exactly by "the book" and sitting around for the longest time.

3	With the recent twinning of my "town" with Dr. Sinister, I needed a gas station that could handle a lot more traffic (especially military traffic and these new 6-wide vehicles X-D ).

3	Here be a thumblink to the original station at BL: I love this station so much, but it really needed some modernization.

3	The reopening of this station received a lot of attention, even the local police stopped right over.

3	One big upgrade to this station is the selling of propane tanks, which is generally a rare commodity from the lego towns i've seen.

3	X-D Also at this service station is a propane tank refilling station.

3	The milkman is our first propane customer.

3	The interior has also had an addition and many upgrades.

3	For instance, this building now has florescent lighting, a big frig in the back, and more shelf space.

3	*y* Oh look!

3	there's the officer purchasing a mountain dew.

3	Now that there's more shelf space, we can sell more than just 1x1 round yellow bricks and levers.

3	We now have available 1x1 round plates and 1x1 round cones available in multiple colors!

3	:-D With this upgraded gas station, hopefully this town will bring in more business and customers into my small town.

3	X-D P

3	:'-) I really love everything you did with this gas station.

3	It looks very cozy!!!

3	Amazing how you said you built it by the book, does that mean you didn't have the set but you used your own pieces to rebuild the thing?

3	The flourescent lighting is genius!

3	And the interior space looks just like what you'd see at those little shops.

3	I really dig the moc ;-) it gives me good ideas and now I want a gas station of my own :-P And the history behind how it was "rebuilt" and how it will improve business etc is so cool *wub*

3	... Thanx legobear.

3	It means that i have the complete set and have kept it complete until yesterday X-D Since i like the set so much, i wanted to keep the general look of it :-) P Edited by phred, 09 December 2007 - 06:27 AM.

3	Great Moc!

3	It seems you did the math when doing this one and hit the nail on the head (Which pierced a megablock causing it to self destruct) !

3	Stauder

3	That?s a be-au-ti-ful station!

3	It looks perfect from head to toe ;) You managed to keep the original feeling, yet enhanced it to match the spirit of todays city sets.

3	Congratulations!

3	And I love your Milkman Truck!

3	:D

3	That's a beautiful upgrade of a classic set!

3	The new interior is great.

3	*wub* Do you still have the tow truck?

3	A wonderful work and a neat idea with that propane tank refilling station.

3	*y* Very detailed and very charming indeed!

3	:'-)

3	NIce station Phred, love those fluorescent lights!

3	*wub* But...start dodging cannonballs now, boom, harr!

2	Thanx for the compliments :-$ Stauder, on Dec 9 2007, 01:47 AM, said: ... (Which pierced a megablock causing it to self destruct) !

2	Stauder YES!

2	Any destruction of a megablock is a good thing.

2	Thanx Stauder.

2	I definitely still have the truck *wub* I don't have the heart to destroy it :'-) Captain green hair, on Dec 9 2007, 11:54 AM, said: ...

3	Thank you Big Pete *wub* This set looks very good, it looks well built and the statues are nice.

3	The ark looks great and the Star Wars hieroglyphic is classic :-D Just a two things: Is Marion's face double sided?

3	It looks like a calm face on the back of the box.

3	Where do the snakes come out?

3	And about the stickers, have you tried putting them on the long bricks above the breakable walls?

3	Once again, thanks very much *wub* *y*

2	I never noticed until I just checked!

2	:-$ Will post a pic of the alternate face when my camera battery is charged :) Quote Where do the snakes come out?

2	They sit on a pivoting plate behind the Star Wars heiroglyphics.

2	You press down on a brick at the back and the plate drops and they fall out from underneath.

2	Quote And about the stickers, have you tried putting them on the long bricks above the breakable walls?

2	well, yes ... that was where I guessed they were meant to go ... but really ... there is no mention of this in the instructions!

3	Great review!!

3	I love this set *wub* (Not only because of Marion though :-D ) It has the ark that is very cool , SW humor and lots of snakes A very cool set and perhaps my favorite so far *sweet* Damn, 3 out 4 Indy sets reviewed and isn't even 08 yet X-D P

3	Thanks for the review!

3	It looks awesome, and 10 snakes!

3	Is that box the Ark though?

3	Thanks again!

3	~Peace

3	OutStanding!

3	I can't believe you found one!

3	I'd bet Hinckley would be surprised about this.

2	Marion's other face!

3	Thank you for the great review!

3	Looks like a very nice set, so many snakes!

2	This is great, thanks for the review...but they're using a new skellie?

2	I thought those were just for the reanimated dead...not just skeletons.

2	Unless that skeleton is supposed to be reanimated?

2	Either way it makes me sad :'-( That marion is beautiful *wub* Worth it for the set alone!

2	And that SW reference is great X-D

3	Thanks for that cool review, Big Pete!

3	*y* A very interesting set with a great playability and that SW sticker?s just hilarious!

3	Snake shower on!

2	hollisbrick, on Dec 15 2007, 11:30 PM, said: could you take a photo of the ark?

2	thanks oh and the inside too pleese *sweet* The ark doesn't have an inside.

2	It's just one brick built box.

3	LOL!

3	Those Star Wars heiroglyphics are awesome!

3	Were those in the movie?

3	Or is this just a joke by the Lego designers?

3	That would be the first time TLC showed any kind of reference humor!

3	The rest of the set is great too, even the skeleton and the stickers.

3	YES, that's right, I actually like those things.

3	I like the new skellies because of their posability (I'm a big supporter & user of stop-motion) and I think there's nothing wrong with stickers.

3	I mean seriously, why does everybody hate stickers so much???

3	:-| Sure, they are a pain in the megablocks to put on and, sure, they come off after a while and are never usable again, but hey, you don't have to put them on, even better, you can save them (like I do) and use them for your mocs!

3	Could somebody tell me, please?

3	I'm just curious.

3	However, as I said, nice set!

3	I might even get one.

3	Gotta love that marion with the carot torch X-D and that arc is neat too!

3	By the way, are all parts on it golden?

3	Some more pics on it would be nice as soon as your camera is recharged!

2	Peace Out!

2	As far as I know, those insignias on the arc are in the movie, too.

2	But I don?t remember if they actually were on the arc or somewhere else.

2	There are a lot of Star Wars references in all the Indiana Jones movies.

2	Looking at your name, you might find it funny to know that the Asian club of Lao Che in Temple of Doom is called "Club Obi-Wan" The plane in the first Indy has the callsign CPO, which I just found out the other day :)

3	This and Motorcycle Chase were the two sets I've wanted from the start.

3	I like how you get lots of snakes, and I'll add my snakes in too, for a Brickfilm.

3	Sometimes I like the stickers, but all my world city ones got hard and fell off :'-( I like the R2-D2.

3	Could you take a pic of any hieroglyphics in this set(Not the ones on the sticker sheet.)

3	Thanks.

3	I want to decode them.

3	My 2nd review (what a veteran) ... again, found this set via a shop assistant, in my local TRU (Portsmouth, UK) this evening.

3	Comes in at ?44.99, which, is pretty steep, but, you get quite a bit for your money.

3	Front of the Box : Back of the Box : Back of the Box Closeup : Contents : It was a nice surprise to get numbered bags ... not had a large set with numbered bags for quite a while, at least in none of the sets I've bought recently!

3	Didn't take a close up of the stickers, but I was quite disappointed that the curved pieces had stickers ... if they could print the ATT curved pieces, why not these?

3	Minifigs : Oh ... and there's a nice backprint on the Pilot figure : Now, the build was pretty good ... you build the plane first (after the minifigures).

3	Quite an interesting build in a way, becayse for a while you think the back is the front ... and then you realise, heh!

3	Now ...

3	I've not seen the film in a while, but I don't recall a guy flying a plane with a fishing rod ... don't flame me if this is what happens, see earlier point regards not seeing the film in ages!!

3	:-P After that, you build the temple in stages, starting with the entrance first, and then the holey floor section with the spears.

3	These spears are just loosely placed into technic holed bricks.

3	Quite easy to make em flick out but they can go anywhere!

3	hehe Entrance : Holey Floor & Spears : These two parts are hinged and on an angle to each other and the gap makes for a handy bottomless pit, complete with pole for Indy to swing over with his whip.

3	After that, you create the door and the ratchet mechanism to keep it raised.

3	After that, you add the runners for the ball and the swinging knives trap.

3	Swords Trap - Before : After : Finally, you build the statue that holds the efigy.

3	Nice bit of construction here, especially the way that everything falls over once the efigy is removed.

3	Do be careful when putting the curved bits on though ... it appears one of the edges on mine has slightly bent when putting it on ... nowt noticable though.

3	Temple : Preparing to steal : Run!!

3	You can see that the temple has toppled and debris has fallen all around ... And then, as he goes through the door, the door falls (he gets his hat) and then the rock ball starts a rolling!

3	Ruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun!!

3	The stickers were a pain though ... there's no room for a border around the sticker here!

3	Beware!!

3	After all that is done, you join all the pieces together and it makes more a really good playset.

3	Plenty of opportunity for recreating scenes here!

3	Idol Closeup : Total Set : Spares : Yet more spare stickers??!

3	(sorry, i've already put the spares in my box of bits!)

3	Overall, 8 out of 10 ... lots of play value and a pretty nice build.

3	Too many stickers though ... and defo poor arms for the skeletons!

3	Thanks for that fine review, Big Pete!

3	*y* A really adventurous set with a good playability and neat traps!

3	That mayaesque sticker?s also very decent.

3	I think that the box art of these Indy sets is pretty cool too with all these 'action scene' pics, nicely done, TLC.

3	Overall, a very lovely set indeed.... tomb raiding on!

3	:'-)

3	Thank you for another excellent review Big Pete!

3	*y* *y*

3	Thank you very much for another great review, Big Pete *wub* This is a good set, but I probably won't be able to afford it with all of the rest of the lego coming out in 2008 |-/ Oh, I watched this scene a few weeks ago, and the pilot is fishing while waiting for Indy to escape.

3	Thanks again you lucky lucky man :-P

2	Thanks for the great review!

2	I'll probably be picking this one up if only for the minifigs (how can you not complete your Alfred Molina minifig collection?)

2	and the idol piece.

2	It's cheap too ... under ?20 for all three at the moment.

1	No hovitos?

1	NO!

1	Ah well, if I get more pirate sets next year i'd use the Islanders as hovitos.

1	In the video game they have the same torsos.

1	I'd really like to get this, maybe in June I'll have luck.

1	:'-)

2	this set is pretty nice i love the idol id probably buy the set just for that :-D lol is it just me or in the earlier concepts of this set we saw a native on the box?

2	i wonder why they removed it :-( *wacko*

3	Tks so much Big Pete for thisd awsome review of yet another fantastic Indy sets !!

3	Its clearly one of the best lines of all times with SW 8-?

3	That idol is superb and I love all the details of that set: loads of cool defense mechanisms, sweet vegetation and yeay another black carrot torch :-P And those MFs are really nice !!

3	I am so happy to see Lego go dark tan *wub* Now I clearly can't wait to enjoy building this set ;-) Fertility Idol On !!

3	*yoda*

2	i just noticed another inconsistency between box art and the actual set ... on the box, the biplan has white wing supports (they're just plane windows without glass in them) and yet the set they are dark grey (or is it bley ... can never tell the difference without careful study).

2	Add to that ... the outer of the engine at the front is white on the box and black in the set.

2	We don't normally have this many inconsistencies do we ?

2	This set is so cool... and another must buy!

2	:-$ I'm in trouble next year it seems...

2	The figs are great!

2	*wub* I think the plane is only OK; perhaps they should have made that in a separate set as it needed to be a certain size to fit the figs, but that meant that the tail is way too short.

2	Here is a picture of the actual plane so you can see what I mean.

2	(Notice the pilot is fishing... ;-) ) The temple is another story; I think Lego have done an incredible job with this, fitting in the key parts of this sequence without making an absurdly large model.

2	Addtionally, there are many parts in this set that I haven't got so it shouldn't be too hard to justify.

2	X-D Thanks for another great review.

2	*sweet* I love the photo of Indy running with the idol and the boulder close behind.

2	:-/ EDIT: Yes there was one... Big Pete, on Dec 16 2007, 11:28 PM, said: We don't normally have this many inconsistencies do we ?

2	Quite annoying ones too.

2	I think the plane looks better with those being white.

3	Because of exams and other obligations, I haven't posted this sooner.

3	Seeing that no-one else has reviewed this set, I thought I might as well do it myself.

3	The set in its entire glory (minus the slammer, instructions and the (obviously) massive sticker sheet) The four cars included in this set; a muscle car, a sports car, a roadster and the police off-roader(!

3	): Because the police obviously have no clue that an off-roader is useless for catching street-racers, no less a batmobile-ish sports car, it will always trail behind: But the police have a trick up their sleeve - the drawbridge: Gotcha!

3	And the mechanism that makes it all tick: The motor is nothing more than a (slow) pull-back motor.

3	Push down the bridge, the latch will hook on to the gear and keep it in place until the latch is released.

3	And there's the new gas station.

3	Staying within theme, this gas-station is, like the tanker in 8147, from the company Fuel 4 Speed: There's a notable presence of detail here, such as the soda-dispenser, water (coolant?)

3	bottles and other accesories, two fuel pumps and bumper-level railings to prevent cars from crashing into them.

3	There's no interior however.

3	And as demonstrated here by a loyal Octan-employee and a pursuing officer, the gas station is built to minifig-scale: My impressions of this set: As a collector of tiny turbos, and yet to miss a set, I got this one regardless of what it included.

3	The gas station is indeed very nice, and the minifig-scale accesories were unexpected.

3	The lack of interior is no big issue, and the both the station and bridge can with ease be implemented into a mini-fig town.

3	The bridge also solidly built, and includes the ramps in its design, so it can be lifted, with ramps attached, without breaking apart.

3	The slammer included in the set is identical, apart from the white color, with those in 8147.

3	The cars are also very nice, altough I am yet to get used to the yellow batmobile, as I've grown accustomed to calling it.

3	I also love the off-roader's chunky tires, they make perfect wheels for the newer minifig-scale cars.

3	I never consider price/parts ratio, and here it would, for me, be irrelevant, because it will never be demolished for parts.

3	The play value is what I would consider pretty good, and while the bridge won't rise with a car on it, it's still strong enough to stay open with a car tipping over the edge.

3	Hmm.

3	Every nerve in my body is saying that this sets is worth roughly 8/10, so: Verdict: 8/10 Edited by WhiteFang, 23 May 2009 - 07:01 PM.

3	Indexed

2	Looks like a nice set, I like the tiny turbos and have most of the older individual cars, but I am put off by the ever increasing price of the large sets with lots of extra parts that I'm not really interested in.

2	I wish these were available as individual vehicles as well.

3	Thanks for the review!

3	It's really cool that the petrol station is mini-fig scaled, I wasn't expecting that!

3	:-D ~Peace

3	It looks like a nice set but I'm not interested in the minis, it's got a nice drawbridge though!

3	Thanks!

3	*sweet*

2	I want this set but its $60 AUD which is a ripp off!

2	i like the yellow car!

2	*wub* :'-) *y* by the way good review!

2	*y*

2	Picked up from the Lego shop in Bluewater yesterday Front of Box Back of Box Price ?2.50 GBP Contents, a very small instruction manual Instructions (Front) Intsructions (Back) 25 Pieces (23 used in the model) Regular construction mini fig Start of the assembly Roll in the drum Just attach the drum A little tap with the hammer!

2	(hammer not included!)

2	Wheel it into position Time to start mixing, also time for a well earned Tea Break, The cement is all ready now.

2	And the 2 left over bits.

2	Extra cement is always useful and not really wasted.

2	Overall, a nice little set and I am pleased to see little sets appearing again at long last.

2	The only negative is with the drum of the mixer, although the angle can be adjusted you cannot tip the contents out of the mixer.

2	All in all I would say 8/10 for a good little set?

2	Comments...?

2	?

2	?

2	Edit by Hobbes: Replaced pictures with clickable thumbs and corrected set number.

3	great review and nice touch putting the minifig in the mixer *y* and i think you are the first to review this set so all in all good work.

3	steel...

1	Aww man!

1	I hate that face.

1	It doesn't match any of my other lego heads!

1	In my opinion, it's not even lego-ey.

2	Thanks for the review.

2	I will probably miss this set as I have too many workers already!

2	I have a few of this head...

2	It's one of the multipurpose heads, it's even been used as a viking!

2	*wacko*

2	Thanks for the very thorough review!

2	Looks good, but I see they didn't include the new 4x4x1/3 circle piece.

2	Ah well, did you see/buy any other Impulse sets?

2	~Peace

3	i tink its better if you resize the pics before uploading to ur brickshelf account.

3	Picasa2 is a good tool to resize ur pics.

3	use the "export" function.

3	;-) Anyway, nice review!

3	Looks like i will be getting all of the CITY impulse sets except for the Fire fighter one.

3	Maybe more of those Large Bin sets.

3	heh.. thanks for the pics!

3	Is it possible if you scan the rest of the sets at the back of the manual?

3	Thanks in advance!

3	:-D

2	Thanks for the review.

2	Does anyone know if these mini sets are sold at TRU?

3	OMG I absolutely love how you reviewed this set, I think you are the only person I've ever seen on Eurobrick with such a thorough review.

3	I read Eurobricks daily and this really raises the bar in terms of how a person does a review.

3	Please do not resize your pics, they are perfect, crisp, large, thorough, and clear; it gives anyone who really wants info on the set just about everything they need to know about it.

3	I had no idea they used that lil "thing" to have the cement mixer spin, cool idea ;-) .

3	Nice set, but perfect perfect review.

3	Thanks much!

3	X-D

2	Thanks for the review, this looks like a nice set to have multiple copies of...

2	I think that you may have mistyped the setnumber, as I was expecting this cute car when I read the title (I wondered how you could see a cementmixer in this set...) :-P

3	Heres all the parts in assorted baggies, and the horribly messed up instructions.

3	Four astronauts and four aliens, with an extra gold visor (yay!)

3	Not bad.

3	The base of the horribly unstable alien craft.

3	The wings move up and down, aswell as back and forth, the purpose I know not.

3	Next we build the nerf section of the base.

3	Basically technic.

3	And the rest of the tube connectors.

3	Heres the farthest I got the little missle to go.

3	Its fairly dissapointing.

3	Good thing I didnt expect much from this portion of the set.

3	Heres the start of the command base.

3	More of the main structure, will be adding lots of things to all the little beams.

3	Heres a storage container and the surprisingly not flimsy radar.

3	On this side we see the alien elevator.

3	It uses a HORRIBLY long technic rod, I have not seen one of this proportion, its like, a foot and a half long.

3	More of the inner base where all the little tubes shall go.

3	All the connected tubes and such.

3	I also encountered a problem.

3	In the instructions it says for the end of the elevator prong to be touching the tube connector where it is shown here, but mine has a 1x space inbetween.

3	No matter.

3	Heres the completed base.

3	+ My knee.

3	Again.

3	Onto the spaceship.

3	The bulk of it is just technic supporting beams, with some large slope peices covering it all up.

3	More on that later.

3	The white coverup.

3	The middle section lifts up to store the overly large jetpack.

3	As you see, the storage containers take up most the bulk in the back, and you can see the jetpack on the ground.

3	Aswell as the trigger hand hold thing that allows you to swoosh it.

3	Look, in the back!

3	Lego Greebles!

3	Despite the large cockpit, it only holds one person, laying down.

3	The wings are really the saving grace - double layered with a nice two toned effect.

3	Kitty nudged me this picture so its abit blurry, my apologies :-| Extra peices and or peices I have no idea where the hell they go.

3	:-P Overall, the set is quite fun I must admit.

3	Full price, I probably would not go for it, But I got it for just under 70 dollars.

3	For that price I can confidently say its quite worth it, many useful peices, nice figures (other than the aliens) and the tube things are quite fun to boot, even though I liked the life on mars system more, which I also have.

3	None the less, its very fun to make them shoot around.

3	Alright, so its not much of a command base either, and it looks abit bare.

3	But it's still fun, even if you ignore the nerf section.

3	Overall I give it a hardy 3.5 out of 5, the openness and epic fail of a missile launcher are hard to get by, but overall, its a dandy set :-D Merry Christmas *wub*

1	Thanks for the review Brickmaster!

1	I wanted this set at first but I realized I don't want it as much anymore, seems like a waste of 90$.

1	:-(

2	I just want the ship...Just the ship.

2	I don't recall mine having an alignment problem on the tubes... could you perhaps take a closer picture of the area?

2	Did yours also have two of the same sticker for the wings of the alien craft?

3	Thanks for this review.

3	Lots of minifigs is a plus, although half of them are junk jellies, but dang the base just doesn't seem impressive.

3	It looks so cheap, like a skeleton.

3	The tubes are just ridiculous.

3	But hey, at least it comes with two cool spacecraft, that's nice.

2	I agree, it does seem very scarce, but Ive taken apart the nerf launcher, made a new module with the tube the launcher used, and beefed up the base with some computers and other things.

2	For 90 dollars I would pass, I agree.

2	On sale it is lovely, though.

2	And none the less ive been entertained for ages with them flyin through the tubes :-D

2	Thanks for the review Brickmaster!

2	This set looks nice, I really like the orange (*wub*) and white colour scheme, although the purple of the LoM base was very cool too.

2	I only have the LoM base, if you have it built could you show a comparison?

2	On an unrelated note, by the time I realised the red and blue hangers on the LoM base were for the red and blue mechs, the mechs were no longer in stores.

2	:'-( I was a bit slow, huh?

2	:-P Anywho, this is one set I won't be buying, although if the rocket was sold separately I'd get that.

2	:-D Thanks again.

2	*y* ~Peace

3	Should be here's the completed base and my Knee In Cordoroys (sp?)

3	Great review.

3	Thanks for the photos and review Brickmaster.

3	I'm hoping to find this on sale as well... no luck so far.

3	I love the white ship, and I think the base would be amusing, but ultimately hard to re-use.

3	Incidentally, that long axel is common in recent technic sets, but I think it was orignally made for the hockey sets.

3	:-D

3	Set 7741.

3	The box: Back: Cool pose on back: The insides: The DSS: Theres acually a printed piece: The new handcuff piece with SB in the back: The finished product: The inventory: Police page: The mail page: Is this a new air plane?

3	: The fireman page: The back: A future doctor hair piece?

3	: Price: 5/5 Play: 5/5 Overall: 5/5 I *wub* it!!!!

3	!

2	Lol, "Polizei" is GERMAN for police.

3	I quite like it, but I feel that my lego city is getting over-run with helicopters and planes.

3	Also I have got the helicopter from the 7237 police station set, but it is not as good as this Plus I'am sooooo dissapointed that the :-X stickers :-X are blue instead of black and green as they will not fit with the sets I have already got :-D Nice review thanks Edited by Caseyref, 26 December 2007 - 02:04 AM.

3	Thanks for the review PSPguy.

3	I think this is a very nice little chopper... but the biggest reason why I will probably get this is for the handcuffs!

2	thanks in advance!

2	Nice Review *y* i will get 2 of these at the least especialy since they're going to be $15 AUD *wub* :'-)

2	A nice simple Helicopter!

2	I always had thoughts of this, but after the review I'm gonna go get it!

3	PSPguy, on Dec 27 2007, 03:08 AM, said: What?

3	Errr.... no.

3	As Brikbitz said on his site in the 7732 postal plane review... Quote You can see the traditional airplane window piece, but the bad news is they've changed the window pane.

3	It's the new flat piece used in 4996 Beach House, it just doesn't work as well.

3	Without the original bevelled edge it doesn't seal the window and there is small noticable gap around the edge.

3	Not a major problem but it might get a bit draughty inside and certainly no high altitude flying.

3	I was wondering if it is the old or new type.

3	(The look recessed to me.

3	:-/ ) They're definitely recessed new windows in this set I'm afraid, just in case no-one has answered your question yet.

3	I got this set in Woolworths the other day.

3	Tescos have it too now.

3	I have to say it's my all time favourite Police helicopter.

3	Nice review PSP guy!

3	So here it is, the long expected ;-) review of the town plan: I bought it at the Legostore Riem Arcaden last Saturday.

3	I paid 149,99 EUR for 1981 pieces.

3	This set is separated in 4 parts.

3	1: the Service/Gasstation 2: the cars.

3	the petrol pump and the fountain 3: the cinema 4: the town hall The Service Station has a lot of really nice details, like tools for the car repair, or the table with the cashpoint and the foodstation (there?s a croissant, a banana and a apple in this set).

3	One of my favourit parts is the trolley with some tools, you can see it at brickshelf.

3	At the second part are only a few pieces and i needed not much time to built the 2 cars, the fountain and the petrol pump.

3	There?s something at the truck i don?t understand.. maybe i did something wrong.. but.. the truck has no backlights.. *wacko* I like the petrol pump, that?s why i post a pic of it: The cinema is the highlight for me.

3	It has also really nice details, like the popcorn table or the gumball or candy machine.

3	The colours sheme is really nice, the front of the building with the big displays is a cool idea.

3	Overall a really nice building.

3	The town hall has also a really nice colour sheme, i love that dark green mixed with the white stairs.

3	A lot of plants around and in the town hall.

3	As you can see some figs who married there.

3	Not more to say about this building.

3	See the pics and enjoy it: Overall this set is a must have!!

3	It was really fun to built it.

3	This set reminds me of the Back to the Future movie with Michael J.

3	Fox.

3	The whole gallery is at Brickshelf, there you can find a few more pics.

3	I hope you enjoyed this review.

3	Regards Sandra

3	Great review Sandra, thanks for taking the time.

3	I love the theatre and the town hall, and the married couple is just a cute little extra *wub* This looks fantastic not only for the model, but for parts as well!

3	Thank you for the great review Sandra *y* .

3	I *wub* the detail that TLC added to this set.

3	I would like to add that I think all the buildings look *sweet* .

3	I really like how you compared the look to "Back to the Future".

3	When I saw the first pics, I thought the same thing.

3	The look of the set is definitly the 1950's.

3	I am :-( to see the price though.

3	I am sure this set will be $149.99 US too.

3	GREAT REVIEW, Model On!

3	!

3	Thank you for the review Sandra!

3	This set looks finally nice, better than my first view.

3	I really need it, I've already planed to integrate it to my new layout...

3	It will be hard to wait for it!

3	Thank you very much for the wonderful review, Legocastlegirl!

3	Plenty of pics, thanks again!

3	*wub* *y* ~Peace

3	Axle, on Dec 28 2007, 02:07 PM, said: Can you take a picture(s) of all the film posters?

3	There?s no necessity to take pics of all the film posters.

3	There are only 3 different film posters at the set.

3	Always one poster twice.. and you can see every different poster at the brickshelf gallery.

3	If you need more details, then you should maybe buy it :-) Regards Sandra

3	Awesome!!

3	I love the intierior of the Theater!

3	Really good reveiw!

3	I enjoyed seeing this review.

3	Nice to get some different angles on the components.

3	Sorry to disagree with anyone however, but this was not a great review.

3	I appreciate the effort Sandra made but a great review would include more details such as what are stickers and what are printed pieces.

3	A great review points out flaws or limitations as well as what works or is really neat.

3	A great review would have analyzed the price per piece and compared that to other sets/themes.

3	One might look at the recent reviews of the Indy sets or the new Spongebob sets as examples of really good reviews.

3	The pictures are good but a great review, above all, should provide the reader with some new information, perhaps even answer questions posed in the pre-release discussion thread.

3	I learned nothing new about the set from this review.

3	That said, it was a good review for someone who had not seen the pre-release discussion and she did a good job of showing said person what they could expect in the set.

3	I see the service station has a full arry of tools, oxy/fuel torch and other goodies.

3	not a bad set, still very pricey :-/

3	Thank you for the review

3	Very good review, thanks!!!!!!!!

3	This set is a true thing of beauty ;-) I love the vehicles and all the sweet details added to render that gklorious 50's atmosphere ;-) I love thge Town Hall, its very cleverly built and looks great 8-?

3	My favoprite part of the whole bunch has to be the movie theater wich is superb *wub* I guess its pocorn time :-P PS: @ tedbeard - do tone it down youg man !!

3	If you're not happy with Sandra's work, do provide one yourself instead of bitching on how YOU view a review and on how Sandra's post is veryt far from one (according to you !!)

3	*yoda*

3	Thanks for the review Legocastlegirl - excellent work *y*!

3	I agree with you, the best part seems to be the movietheater!!

3	That?s perfect because I just love to watch movies in the theater, so far this year I?ve seen 46 pictures (and had some pop-corn to ;-)).

3	This is a must-get-set!!

3	Town On copmike

3	Really cool review: I have got so much to do that I even did not know that set is already available.

3	It was my third review i made and i have to say that i made this review not for analyses, just only to show the EB Members some nice pics and to tell them my opinion.

3	Lego is fun for me!!

3	I don?t like to analyse the pieces, bricks, prices, colours.

3	I just want to build something.

3	That?s why i?m at Eurobricks and not at an other big legocommunity in Germany.

3	Lego is fun, fun, fun!!

3	And everybody knows that lego is a expensive hobbie.. so why should i write it again and again?

3	Oh...

3	I want this sooooooo bad!!

3	!

3	Nice review - thx for all the pics.

3	They certainly made me consider getting this set.

3	KimT BTW: which set would You recommend: Market Streeet, Town Plan or Cafe Corner?

3	Just curious.

3	They're pretty expensive and I might only afford one of them.

3	I guess it all depends on what you are after Kim.

3	If you want a really great and detailed set I would opt for the Cafe Corner, but if you want a set that can easilly be included in a city I would opt for Town Plan.

3	Since I can't afford all of them, I will just get Town Plan, because I lve the feeling of thge set and that theater is superb !!

3	*yoda*

3	They're pretty expensive and I might only afford one of them.

3	Definitely the Coffee corner.

3	It?s a hard desicion between Coffee Corner and Town Plan, because they are both really great sets.

3	The Market Street is no "must have" in my opinion.

3	But the other two.

3	Maybe you should start with the Coffee Corner, it?s the older set.

3	The Town Plan is newer and will be available longer then the Coffee Corner.

3	I hope it helped you a litte bit :-$ Regards Sandra Edited by Legocastlegirl, 04 January 2008 - 10:43 AM.

3	This is a great set, lots of detail and that service station and gaspumps do it for me!

3	Wow, I have not been called a "youg man" (by which I assume you mean "young") for a while.

3	As a forty year old with three kids that's unusual.

3	*sweet* I tried very hard to remain positive in my critique and complimented her on those things she had done well.

3	I felt that given the somewhat juvenile "OMG, BEST...REVIEW...EVER" tone that was creeping in amongst the replys, that it needed to be tempered with some thoughtful suggestions as to how a good review could be made great.

3	Your ad hominem approach is offensive and far more negative than I was and to suggest I should do my own review is ridiculous.

3	I live in Canada and we do not even have the set available here yet thus I am interested in seeing reviews of this set.

3	If I already had the set I would not be so interested.

3	And next time you propose to critique a critique perhaps you should actually read what I wrote.

3	I said she wrote a good review for a specific audience.

3	I did NOT say it was awful or whatever you seem to have assumed I meant.

3	Saying something is good but could be improved can hardly be characterized as "bitching".

3	:-|

3	Thanks for the review.

3	I really want this set because: 1.

3	It looks fantastic 2.

3	Has harder to find colors 3.

3	Is a 50th anniversary commemorative 4.

3	Some of the models are based on the 50s sets (i love the old stuff) The tanker truck is a perfect recreation of the old HO 1:87 scale Esso Tanker Truck.

3	I have one, and you can look at it for comparison if you would like.

3	Lego HO vehicles I'd like to modify the truck from this new set to look even more like the old Esso truck, getting rid of the green and adding some decals.

3	Happy New Year, everyone!

3	I went to my local Wal-mart looking for an exclusive Bionicle set yesterday, but was amazed to find everything there- SW, Bionicle, EF, Indie, the works.

3	I nabbed the JSF and the Rogue Shadow and scampered home to take pics with my new camera.

3	*wub* The box: The same as the other '07 boxes.

3	Nothing new.

3	The back shows the various features, with "pop out R2."

3	:-| Luckily, the intruction booklet and the DSS were intact- not folded like the last MM set I got.

3	|-/ The DSS: Not too bad, but printed parts would have been great.

3	The figs.

3	Anakin is amazing, IMO.

3	*wub* Fits the CW Anie great.

3	I noticed on the S@H reviews the kiddies were saying how ugly he looked.

3	|-/ They need to see the CW cartoon.

3	For the sake of my health, I should probably stop reading those.

3	:-D The build.

3	I won't go too in-depth on the build, since *vader* posted a very in-depth review here.

3	The start of the build: The body of the fighter starts out long and skinny.

3	The JSF's landing gear allows it to sit comfortably without getting in the way while swooshing.

3	R2-D2's launching device.

3	R2 in position.

3	When launched...

3	...He often gets stuck if you don't press the button hard enough.

3	:-/ Looks like R2 needs to lay off... whatever it is robots eat.

3	So far: The flag stickered.

3	It's a big sucker sticker.

3	Completed.

3	I forgot to add the nose stickers before I took the pic.

3	Warning- the nose cone sticker is actually two stickers.

3	I thought it was one, peeled of one of the stickers, and put it on the middle of the two 1x8 plates, and didn't notice the other sticker.

3	*wacko* Various completed shots: I think this was a beautiful little set.

3	R2's launching unit and the flick missiles are annoying, but easily fixed.

3	I plan to add proper cannons in place of the flick missiles.

3	Anakin is a great minifig, but he doesn't look so well standing next to my other figs.

3	Tks Will for your great review !!

3	G after reading *vader* 's reviews (of that set and the RS) and yours I really can't wait to get that set and all of the SW sets :-P Really nice photography there which is sweet !!

3	*yoda*

3	Thanks Will!

3	This really is a nice set!

3	Your new camera and the backround looks great, the pic quality is very good!

3	Thanks!!

3	*y*

3	Thanks for the review, Mr. Mandalorian!

3	This set looks very nice, and it's good to know the nose cone stickers are 2 separate ones, so they don't cross bricks.

3	:-D That camera is working out great for ya'!

3	Thanks again!

3	~Peace

3	Thanks for the reveiw on this great set!

3	I actually just came home from TRU with this, maybe 1/2 hour ago!

3	Funny!

3	Love the new hair sculpt!

3	*wub*

3	Great Review!!

3	I still don't like that Cartoon Anakin though :-/ Excuse me for a sec *Runs to local Wal-mart to check" :-D Buying 08 Sets On!

3	P

3	this is a brilliant review of a brilliant set!

3	*sweet* thanks a lot!

3	i know this may be a bit much to ask but could take some pics of the whole instruction booklet?

3	please!!!

3	if you can thanks a bunch.

3	but if not do know of a place where i could find the instructions?

3	Thanks, guys!

3	:-/ If you check *vader* 's review, he has a lot of pics of the build, that might work just as well.

3	Will

3	ok i thought it might be to much to ask.

3	i will try *vader* 's review.

3	and again thanks for the review *y*

3	Than kyou for the review.

3	I don't know if I buy this set now I know there's also a Anakin in the AT-TE with a new jedi, but who knows.

3	Wow, I'm surprised no one had done this already.

3	First off, this is a truly lovely set that many people should own, even though it's SOLD OUT on the S@H :'-( .

3	now lets start off with an overview.

3	*Note*: I was missing a few of the pieces (the rabbit, the trike) when I toke the pics.

3	The figs and a cat.

3	The engine: I really love this thing.

3	It's a beautiful 0-6-0 steam engine with a tender.

3	This is probably the most detailed steam engine Lego has given us.

3	I loved it so much, I made a non-holiday version for my town.

3	The flat cars: I like these, but they seem a bit simple.

3	Their cargo is good for Christmas or a birthday party.

3	The passenger car: It resembles the green passenger car we got a while back, but I like the interior in this one a bit better.

3	The caboose: a simple caboose like the one from 2001. the sad thing about it is thats there is no interior and it's hard to take the roof off.

3	Overall: I like this set, but it is kind of hard to use during the non winter months.

3	The price is kind of good, but with that price, it should have came with the motor.

3	I give it a 9/10 Happy New Year!

3	Thanks!

3	*sweet* *y*

3	Thanks for the review AgentRick57.

3	It is a beautiful set, and quite cheap for me; $50 AUD for 965 parts!

3	8-?

3	Not sure what I will do with the rabbit though; it is huge!

3	:-D (I was considering doing this review myself but Sinnerton is a mess... :-/ )

2	NO I need it!

2	I lost my rabbit in the great void known as the large old brown box of doom(L.O.B.B.O.D for short)!!!!!

2	Exobuilder, on Jan 4 2008, 10:46 AM, said: I will gladly have your rabbit!

2	*wub* X-D Nah...

2	I'll probably use it as a were-rabbit.

2	these jokes are killing me X-D

3	Thanks for the good review, I wish I had bought one when it was going for only ?24.99 on LSAH instead of the usual price of ?50!

3	I got that set from my grandma on x-mas.

3	She ordered it early.

3	I really like the presesnts and that blue thing.

3	3 wheeler?

3	Here in america, It's 100$$.

3	Ouch.

3	I like the rabbit.

3	Whats with the rats in the trees and the cargo train?

3	Nice review.

3	Edited by ~VBBN~, 04 January 2008 - 01:31 PM.

3	Dang it, I meant to try to get one of these after Christmas ...

3	I knew they were half-off at S@H and I just forgot.

3	Now they're sold out.

3	Darn!

3	Thanks for the review!

3	this is a nice set X-O i managed to get 6 of em' before thay sold out :-$

2	Blah.

2	I wanted one of these at half off but I forgot and missed out.

2	Thanks for the review though :-$

3	I was fortunate enough to get one along with the Hobby Train.

3	They are the first trains I have ever owned (mainly by virtue of them having been half price).

3	It's a fantastic selection of parts with the Holiday Train, as well as it really looking the part as a set.

3	I'm happy not to get a motor; as I think the 9V setup would prove expensive, and the IR control system for the RC setup seems a bit poor.

3	I got some "dead" track for with it to have just as a push train for now.

3	Got one for 90 USD, one of the best trains ever..Funny as train, perfect for parts.

3	What else to say.

3	*y*

3	Okie guys and gals, here s time for some droid exploration with my review of set 7670.

3	As a general statement I have to say its really a neat set that is not that expensive for what it holds.

3	1) Box art Like always I will start with pics of the box art.

3	BTW, notice anything guys ?

3	No bloody crappy DSS.

3	Yes, finally a set without stickers and that feels great :-D 2) The Mfs Nothing really spectacular there.

3	The only novelty lies within the inclusion of the new Commander (yellow torso) BD.

3	Apart from that, there are 2 BDs and unfortunately yet another SBD (I like those but I have a huge amount of them, and I would rather had something different).

3	You have 3 short blasters and a couple of extra parts.

3	3) The Spider Droid I think it?s a pretty cool little buggar.

3	It?s a rather simple yet classic construction I think.

3	It has sweet parts such as the BD body in dark bley.

3	It really has a spider feel unlike the previous Ep3 one.

3	4) The Hailfire Droid This baby represents the ?pi?ce de resistance?

3	of this set.

3	I truly love it !!

3	Sure it?s a bit under scale but I don?t really mind that.

3	Its conception is superb even if I totally dislike assembling those technic treads (especially 80 of those small things).

3	The ellipse of the treads is well balanced and that trans disc is a brilliant idea.

3	The great thing is those new flick fire missiles: they don?t fall unlike the other ones and they do look good on this baby.

3	Also you can put the wheels together and the missiles to gain some shelf space (easy storage ON :-D ) In conclusion those druids re really sweet and are perfect target practice for the upcoming RGS hehe !!

3	I hope you enjoyed that review and do not hesitate to comment and ask pic requests if any ;-) *yoda*

3	Hey, Thanks for the review!

3	I think I will definately get this set!

3	It comes with 2x 79 thread pieces... *wacko* ;-) Thanks for the review, I'll definitively get this set (maybe monday :'-) ), love those droids *wub*

2	Painful memories X-D I think they are great looking but what a pain to assemble !!

2	Especially the tiny ones.

2	At lzaest the Bat Tank had the larger ones ;-) *yoda*

3	I totally like this set *wub*!

3	I bought it some days ago ,it looks really nice together with the MTT.

2	a druid battle pack would also be a nice idea for the castle sets.

2	Thank for the nice review with many pictures.

2	May I ask what you paid for this?

2	My first (and second) idea was that 25 euro was a bit to much for this.

2	:-)

2	They released the battle droid commander in 2000 :-|

2	Trudop561, on Jan 5 2008, 04:21 PM, said: They released the battle droid commander in 2000 :-| While there was a yellow-marked battle droid officer in the 3343 minifigure pack released in 2000, the battle droid commander from 7670 is different.

2	The new 7670 commander has a torso made of all yellow plastic, whereas the 2000 battle droid commander had a tan torso with yellow printings, and a tan head with yellow printings.

2	So, while we have had a BD commander before, the 7670 commander is "new."

2	My first (and second) idea was that 25 euro was a bit to much for this.

2	:-) X-D whatever :-P Bloody typo I say.

2	However, the upcomming Castle Advent calendar might include druids :-P I paid 30?

2	for it ;-) (dang 1 cent more expensive as S@H :-D ) Trudop561, on Jan 5 2008, 11:21 PM, said: They released the battle droid commander in 2000 :-| Yes, another nice tone, meessa so happy !!

2	First, you are very welcome for my review of a set present in your wishlist.

2	Then the Commander you are talking about has a tan body with oreange markings only (check !!)

2	and the commander here has a full YELLOW body like in the Spiderman set Doc Oc's hideout (4856) !!

2	Therefore those 2 Commanders are 2 different MFs.

2	*yoda*

3	Yeah finally *yoda* got his SW :-D I got 2 of them after X mas - they are really cool - especially the Spider Droid!

3	2 of them On!

3	& Happy *yoda* On :-P Edited by aayla-secura, 05 January 2008 - 10:38 PM.

2	You thought the Bat Tank was bad, The Tie Crawler has 81 for each of the sides *sing*.

2	and don't get me started on the Sand Crawler!

2	:-X

2	Nice Review!

2	And you finally got an 08 set!

2	I haven't gotten any, I blame Wal-mart for putting products out late |-/ :-D Instead of a SBD, TLC should have included a Droideka(New Version) *y* The scale is a bit off, so this is a Dwarf Hailfire droid :-P P

2	thanks for the reveiw, i've got one of these and an AT-AP in the mail hopefully arriveing tomorrow :-) Edited by legoman, 06 January 2008 - 12:15 AM.

2	Nive Review of it Yoda..

2	But i was going to do a review of it..

2	But now i see this..

2	I don't want to do it anymore.. :'-( Next time..

2	Try to do it with action.. [It is rare that people do that, they only do it with the set and not further..] ;-)

1	Nice review, thanks.

1	It still seems overpriced to me though.

1	Also, the box shows the droid torsos that are used for "feet" on the Spider Droid as being light bley, yet they are clearly dark bley.

1	*wacko* TK

2	Great review mate as usual, for me the highlight of this set has to be the new spider droid.

2	Even though it's made up of some strange parts it really appeals to me, i would love a few of those babys.

2	The Hellfire droid is also well put together even if it is a little small, but hey it looks fun.

2	I really like the look of this set but the price tag really puts me off, why oh why did lego price it so high.... :'-(

2	great review very precise.

2	as for the spider droid construction, i have already worked it into a moc: http://www.brickshel...ry.cgi?f=290980 stryker-single gun hydra-seven guns hammer-missile pods.

2	steel...

3	Thanks for the great reveiw *yoda* Fantastic pictures (Very crisp) I am now going onto bricklink to purchse to because you have reasured me that this is a good set.

3	Ashoka~

3	Great review, as we've come to expect from *yoda* *y* Nice to see that TLG is finding new and interesting ways to get around the "no minifig only" sets restrictions with Hasbro.

3	Clearly, this is another army builder with a minimal vehicle as we're becoming accustomed to.

3	Heck, even the diminutive Hailfire is technically a droid as well, thus making this all minifigs, from a certain point of view.

3	Only negative: It is a bit overpriced.

3	I'll have a better feel for that when I get one.

3	Treads/links always drive up a price, so it might just be fair.

3	The spiderdroid is a winner, even with the unusual parts assortment.

3	I like it when LEGO thinks of different ways to use things, I think it promotes the same from us.

3	I'm not sure what I think of the new battledroid commanders, but at least I can make extras easily if I need to, as I bought a bunch of yellow droid bodies off Bricklink once, thinking I might want to make some kind of new droid out of them.

3	They were cheap at the time, now I expect the price to go up just because of this potential use.

3	Between those and the grey ones, it's good to see more becoming available.

3	Hopefully we'll see black and a few other colours produced for some nice customizing possibilities.

3	All in all, a nice little set with a great army building potential, especially on a buy-one-get-one-half-off or better type of sale.

3	Until then, I'll grab one or two and be glad to have them.

3	I got this set for a few months [1 or 2].. And i agree that it is small..

3	But still..

3	It looks great on plates, clone troopers [Just for fun..] >:-)

1	i got this and a couple of other sets on monday.and to tell you the truth, i was a bit dissapointed.i like the set, i like the parts, but it's definitly not worth it's RRP of $45 NZD, if you ask me i should be more like $35 NZD, but hey, i still like it, i got it for $30 on ebay so i'm not complaining *y* *y*

2	my hailfire droid is gonna be coming in the mail soon, as well as the battlepacks.

3	Ah I finally got the 2 City sets I really wanted !!

3	I am so happy that Lego went postal on us :-P .

3	Since they are rather small I shall do a mix review of these 2 sweet sweet sets.

3	1) Mail Van (7731) Like always I?ll start with shots of the box art and bloody DSS.

3	Now here are the extras of that set: I really love the new torso of the postal worker.

3	My huge grip lies on the mail box: that mail logo is a freaking sticker !!

3	For that part I was so expecting a printed part.

3	That is really really bad !!

3	Apart from that the design is pretty cool.

3	The van is quite simple but I think its pretty cute.

3	I love the fact that the rear is a window.

3	2) Air Mail (7732) Like always I?ll start with shots of the box art and bloody DSS.

3	The extras are OK: another great postal worker.

3	You also have yet another red trolley with a package that is a bloody sticker yet again !!

3	G TLC should have more printed parts !!

3	That plane for me is a classic thing of beauty !!

3	Really is consistent with the fantastic planes of the 80?s.

3	That?s the kind of lanes TLC should produce instead of those huge Playmo planes.

3	Actually I am happy that TLC released that one ?

3	for once its not a bloody airline exclusive promo set !!

3	Here are general pics.

3	I love the engines of the plane: simple yet superb.

3	Also the top hatch opens to insert mail and packages.

3	The front control panel is a printed part !!

3	I love the classic double train windows and here is a poc of the undeneath of the set.

3	In conclusion I truly love these small sets: they are the perfect size (4 wide car yeay !!)

3	and the colour pattern is amazing as well.

3	I hope you enjoyed that review and do not hesitate to comment and ask pic requests if any ;-) *yoda*

3	Great review Yoda.

3	Thanks for sharing.

3	I wasn't real fond of the postal truck at first.

3	It's so different than those in the US.

3	But after seeing your close-up images (esp.

3	the back of the tuck), it looks really neat.

3	I also like the mail box a lot.

3	It looks good in red.

3	Too bad for the stickers, but it's still nice.

3	The plane reminds me a lot of the design used in the Jurassic Park set.

3	As you've said, it's similar to 80s designs.

3	I really like the brick-built design too.

3	It's just real Lego - that's about all I can say.

3	Very nice sets that are a must together.

3	Thanks for the review.

3	Excellent review.

3	You convinced me to buy these two.

3	Could you tell me how much you payed for them?

3	I think I'm gonna buy them tomorrow if they have it already (or if I don't see any cooler sets).

3	I haven't spotted these in the US yet.

3	I'm looking forward to finding them.

3	Overall, the 2008 line-up is a excellent and it's going to be difficult for me to decide which themes/sets to pursue.

3	There's a lot to choose from.

3	Thanks for the great review *yoda* .

3	I'm definitely going to get that plane, I've sadly only owned one of the many Lego planes there is.

3	Where do you live?

3	Nice review yoda I dont think I have ever read one with as much cursing of stickers!

3	:-D I love these two little sets, the colour scheme the little different wheels on the post van and of course the new postmen uniforms!

3	Would have been nice if they had included little satchels like in the new indiana jones sets, oh well!

3	;-) postman Yoda on!

3	*yoda*

3	Thanks for the takes on these two sets, Yoda.

3	Stickers or not, I still think these are charming sets with all the essence and nostalgia of the older sets back in the 80/90's.

3	Am I the first one to notice the new doors used in the back of the van.

3	Not only is it using the popular new frame, but the old container doors have been redesigned to fit with the new frame as well.

3	Pity they're not yellow, though.

3	Very nice, cheers Yoda!

3	I'll definitely be getting the post van, not sure about the plane though.

3	Both are awesome, but I think I have enough planes... Can you tell me though, the wheels on the van, are they rubber or plastic?

3	They look a bit tacky...

3	these little sets are really nice!

3	they cought my eye the minute i saw them!

3	it would have been SO great if there was a post office to go with them!

3	there are so few buildings in lego city the design is very classic and i am ofcourse considering to get them but it seems that i have a lot of small cars and planes on my desk!

3	:-$ recently i took a flight with Cyprus Airways from Thessaloniki to Cyprus and the two promo plane sets were there!

3	I was so tired though that i couldnt stay awake to buy them!

3	im taking a flight again on Tuesday and i hope they are not out of stock!!

3	thanks for a great review Yoda!

3	a fine job as always!

3	cant wait for your next one

3	Aww man, is TLC really getting too cheap for printed parts?

3	Shame on you TLC!!

3	Despite those stickers these are two really neat sets.

3	Especially the airplane.

3	Classic *wub* Reminds me of that little plane my dad bought in an airplane.

3	Not sure what's the set nr..

3	The window at the rear of the van looks like a normal window frame without the clips for the shutters.

3	I never knew those existed 8-?

3	Might come handy for ship building.

3	Thanks for the review Yoda!

3	Thank you for the nice review Pity of the stickers but the design is nice 80ies on!

3	Great Review *yoda* (I find myself saying that line alot :-D ) I love these two little sets *wub* TLC continues the Great City Line that started in 07 and continues into 08 Its also nice to have other sub lines besides Fire and police :-| :-P I hope there are many more Postal Sets, like a Post office!

3	!That would be sweet!

3	Hope these are Mainstream and not those damn exclusives >:-( Postal ON!

3	P

2	Thanks for the review!

2	I was always going to get these two sets, so you haven't swayed me at all!!

2	X-D I reckon Lego could enhance this sub-theme by releasing a post motorbike (with or without a sidecar) and post office.

2	Obviouly the office would be the hub of all the activity, while the post bike would take care of the postal run.

2	This would free up the van to take or recieve bulk mail or parcels to or from the airport.

2	It could then also do the parcel deliveries around the city.

2	The office would also serve as the reciever for all the parcels the new goods truck might deliver.

2	Just some thoughts, that's all!!

2	*sweet*

2	Also a small town feel post office would be so cool: like a 20/30?

2	set ;-) We can be sure of one thing though, this year's advent calendar will have a postamn and small post office ;-) Post On !!

2	*yoda*

3	Thanks for the review :-) I was actually considering getting these, but I saw they were overpriced for my tastes - too bad, theyre nifty lil things *wub*

3	loool : Spielberg goes on a career change :-D these are some nice sets.

3	I really love that car.

3	looks sleek

3	Thanks for a nice review and few comments to sets: Nice airplane, finally some reminiscence for Lego City Golden Era (for me years 1982-1992).

3	Everything is nice, but two things are freezing a smile on my face.

3	First of all the ugly new hinge used for plane roof.

3	I have already 4032 and those new hinges are looking really terrible when compared f.e.

3	with 6368.

3	Second one is new minifig, I don?t know what I expected, but this torso design looks too simple and too cheap..

3	Concerning new car - I appreciate fact, that TLC makes after long long years again Postal sets, but I don?t like those new-style cars.

3	Matchbox wheels and bad rate between drivers cockpit and cargo space are damping me from buying.

3	6651 Mail Truck or 105 Canada Post Truck were much better... Edited by Kanal-K1, 06 January 2008 - 07:33 PM.

2	While the plane does look nice, I don't particularly care for the van.

2	But the van does have some good parts, which is the only reason I would by one: yellow mud guards, the new windshield, and the small door on the rear.

1	Well first off, thanks yoda for the great review.

1	:-) Hmmm... Well, i have to say, i'm not at all impressed with any of these sets.

1	I mean, there nice and all, but the van just seems way to small.

1	It would have been nice if you could fit more than one package in it.

1	I guessi'm one of those that are more of the fan of the 6 wide trucks.

1	And the plane.... Hm.

1	this has a "cute" factor and all, but i mean com'on... You have to open a hatch on the roof to get your packages in??

1	And what about getting them out?

1	You have to flip the plane upside down?

1	:-| Weak.

1	They should have had a hinged rear end or a hatch on the side.

3	Yes, this is the LEGO charming!

3	No stairs in buildings, cars with just one minifig, all those things that make LEGO what it is...

3	Thanks Yoda for your review!

3	Those posts sets will be mine, but I will wait to find them in my supermarket, even if I have to wait 2 or 3 months, I know that I will save some money, so I will buy more LEGO :-D There are simple designed sets, but we don't need more: two nice litle sets that are not oversized and too expensive.

2	TheBrickster, on Jan 5 2008, 10:12 AM, said: I wasn't real fond of the postal truck at first.

2	It's so different than those in the US.

2	good point B... this design is just too foreign to my eyes for me to enjoy... i don't like either of these sets, very disapointing - the postal theme has so much potential.

2	i don't really like the torsos either - too plain/cheap as kanal suggested.

2	and i will agree that the wheels on the van look cheap.

2	i was sooooo impressed with city 2007, this is a real let down.

2	though, i am happy to see a small set with a postal box.

2	so, even though, all that aside, i'll probably buy 6 of the van - just for the yellow mudgards, postal box and stickers to populate my city.

2	and i think this set will provide some excellent piece to MOC a yellow civillian convertable with *sweet* - BM

2	I'm glad to see the mail van has the doors that used to be on the older cargo containers.

2	I had given up on those older ones, but now that they're still out there, I may invest in the older cargo system instead of the new 6-wide ones.

2	Both sets are good enough, I'll get both.

2	I'm hoping for a postal building too, even though I have the smaller of the old post offices.

2	A nice big modern one would be great.

2	I'm not too hung up about the design of the plane; I've got the neat old cargo plane with the tail that swings open (one of the best plane sets) for big packages.

2	The truck is goofy looking, but if I get sick of looking at it I can rebuild it into a classic looking one.

2	Great review by the way, the pictures are some of the better one I've seen in a review recently.

3	I guessi'm one of those that are more of the fan of the 6 wide trucks.

3	I see your point that more cargo capacity would have been better.

3	Nevertheless, my personal preference is for smaller "classic" scale City sets.

3	The mail van is nice and small, and should fit well with my road plates and 1990s cars from the 4561 train.

3	On a side note, did anyone notice the message on the back of both sets' boxes, "designed for easy building and instant play"?

3	It surprised me a little, since these sets seem no less complex than any other City set of late.

3	They look like quick builds, sure, but not as though the designers went out of their way to simplify them.

2	Thanks *yoda* for the great reviews.

2	I love the airplane, it's really cute.

2	The van needed to grow on me though but you did the trick.

2	I don't like the wheels of the van.

2	They will need replacing.

2	And wouldn't everything have been better if they were completely red?

2	Dr.

2	Brick

3	Thanks for the great reviews, *yoda*!

3	The car looks great.

3	Hey everyone, my first 2008 set is this one, 5613.

3	I thought I'd share a review of it.

3	*sweet* I'd like to say sorry about my photos, they were taken quickly.

3	first, we have the box: it is the smallest lego box I've ever seen, and actually looks cute *wub* it will be heavy competition with playmobil's specials... back of the box, showing an action pose: the contents of the little box, with a very tiny instruction manual *wub* the manual unfolded.

3	Notice that every part has its part number beside it :-) the back of the manual, showing some fire sets and the other Impulse sets the parts, 30 in total: the small set built.

3	the firefighter has a small fire to extinquish, armed with an axe, chainsaw, other saw and foam... psssh thing X-D .

3	five extra parts in a 30 part set!

3	we get an extra black hatchet, yellow bar tap, light bley 1*1 plate, red 1*1 plate modified with fingers and 2*2 dark bley radar dish.

3	Besides the plate, I've never seen these as reserve parts... but I'm not complaining X-D here is a small "alternate" model I created with it: a small bbq... what?

3	He's hungry and he needs to put something on the bbq >:-) X-D Overall, you can't go wrong with these Impulse sets.

3	I paid 2.89 euros for this little set, so thats a great value!

3	Sadly the only impulse avaible were these 3 city sets (no police) and the alien Mars mission...

3	Looking forward to the knight and magician as well as those Indy sets!

3	TT

3	Cool!

3	Finally its an entire line I can actually afford to own every set!

3	:-D I can't wait to get my hands on them!

3	If its possible, could you give us the demensions of the box?

3	It would be apprectiated.

3	This is a nice little set, with 2 axes (*wub* >:-)) and some nice parts.

3	Cool alternate model too!

3	Beach House Reviewed by Dunamis Set 4996 522 Pieces $29.95 from Target Build time 90 minutes Yet another interesting Creator theme house.

3	This one comes fresh of the 2008 line of sets and promises 3 different models.

3	Packing 522 pieces (albeit a lot of 1x1 plates) for only $29.95 it was hard to pass this one by as I was foraging for the new 2008 Star Wars sets at the local Target.

3	Plus, I was itching to do another review since I had finally fully recovered from my marathon UCS Falcon review which took the better part a month to complete.

3	The Box: The box is pretty standard Creator type box which shows off the three models (beach house, Caf?

3	and ?towering?

3	apartment building.)

3	The back of the box shows some of the features of the three models.

3	Interesting features of the three models prominently displayed on the back include: - Food counter complete with coffee (espresso) maker and food warmer (with chicken leg!)

3	- Home office complete with laptop (and the ubiquitous coffee cup.)

3	- Flip up roof granting access inside of beach house.

3	Note the satellite TV dish and even rain gutters along the roofline!

3	Opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals.

3	We?re back to the reusable cereal box type tab system that we saw so often in 2007 sets.

3	Note the parts inventory is on the side of the box as well.

3	This is a nice feature.

3	Once inside the box, we are greeted by eight sealed bags plus two yellow 16x2 plates and a green 32x16 baseplate.

3	Thank goodness there is no DSS (dreaded sticker sheet) but alas there are no minifigs.

3	In addition, there are the three manuals (one for each model) and they were stuffed into my box with the care of kid trying to put 10 gallons (or liters if you prefer) of candy in a 5 gallon bucket.

3	But hey, we?re not collecting manuals here so who cares if the manuals are all bent and warped?

3	The Manuals: The three manuals are 74, 72 and 48 pages in length.

3	They are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings: - Piece call outs for each step - Parts inventory at the end of the primary model build - Page numbers Color separation in these manuals were fine for me.

3	Plus, we get the usual verbose LEGO instructions on not dumping all your pieces outside in the grass and not to dump all your pieces into a single pile.

3	Thanks for the tip, TLG!

3	Parts list The Pieces: Pretty standard stuff here and as I mentioned, lots of 1x1 plates and tiles (at least 100.)

3	However, we do get quite a few windows and a couple of doors.

3	A majority of the color is black and yellow.

3	I did see a few pieces that I was not familiar with so I?m going to show them below.

3	Keep in mind I?m not a parts jockey so bear with me if I think a part is brand new for 2008 and it was actually released with the classic space line.

3	2x2 Window (fixed) and 4x3 window that opens: The follow photo shows the window glass (same as in Corner Caf?

3	), door glass and new black parts.

3	Turns out these black parts are used as wheels.

3	I showed the window glass because it still contains the molding circle just like they did before.

3	It is hard to see from the photo, but it is there.

3	The door glass I think might be new: I don?t recall seeing these 2x2 round plates with clips before and I thought I would show the mail only because it is printed and not a sticker: I know these are common, but didn?t they have four studs on top?

3	These only have two: How about this sloped 4x3 window that opens: Overall a nice assortment of parts with nothing juniorized.

3	The Build: The build was fun and was fairly straightforward.

3	Once you figure out which of the three models to build, it goes pretty quick.

3	Here are a few shots: See how the inside is made: Look at the detail with the flowers and even the outside water faucet!

3	Outdoor seating area: Upstairs being built: Upstairs with opening roof (notice the satellite TV dish): Check out the patio on the upstairs complete with outdoor light and rain gutters!

3	Here?s my favorite, the BBQ grill.

3	At least we know where those new parts go: Finally, check out the tree.

3	No juniorization here!

3	Here is what is left over: So far, I have only built the primary model.

3	The others look interesting, especially the caf?.

3	The Design: The design was well done.

3	Very rich in detail.

3	I love how there are no juniorized parts.

3	The house is accessible by taking off the top floor (like Caf?

3	Corner and Market Street).

3	There is an internal staircase as well.

3	There is no interior to speak of in the beach house, but there is in the other two models.

3	The only real negative is that it is kind of small when you get it done.

3	It would be nice if it was about 50% bigger.

3	Here are a few views of the beach house with a few minifigs thrown in: Check out the close-up of the caf?

3	which I think looks great: Also, here is a photo of the interior of the apartment building where you can see the office and computer: Overall Thoughts: It is a really nice set.

3	A tad on the small side but it has some great detail and lots of features.

3	Quick enough to build all three models and would fit real nice into an existing town plan.

3	Is minifig scale, but does not come with any.

3	Lots of window parts and black slopes.

3	Is a nice diversion from the onslaught of Clone Wars ships that we can?t remember seeing from the movies.

3	Final Rating: 84% Build 9/10 (Pretty quick and fun.)

3	Functionality 9/10 (It is a Creator set so you have multiple varied builds.

3	Diverse enough to keep the kids entertained.)

3	Design 10/10 (Excellent and well thought out.

3	Outstanding detail for such a small model.)

3	Parts 6/10 (Fair, nothing earth-shattering but lots of slopes and windows.)

3	Price 8/10 (Price ratio is good but you get a lot of little parts.

3	Would be better with minifigs.)

3	Nice set and review.

3	What I really like is that this set gives You a lot of ideas for Your own houses (MOCs)?

3	KimT

3	Thanks for that really nice review Dunamis!

3	Now it is even more harder for me to wait for this set.

3	I hope my Legostore will get it tomorrow!!

3	It is really nice.

3	I?m a really big fan of the creator houses.. but that one is now the best one for me!!!

3	I love the colour of it and of course the windows at the roof.

3	*wub* Creator House ON!!!

3	Greetings Sandra

3	Love this set now more than ever.

3	*wub* I knew I wanted it from the first leaked boxshots, especially with my love of yellow buildings (just ask Hinckley ;-) ).

3	Great review, especially nice to see the closeup parts shots.

3	Those new 2x2 white windows are very much like replacements for the classic 2x2 windows TLG stopped regularly making a while back, so it's great to see them.

3	The wheels are trolley wheels, common in sets including stretchers and handcarts.

3	The holder for them is a fairly recent part I think.

3	I remember a couple coming in a little single minifig jet engine repair set I picked up in a S@H order within the last year.

3	Oh honey, be sure to wrench that chicken before it burns!

3	*wacko* Thanks for another excellent review of a set I'm even more excited about than before!

3	*y*

3	Thanks for the review!

3	I definitely plan on getting this one.

3	Thanks again!

3	*sweet*

3	Thank you for the nice review with many pictures.

3	*y* :-D I already wanted this set, but the pictures make it I want even much/more.

2	I didn't know that the other models in this set came with interiors.

2	This changes everything!

2	AgentRick57, on Jan 7 2008, 09:49 PM, said: I didn't know that the other models in this set came with interiors.

2	Keep in mind there is not a lot of interior, just mainly what was shown in the last two photos of the review.

2	Still, it does make the models really nice.

3	Great review, thank you.

3	I have this on order for my youngest's birthday next month as our first venture into Creator.

3	Looking towards the Town House thereafter, and then perhaps Town Plan or the Town House.

3	Another great review from Dunamis Thanks!

3	I will get it if I can find it on sale!

3	!

3	Thanks for the review.

3	I'll buy this.

3	Thank you for the great review.

3	I think, I?ll get 2 of these sets, so I can have the Beach House and the Caf?

3	Don?t worry, I?m not complaining.

3	It just came to my mind, because today I rebuild my 7866 (from 1983), which had 2 of these babys.

3	Thanks for this great review!

3	Thanks for the great review!

3	Very in depth!

2	Hey, Yesterday I got around to MOD my beachhouse too!

2	I bought two boxes so I could have enough material for an extra floor and then I also added a kitchen, a vine in the backyard, storage for the upper floor...

Edited by Darth_Legois_619, 23 March 2008 - 11:00 PM.

3	Thanks for the review Dunamis, this is a great little set!

3	I'm also very impressed with Takuto20's mods.

3	I've been trying a few of my own.

3	I liked the tower block design, but a lot of stuff needed fixing.

3	Firstly I added a 4th wall, and made it so the storeys could be lifted off like in the other models.

3	I also added flowers on the windowsills and doorways out on to the balconies.

3	Still to be added is an extra door for the top floor which I'm going to get from the new doors and windows pack.

3	I added a chimney that goes all the way up the back of the house, and has a fireplace on every level.

3	Each floor is fully furnished with a fireplace, wash basin and bed on the upper levels... ...and a corner sofa and coffee table, plus an extra large fireplace on the ground floor.

3	Finally here is my idea of what to do with two copies of this set!

3	All the parts pictured are from 2x 4996, except 5 extra fence panels and the minifigs.

3	The house on the left has it's garden at the rear.

1	1.

1	BEFORE BUYING Even if I am City fan, those new sized planes are really not mine cup of tea, my love to Lego is firmly frozen somewhere between years 1980-1995.

1	Main reason to buy was, that I wanted to write a review at Czech Afol web Kostky.org.

1	I bought it three days ago via web advertising, price was +- 35 USD.

1	2.

1	AFTER OPENING THE BOX As presumed, some very big parts and three bags, and as an additional bonus lot of Danish air free of charge.

1	First sight told me, that this will be really short and easy building.. 3.

1	IMPRESSIONS DURING BUILDING ...and it was really true.

1	30 minutes of lazy building.

1	Bag 1 - plane.

1	Bag 2 - plane gondols with supports.

1	Bag 3 - wings and propellers.

1	When I saw the way, how is this plane made, I was strongly thinking to play Money for Nothing from Dire Straits as a music accordant with whole set.

1	4.

1	IMPRESSIONS AFTER BUILDING - LOOKOUT Juniorized creeps.

1	This is my first plane in this scale and for 99% the last one.

1	Lack of details, lot of ugly big parts, from whole set you can see the main development target - to keep RRP at some certain low level.

1	Inner space of airplane absolutely undone, no details, no luggage, no computers, nothing at all!!

1	Just a lot, lot of air!

1	The very only details in whole plane are the stickered pilots desk and some kind of seat constuction.

1	5.

1	IMPRESSIONS AFTER BUILDING - PLAYABILITY But, what is playability at this set?

1	Hydroplane, which cannot float (as seen on enclosed photos) ?

1	If TLC will make some new kind of big parts used for gondolas, to make the plane floating, they will for sure make no other damage.

1	Juniorization couldn?t be higher.

1	You even cannot drive across the carpet with the plane.

1	So, how to play?

1	Open the doors, open the cabin part, and turn with propellers?

1	Weak, Weak, Weak!

1	6.

1	RESUMED IMPRESSIONS Sadly I must say, that at limited release sets TLC?

1	boat seems to sailing to the worst part of the coast.

1	After quite good 7344, perfect 7899 and 7900, strange, but acceptable 7998, juniorization came back with 7906, followed with this ugly Playmobilized 7732.

1	7.

1	FINAL WORD In fact, even 15 USD seems to be too much for this kind of set.

1	35 USD, expected RRP in our country, is really overpriced to hell.

1	Neither set, nor minifig is not interesting.

1	TLC maybe knows about juniorization as well, as nowhere on the box the number of pieces isn?t written.

1	If you my AFOL friends want to spent your bucks, better give half of the price to African orphans.

1	You will save your money, and you will have a good feeling!

1	All the photos you can see below, as I cannot upload onto this topic due to some limit.. http://www.kostky.or...c=15954.new#new Edited by Kanal-K1, 16 January 2008 - 10:32 PM.

1	Ah great review Kanal-K1 (and welcome to EB!

1	:-D ), I was waiting for one of this set.

1	Not that I was expecting anything good, I won't buy it.

1	I agree with thr playability, it does seem weak.

1	What can you do with it.

1	Swoosh it?

1	:-/ Big step backwards LEGO... :-( Dr.

1	Brick

1	I think this is one to leave on the shelf with the giant dump truck of 2006 and the hovercraft of 2007!

1	A big thumbs down for me.

1	This doesn't look like Lego at all :-| *n* *n* *n* *n* *n* out of *n* *n* *n* *n* *n*

1	Howly cow!

1	This is *y* *y* *y* for you for making a review so fast!

1	Review gets *y* *y* , ugly plane gets :-X.

1	Thanks for the review!

1	Thanks for the review, but Its an utter pass for me on this one - I already have a huge juniorized plane from the airport set - one is enough for me!

1	:-$

1	I have the big passenger plane so I'll be passing on this one.

1	One big juniorised plane is enough for me!

1	If I didn't have the passenger plane though I'd rather get the Cargo plane.

1	There's enough Police in my city as it is!

2	Am I the only that one that thinks it is not SO BAD??????????????????????

2	?What I am trying to say is wouldn't planes be this big in real life??

2	?I know it has a lot of big pieces but how would they make them any smaller,or how would they the big pieces into a bunch of tiny pieces?well any way I do think in some cases that if there is any "juniorized" involved it should be with duplo.

2	complaning OFF

1	Thanks for the review!

1	*sweet* I am stunned at the lack of an interior... not that it makes much difference as I wasn't likely to want this set anyway as I own the passenger plane from last year.

1	Sorry to steal your image, but I just had to post this!

1	:-P

2	Thks for this caustic review :-D I'll wait for the parts on bricklink.

2	I think you're a bit unfair with this small oversized submarine - oups sorry, I mean plane.

2	Here are some advantages I tried to imagine : 1. that's the first submarine with a plane nose, 2.

2	That's the first unprinted nose, 3.

2	That's the first shark that make me laugh, and which has a plain white fin 4.

2	And at last, you should have notice that that the first submarine with a wing made of several plates It is said that this set has more than 200 parts...

2	Hide and seek !

2	X-D You may have lost several bags I'm eager that people buy this set a lot : I'd like to buy a lot of these new white 4x4x2 curved slope for my MOCs.

2	Can you take a picture of the plane crashing in the sink ?

2	Is it fire proof ?

2	I think that will be too easy this year to decide what is the crap of year ...

1	Just pull the plug out of your bathtub.

1	But wait... it won't fit through the drain because it's too big :-( Come on, they could have at least put one tiny little seat inside that horrible fuselage!

1	:-X :-X

1	Thanks for the review, unfortunately the pictures did not load for me!

1	I have to say having seen other images, I do agree with your comments, the plane is far to big, and not enough details.

1	That sums it up for me!

1	:-D :-D :-D Concerning last sentence - I have seen or built hundreds of different sets issued since 1980 until now, but this plane is really a hot candidate not only for Crap of the year, but for Crap of the decade... Last two days I thought about the sense of this set, and, finally, I was enlighted - I must call to my folks living in a small village, I am pretty sure, that they will be happy for a new house for their pullets.

1	Edited by Kanal-K1, 17 January 2008 - 06:31 PM.

1	i have to agree with almost all of the replies here that This set is the most ugliest looking Lego Set I have ever seen.

1	If I have never seen this set, and ppl showed it to me, I would have thought it would be some little kid's MOC or something (no offence!)

1	Huge juniorized pieces, bad color theme (i would say it would look better if the wing is white), no interior and huge DSS!

1	I will avoid this set like the plague.

1	I own the entire CITY line (except for the airport) and planning to get all the CITY stuff that Lego releases.

1	But, this set will ruin my plans coz I will avoid it... unless someone gives it to me for free.

1	haha *wacko* Boo LEGO BOO!

1	:-X

1	Brick Miner, on Jan 18 2008, 05:01 AM, said: :-D - great picture Agreed!

1	:-D :-D Wonderful review, now I'll never even consider getting this set (not that I did before... X-D).

1	Thanks for your insight!

1	~Peace

1	I'll probably get the nice green Cargo plane.

1	But not this.

1	How can the same hull pieces be used for full size jets and what's supposed to be a small seaplane.

2	What I don't understand is what sort of crime this seaplane is exactly designed to fight that the multitude of other crimefighters in Lego City can't handle.

1	This still looks like a cool set but the price not so much.

1	Do all lego police set come with the polizei option or just ones from europe i have not bought a police set in years.

3	LEGOMAN132, on Sep 11 2008, 06:26 PM, said: This still looks like a cool set but the price not so much.

3	The price is now €20 in Ireland on S@H, which is reasonable considering the large fuselage pieces.

3	Has anyone modded this set to make a reasonable looking plane?

3	I am thinking of buy it to do so, but I don't want to take a risk and end up with lots of useless pieces.

3	Aswell as -€20.

3	Hello and welcome to another Redman set review!

3	Well, actually, the first Redman set review!

3	I'm your host, Redman, and today I adorn my medieval outfit to tell you about the Impulse set simply titled "The Knight".

3	This is a great set, with 14 pieces, 2 of which are spare, and a minifig with 2 weapons, 2 helmets, and some shiny armour.

3	All this is packaged in a tiny box, just short of 10 cm?

3	(or 3?

3	inches?

3	), with a neat little instruction manual that folds up to the size of the weapons rack included in the set.

3	As you can see, this set only costs a measly 7 NZD.

3	(Disclaimer: Redman not included.)

3	Here we see the box, clearly showing what the box holds.

3	On the top we see a 1:1 scale picture of a minifig, for those new to Lego, or who have forgotten how big a minifig is I guess.

3	:-/ X-D The instruction manual, showing the nice and easy built, with me for size comparison.

3	:-D (*Sorry about the dark image, I had to lean over the light to get a birds eye pic.

3	;-)*) Here we see the 2 different soldiers you can make with the set; a knight, and a guard or standard troop or soldier or whatever you want to call him... (Note, each set comes with only 1 minifigure, and additional accessories.)

3	Of course you know I'm in the picture just for the sake of it, I'm not really one of the soldiers.

3	X-D The neat little weapons rack, or rather equipment rack, as it holds not only a weapon but a shield (except the ovoid ones), helmet, and armour.

3	Nice and easy storage, so your equipment won't get dirty lying around on the ground.

3	:-D One of the spare parts is another of those robot hands, so you can stick that in place of the shield and allow the rack to hold 2 weapons.

3	Just thought you'd like to know that.

3	:-$ And here we see the nifty little structure of the thing.

3	It can even support a whole minifig!

3	Note the grey stud on the bottom bar is a spare part, I just find it better used there to hold the armour.

3	:-) Huh?

3	I don't remember this picture... 8-| It appears I drifted off, and these guys don't look too happy I overtook their weapons equipment rack.

3	:-$ I should go... X-D So, in conclusion this is a great set for army building, at a reasonable price, with nice equipment, and it can be picked up as a little extra with your normal shopping.

3	X-D That's all for today folks!

3	*sweet* [/Redman] So, what do you think?

3	Should I continue with these Redman Reviews ?

3	(:-P), or just stop now?

3	X-D Comments and criticism welcome!

3	:-$ ~Peace

3	An excellent first time (?)

3	review iamded!

3	*y* Well, atleast a first time Redman review anyway.

3	I really enjoy Redman, I hope to see him pop up more often.

3	Your pics are great now that you ditched the phone :-P , and you've shown the set from many different angles and perspectives.

3	Thanks for this brilliant review, you have certainly convinced me to get a few of these, and then some X-D Redman ON!

3	EDIT: BTW, is it just me, or does my new avatar make me seem a bit creepy?

3	8-| Batbrick is Back!

3	Anyway, great review, I think I will get 5 of these X-D Batbrick Away!

3	>:-)

2	very good reviews, i think that redman is really ok, a very little cute curious fig... sadly he is not in the impulse set... ;-) I wish to see redman still around about your creepy avatar, yes, it look a bit creepy *skull* nausicaakro (this impulse set is storage in 8 copies, with 8 wizard set, 16 city set (2x), 16 mission to mars set... so if you want buy 10 of this (like me) you must find 2 different toy center)

3	You should continue with these Redman Reviews There great!!

3	!

3	Nice review, very detailed.

3	*y* As for the spare parts, mine didn't come with any.

3	Both dark grey 1x1 round plates are used on the weapons rack (one for the armour, one for the helmet) and I only got one robot hand for holding weapons.

3	Thanks everyone for your positive feedback, it's really appreciated!

3	:-D You'd be surprised how long that 'Redman Presents' thing up the top took me to make!

3	X-D So, it appears people do like Redman, expect him to be reviewing The Good Wizard and Battle Arachnoid in near future!

3	(I know those have already been reviewed, but New Zealand never gets sets first, so I'll just be reviewing the sets I get.

3	I like Redman, he'd make a good superhero.

3	Good review!

3	Edit: 200 posts!

3	Edited by AgentRick57, 19 January 2008 - 05:58 AM.

3	Thanks, AgentRick!

3	Actually Redman's based on the wrestling costume version of Spider-man, as seen in this set.

3	*sweet* ~Peace

1	I would have purchased a few of these except for the fact that I do not like the new torso that they use.

3	Well today i finally got my hands on set 7038, now since the moment i first saw pics of this set i knew it was for me.

3	So lets start with the new troll helmet and torso, these are both great.

3	This troll really stands out as a leader when next to the usual trolls in the dwarf mining set: Ok so here's a few shots of the front of the set: Now one thing i really like about this set is the way that lego have placed the back wheels higher than the front.

3	This allows the set to really appear to being pulled: Here we have a shot at the missiles on the wagon, these are better than some around i have to say.

3	If you look just behind the bottom missile you will see a simple firing device, simply push it down and then let it go to see those missiles fire: The troll flag is moved behind the missiles for firing: One thing that does bother me about this set is the lack of anything on the rear, ok it's easy to fix with a little moc'ing so it's not the end of the world but i would of liked something placed there: Now lets move on to the Crownie's wagon, this is simple yet good for holding weapons: As for the Crown knights themselves, well there the ones from the impulse sets which is great IMO: Here's a few quick shots of the 2 larger trolls we have so far, i prefer the sand green one.

3	What about you?

3	Well that's the end for now, requests for pics and comments are welcome.

3	Overall i rate this set as a must for anyone who's a fantasy castle fan, i know i'll be getting more of this set...... As for the new wagon well it's joined up with the other trolls: I do hope the impules crownies i bought today can handle them, oh and yes i did change the knights heads X-D : Fantasy war on!!

3	*vader*

3	Awesome review!!

3	I like the turkey leg hanging in front of the troll X-D Yea the back looks a little....Empty 8-| Well Overall I enjoyed the review!

3	See ya soon!

2	seems like a good set should i get it?

2	BTW how did you get you hands on this?

2	BTW how did you get you hands on this?

2	Well if you like the Fantasy line then yes, if not no.

2	I had to get this set through Shop @ Home, took ages to get here i'm sorry to say.

3	Looks like an ace set :-$ I may get this just for the sand green troll, even if I'm not a great castle fan, I do want one of them things!

3	*wub* I also love the goblin's new metal flaked helmet, and the same style with the wheels.

3	They look very nice.

3	The chicken leg fishing pole is always fun too :-$

3	Nice review.

3	*sweet* This is a must buy for me since I *wub* the new sand green giant troll!

3	Now I just have to wait until it's available in the US :'-( General Tarful

3	Thanks for this excellent review Vader!

3	It seems you are succumbing to the Castle side of the force.

3	I love the new helmet, and the new Orc torso is fantastic as well, which is great to see that the Troll Faction has many ranks too.

3	The Troll himself I love, I agree with you in saying I prefer the sand green version.

3	The battle wagon is cool, one of the better wagon designs, and the flag is a great touch which improves it.

3	Sadly the back is rather empty, but a few mods'll change that :-) And of course this set includes the infamous chicken pole!

3	One pic request, if you have time Vader, could you please post a few pics of the new helmet on its own, and on a human soldier please?

3	Batbrick is Back!

3	>:-)

3	Thanks for the review *vader*!

3	The first picture of the troll is great, the gold armour really shines!

3	X-D A fantastic set, I'll definitely get a couple of these!

3	*wub* As for the Ogres/'giant trolls', the dark tan one fits in the mine setting well, but for above ground, settings, I prefer the sand green one.

3	*y* ~Peace Edited by iamded, 19 January 2008 - 10:21 AM.

3	Thanks again.

2	>:-) Yeah it's alot better than the other one, i'll have to buy some extra ones now just to replace the old ones |-/ Still let's hope the new impulse set has the new version *y*

3	This is fantastic, I love the new helmets for the goblins *sweet* I've always loved the chicken leg thing, really screams LEGO to me!

3	At least how LEGO used to be :'-( Great little bit The goblins are awesome too, and the sand green one should look good next to the tan ones...gives a nice feeling of a real species.

3	In reality not all members of a species are identical, it's great seeing them in different colors.

3	Great review X-D

3	Those extra helmet pictures just seal how much I love those new helmets *wub* They look so great.

3	Thank you for the review, vader!

3	That set looks worth buying!

3	8-?

3	i think you gave me a good reason to buy it... ;-)

1	Great review, Vader :-) As I've said before, this is a nice set, but doesn't really come with anything that doesn't come with the other sets of the line.

1	For this reason, it will be somewhere at the bottom of my list for 2008.

1	Also, I like torso and helmet of the Dwarf Mining orcs much better.

1	The colours make the torso look rather dull and boring, while the other, more brown one, looks much clearer and more exciting.

1	I think I like the *knight* helmet better too, looks more covering and threatening than this one, although I'll save my judgement until I have one in my hands.

1	Thanks again Vader ;-) EDIT: Forgot to mention, hilarious pic in your sig, Vader :-D Edited by TinyPiesRUs, 19 January 2008 - 08:28 AM.

2	That's strange.

2	I saw about 20 of them in my TRU.

3	Hello all Eurobricks members and Town Lovers, This is my first classic town review.

3	For today, I will be featuring the 6641, 4-Wheelin' Truck which is produced in 1987.

3	For some younger members in EB, you might not have encounter such a baby roaming down the streets, horning at others with its big massive truck.

3	Considering this is a 1987 set, such a vehicle size is considered big in those days.

3	Name: 4-Wheelin' Truck Theme: LEGO System / Town Year: 1987 Pieces: 80 Minifigs: 1 Price: USD$6.50 An image of a 6641, 4-Wheelin' Truck *Hello Everyone* Why the name 4-Wheelin' Truck?

3	It is because this truck is equipped with 4 heavy duty wheels which is considered "big" among other small vehicles in Classic Town.

3	Please take note, most of the vehicles that are produced in Classic Town era, are 4-studs wide.

3	This truck is no exception.

3	Meet the driver and his truck!

3	This truck has a very good combinations of different colors that are common for most town vehicles.

3	It made used of blue, white and red as its primary combinations.

3	I find that this combinations is quite soothing to its eyes especially the blue bricks.

3	In addition, the mini-fig torso is superb.

3	The driver must be a great fan of this vehicle.

3	I realised most truck drivers in the classic town era wear this most of the time.

3	I wonder if its some kind of an organization?

3	Front view There is 2 red doors coupled with the truck, to enable the driver to get in properly.

3	This vehicle is considered big in the 1980s.

3	However, if you compared it with the current city vehicles, this truck certainly will not outsize the current designs.

3	Please take note of the wheels.

3	The wheels are pretty different.

3	I don't remember seeing these wheels in many other vehicles, maybe some members can help me on this.

3	Most of the classic town vehicles have a window frame on top which is known as a "sun-roof".

3	In this set, this feature is also included.

3	Furthermore, the vehicle frame has a simple mechanism which all town lovers love.

3	It is to lift it up and place their driver in and out the seat.

3	Most importantly, you do not have to take off the entire window frame just to put in the driver.

3	Different angles of the 4-Wheelin' Truck SNOT Technique?

3	Back 20 years ago, LEGO had been experimenting with SNOT technique.

3	You can see that the back looks very neat without the studs.

3	In addition, it can be quite useful to place a mini-fig on top of it, or throw some baggage for some quick getaway.

3	Summary review Playability: 8/10 (Great addition to your Town collection.)

3	Design: 8.5/10 (Very good design.

3	I love 4-studs truck.

3	At least, it is able to occupy one side of the lane) Price: 9/10 (An inexpensive set based on the 1987 pricing) Overall: 8.5/10 (A must have for all Classic Town lovers, we have been complaining for more wider range of vehicle) I gave it a "4" based on my Review Score Card.

3	What about yours?

3	Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine.

3	Pictures can be found in My Brickshelf (When moderated) Edited by WhiteFang, 13 July 2008 - 12:08 PM.

1	great review!

3	great review of a lovely set!

3	thank you!

3	sadly I don't see my 6641 really often, because it is kind of in the back of my shelf.

3	But I might get it and swoosh it (?)

3	a few times...!

3	IMHO i think 6675 is a little bit more aggressive.

3	cool!

3	Please make more!

2	Glad you guys liked this review.

2	I don't remember seeing these wheels in many other vehicles, maybe some members can help me on this.

2	First of all, another great review!

2	Thanks for doing these!

2	As for the wheels, these were primarily Technic wheels but did find their way into some other models.

2	In white, I can only find a handful of minifig sets that they are included with.

2	There's half a dozen space sets but, apart from the 4-Wheelin Truck, the only other Town set appears to be the 6524 Blizzard Blazer (tractor with snow plough).

2	The wheels were also in a Train set called 4549 Road & Rail Hauler where they were the wheels on a big forklift.

2	Cheers Rog

3	Love this set!

3	Nice review also..

3	I had the set in my hands a few times but never bought it, though I drooled at it, I remember.

3	I guess I didn't get pocket money at that time, it was not that common around europe in the 80s I guess.

3	So better to say that no one bought it for me.. A few years later I got the safari truck, which is also really sweet.

3	I like the colors of this model and the detail of it.

3	The minifig is really classic, made only for this set (appears in some later train sets as well) and shows the exact image of the truck on the shirt, including the motor piece.

3	One of the most detailed and loveliest little sets from a sweet era of Legoland city!

3	PS Voted "O" for Outstanding.

1	hmmm.... i probably would not have bought this as a kid in 1987, unless i had money to spare or the shop had no other set from space or castle, the two other big lines in 1987, and no better set in the town section.

1	i think it's a great parts pack, but the model itself does not look very attractive.

1	I never really liked those wheels, honestly.

1	They're from the basic sets, mostly, and they work pretty well in those, but i'm just not a fan... the roof, on the other hand, was very popular and the blue modified bricks at the front were quite rare in those days, but generally speaking, this was not the star of 1987. gave it a "3"

2	Thanks everyone.

2	Glad that you guys enjoyed this review.

2	rriggs, on Jul 13 2008, 08:06 PM, said: As for the wheels, these were primarily Technic wheels but did find their way into some other models.

2	In white, I can only find a handful of minifig sets that they are included with.

2	There's half a dozen space sets but, apart from the 4-Wheelin Truck, the only other Town set appears to be the 6524 Blizzard Blazer (tractor with snow plough).

2	The wheels were also in a Train set called 4549 Road & Rail Hauler where they were the wheels on a big forklift.

2	I never realised that.

2	I supposed these wheels is one of the earliest technic parts, appeared in system sets.

2	I will show it to you in a few days time, that this mini-fig torso does not only appear in this set.

2	In fact, I am quite fond of this lovely torso with its symbolic truck printed on it.

2	I wouldn't agreed less.

2	This set is a good to have and is defintely not the main highlights in 1987.

2	This is actually a great add-on to your classic town vehicle collections.

2	After seeing so many typical police cars, ambulance, fire engine and etc, I need more variety of civillan vehicles roaming down the streets.

2	I will prefer to use it to "vrooom" it around on my road baseplates.

2	only "vrooom" it around?

2	your cars can't fly?!

2	I just building my 6641 while I'm writing this and I have to say that it's really really great.

3	Dear AFOL friends, due to leakage of production plant in our country one member of our Lego club had bought a new promo set.

3	Until now he placed only photo of the box, later on promissed to make a review.

3	Heavenly God, I wanna one at all costs!

3	Most were found here... Edited by Sinner, 17 July 2008 - 12:47 AM.

3	Put photos in

3	WOW!

3	Oh set 4999, How do I love thee, let me count the ways: 1)An attractive cottage 2)A usefull service van 3)Great parts including green BURPS!

3	4)Responsible energy for my LEGO town!

3	This would be the perfect addition to my seaside village.

3	By the way, what is VESTAS?

3	OMG, I have seen the light!

3	Will it be availeble from S@H?

3	Or is it just a promo?

3	Thanks for making my day wonderfull!

3	Dr.

3	Brick

3	I want it...i want at least five!!

3	Where will it be availible?

3	O....M....

3	G!!!!!!!

3	That looks sweet!

3	How much did he say it was?

3	Wow, it does look really cool.

3	I love that...oops!

3	It's gone.

3	Can't post pics of that yet, sorry.

3	It was requested that we remove those pics.

3	Sorry everyone.

3	Have a nice day.

3	Oh my..that looks A-MA-ZING!

3	Seems my prayers for more civilian sets have been heard!

3	Hopefully we will get more such stuff in the city future1

2	I wish I had seen it.... Judging by the reactions it is a pretty good set!

2	awww i wanna see it please?

2	edit: omg its all over the interwebs, if you know where it looks amzaing its a giant windmill with a house at bottom Edited by Pencoin, 14 July 2008 - 05:24 PM.

3	I had saw the earlier image just now.

3	It looks very nice.

3	Just to share some information with you guys.

3	Vestas, an global company which is an expert in "Wind Energy" This is a tie-up with LEGO.

3	I feel its an illustration on how our world will benefit by applying and believing its technology to make use of re-useable natural resources.

3	Hinckley, is it ok for me to share a picture or two on the Vestas Exhibition that happened few months ago in Singapore?

3	Don't worry, it's not anything related "directly" to the Vestas Promo, Wind Power plant.

3	It would appear that Lego wants this beauty kept a secret...=P Anywho, this is AMAZING.

3	I found pics...somewhere...and...oh wow.

3	This thing is a must-have, and I'll be saddened so much if I can't find it anywhere.

3	I doubt they'd keep a set like this promo, though.

3	Those parts are great for town fans, castle fans, space fans...you name it, that set could be useful for it.

3	Ohhh goodness... ~Trexxen, who is blown away by this amazing set...

2	Are you working for TLG now?

2	I'm being watched you know.

2	They're outside my window...

2	So, no.

2	Not if the set appears in the pictures.

2	And if they're just of the convention, post them in community...

3	OMG!

3	OMG!

3	Wow!

3	That's simply amazing.

3	Wow!

3	I can't say more...

3	Wait, I can.

3	This is such a beatiful set.

3	I sure hope it will be available for us to, like European people.

3	It's so nice.

3	It looks like the real thing, great cottage, great pieces, great van and figures.

3	And the windthing.

3	Wow!

2	God Save the save as-function

3	Wow!

3	I searched on Brickshelf and saw pictures that is just amazing!

3	I can only imagine the cost though.

3	Will it be on S@H?

3	Or will it be sold elsewhere?

3	Cant wait!

3	-Darthperson EDIT: Heh, see those cool little chairs on the patio made of the city mudguards?

3	Edited by darthperson, 14 July 2008 - 05:58 PM.

2	Bagh I missed it all I know is that theres a cottage and van!

2	Time for Brickshelf no doubt they've been taken down to.

2	EDIT: Awsome just found the Brcikshelf pics.

2	Edited by Skipper 24, 14 July 2008 - 06:05 PM.

2	Sounds cool but I can't seem to find any of these leaked pics, not even on brickshelf.

2	Maybe I am not searching under the right phrases.

2	Oh well.

2	I guess I can wait patiently.

2	Wow!

2	Managed to find a pic on Brickshelf and this is a great set.

2	Hope it going to be released properly and not just a promo.

2	One thing though, would it not be quite noisy if you lived in that house

2	What's so great about the cottage?

2	I do agree that the generator and van are teh pwnzorz.

2	Edit by Hinckley: We prefer the use of real words here.

2	Please familiarize yourself with the Member Guidelines.

2	Thank you.

2	That sounds amazing!

2	A wind power plant as a Lego set is absolutely awesome and helps the Lego City to get environmental energy.

2	Regrettably I missed the pics.

2	When browsing through BS I didn't find them, too .

2	Can someone please post a link or sent me the link/picture via PM ?

2	Thanks.

3	I do agree that the generator and van are teh pwnzorz.

3	I think the great thing about the cottage is its very reminiscent of classic holiday home type houses that Lego used to make like this one from the late 80s which a lot of people (me included) believe Lego need to make more of.

2	I now found pics, too.

2	That's absolutely !

2	After 10188 Town Plan this is the best City set ever!

2	I really like the neat landscape with the little hill (there are a bench and some flowers on it, too ) and this brilliant cottage !

2	Great idea with that power function that the wind mill turns and then enable the lights of the cottage !

2	Concerning the City theme I must say: In the last time TLG comes up with one great surprise after the other.

2	Does anyone know where and when it'll be available (this year I think - otherwise there wouldn't be already pics, would they?)

2	and how much it'll cost (I think about 70 Euros, what do you think?)?

2	I only hope that it'll be available in Germany, too, otherwise I would be really if I am not able to get it since it is a must for every City and environment fan!

2	Klaus-Dieter Edited by Klaus-Dieter, 14 July 2008 - 06:49 PM.

2	I also found the pics, and most of what I can say is: It's kind of funny how it's a small house with a gigantic windmill over it, though.

2	OK guys, respect TLC?

2	crazy policy (They don´t take care about thiefs selling those sets long before official release,but they complain about one small photo on web ).

2	If someone still needs photo, simply email me on josefzizka@post.cz, I will be glad to send you three pictures

3	I totally agree with you, JSN' date=!

3	This house in your link reminds me of the old weekend/holiday cottages ( ).

3	Hopefully the cottage in the wind power plant set cottage includes a nice interior, too.

3	The outside looks amazing anyway !

3	I really would like to see more apartment holiday homes, too, but how it seems TLG is on its best way towards doing that!

3	Klaus-Dieter

3	I recently got a few still sealed and new sets from the 90' on ebay, and after the Rock Raider's Hover Scout this isthe second one i'll review.

3	I really like the space port theme, even if the sets may be more simple than earlier space city sets, i like the overall look and the color scheme.

3	But enough of that, let's go on with the pictures!

3	Set Nr.

3	: 6455 Name: Space Simulation Station Number of minifigs: 3 Number of pieces: 240 Release Year: 1999 First again a few pics of the boxes and the instructions: The main box: This theme had a kinda strange seperation of the pieces, the parts for the control center and the shuttle are in seperate little boxes, and the others are in polybags with the models printed on them.

3	Also seperate instructions for each step: A general overview: We got 3 lovely minifigs here, from left to right the control engineer, the mechanic and the astronaut: The -i dont know the english word for it- testing-thing, the astronaut is being tested to hard nerves there The mechanics little car, on the back an extinguisher and a radio device is attached: the take-off station for the little shuttle with the shuttle itself on it: And without it: Tools, tools, tools!

3	The shuttle as stand-alone: i think that would be fuel tanks, i like this little detail: And finally we have the controll room, would have been better with seats, but it's alright: A really sweet mid-sized set if you ask me, a few juniorized parts, but it fits perfectly with the set.

3	The theme itself is also great, and i wish that TLG brings it back, i could see stunning sets with the quality city sets have right now!

3	you just bring memory's back i never had one of the space port sets, but i know that as a little boy i visited my toy store and kept on looking to the boxes.

3	on BL those sets cost too much for what ist worth today.

3	really, TLC should bring this theme back!

3	Space port ON!

2	In the catalog images I thougt that the base was on a 16'16 baseplate...

2	I have some sets of space-port and like them, but I would want real town sets in 1999... Edited by Lord Santos, 15 July 2008 - 10:58 AM.

3	I got this set for christmas, and you gave me the feeling for wanting to build it again.

3	Thanks for the review!

3	The spinning machine is a centerfuge.

3	(Not sure of the spelling ) I remember wanting this set because my friend had the larger station with full rocket.

3	Seeing this makes me want it again.....

3	My sister got this from our grandparents once when she was interested with space but it fell into my hands later.

3	I had a lot of fun with that.

3	By the way, the name for the test thing is called a centrifuge.

3	It tests a person's ability to withstand high g-forces.

3	Edited by filefolders, 15 July 2008 - 03:55 PM.

3	*mini-bump* Wow, I'd completely forgotten about this theme, which is suprising since I absolutely loved this theme as a kid (minus the sound n' light brick, which I thought was pretty big and ugly).

3	Sure brings back memories of looking at those little catalogue booklets that came with the sets.

2	I had never seen this set or this theme before.

2	It was released during my dark age, and I had missed it.

2	It's nice to see such sets, surface once again, to educate members like me that there are some good sets we had missed during the dark age.

2	And, I must admit that this is a very good set.

2	It's comes with 3 mini-figs and Staudie with it.

2	Geez, I never thought he was an astronaunt back then.

2	The testing facility is great, and I love to see it spin, by putting Staudie in it for a "test-run".

2	The buggy is cute as well, but somehow, I don't really like the white frame at the back.

2	It looked a little odd to me.

2	The tools, are simply wonderful to have.

2	Furthermore, these are grey tools.

2	The last time, we had so many tools are the aeroplane mechanic.

2	The shuttle is nice, but does the shuttle supposed to come with a cover as well?

2	I guess, since this is a simulator, they must have cut down the budget for it.

2	The control room is good, and it will be even better with chairs included.

2	metalandi, thanks for the wonderful review!

2	Thank you very much for the review.

2	NOW I remember!

2	I got Mission Control when I was only 5 and built it with the help of my older sister.

2	I loved it so much, I never rebuilt it but now...

2	I just have to!

2	Space Simulation was one I never got but looks to be a great set.

2	WOW!!!!

2	I'm just surprised...I thought these were all street dated for the 26th of July.

2	At least that's what I read according to Lucas information.

2	Oh well, gratz on getin one of the new sets.

2	I'm looking forward to seeing the Droid Gunship and the Twilight real, real, REAL soon!

2	Do the manga guards heads fit on a regular minifig torso?

2	Stop calling them "Manga Guards", people, that sounds silly!

2	It's Magna Guards!

2	Sorry, but I just hate mangas.

1	Well TLC blew this one i was hoping the magna guards would be what they looked like in LSW 1 !!!!!

1	ohwell one more set i dont have to get.

2	Dfenz, on Jul 17 2008, 11:42 PM, said: Nice review with very clear pics!!

2	I have pre-ordered this item at a local (Belgian) store and will be getting it on July 29th, together with the 7676 Gunship.

2	Wow 59,99EUr is a LOT of money!!

2	What country do you live in???

2	Here it costed me 46EUR, so quite a price difference!!!

2	IMO the set's certainly NOT worth that much money!

2	Reki

1	UPDATE: I WILL BE MERGING REVIEWS AS THEY GO IDLE, THIS IS NOW THE DINO ATTACK REVIEW THREAD "What, Jay's not doing Viking reviews!?"

1	Nope, I think Christopher110 took care of those just fine.

1	Instead, I have brought you what is most possibly the HIGHEST-ANTICIPATED set of the year (;) :D) - the T1 Typhoon.

1	And I gotta say - Dinos apart, it's actually really cool.

1	The Dinos Let's get the worst over with.

1	Yes.

1	Those are ALL the parts in that 'dino'.

3	The Figs They're possibly the best part of the entire set, all in all.

3	Nice new head, although the glasses limit its usability.

3	I am in LOVE with the head on that fig.

3	It's perfect for any number of figures - a good 'scarred hero' face has always been on my want list.

3	I'm turning him into my Viking warlord after I post this review.

3	Again, a new head.

3	Great stubbly beard thing going on.

3	My second-favorite head of the lot.

3	Great for warriors, especially with helms.

3	The torsos are fantastic for special forces figures, if anyone's planning to do something like that.

3	Not TOO fond of the lime green on there, but it's still extremely usable.

3	This is actually a really cool machine gun.

3	I like it.

3	I think this would be a good point to note that ALL designs you see - outside the figures and dinos - are stickers.

3	That means a crapload of stickers.

3	If you can't stand stickers at all in a set, don't buy this.

3	The Copter This is one BIGASS copter.

3	The photos really don't do the size justice.

3	Lower cockpit with cool computer.

3	Too bad it's a sticker, although I'll definitely leave this one on.

3	Upper cockpit with cool computer.

3	See above.

3	Awesome gatling gun.

3	Yes, even the TECHNIC BEAMS have stickers.

3	I'm actually really fond of that little canister thing.

3	I can see using it elsewhere.

3	Yes - that's a sticker.

3	The rope and hook.

3	I forgot to mention it before, this set comes with two accessories besides the machine gun - binocs and one of those little things to slide down the rope.

3	Also, the thing that 'extends' the rope turns.

3	The other side, because they're slightly asymmetrical.

3	One of my favorite stickers.

3	The door says 'SURVIVAL EQUIPMENT'.

3	It's on both sides.

3	Definitely a keeper.

3	The base of the propeller.

3	It wobbles a bit, but doesn't fall off.

3	Very sturdy.

3	Right side of the rear propeller.

3	And the left (and better) side.

3	The tail.

3	It uses construction similar to the X-wing's nose, but on a larger scale.

3	Definitely cool.

3	A very neat part of the copter.

3	The guns are constructed so that... ... they turn without turning the cockpit.

3	The interior is rather blase, though.

3	Another of my favorite parts - landing gear.

3	This is the front section.

3	... and it retracts!

3	Unlike most ships with landing gear, this does NOT retract without effort (coughXWINGcough).

3	Very sleek.

3	The back landing gear.

3	... and again, smooth retraction.

3	Gotta love it.

3	FINAL SCORE: 8.4/10 Parts: 8/10 Figs: 10/10 Dinos: 2/10 Copter: 9/10 Value: 7/10 Don't Buy If: - you can wait for Vikings - you don't like any set with stickers - you're not a space fan Buy If: - you're a space fan - you don't mind stickers/don't apply them - you're like to create cool figures Overall, I think it was worth the price, even at 605 pieces.

3	However, I'd suggest buying Vikings even considering this.

3	Well, hope this review (unexpected as it was ;-)) helped someone out there.

3	Until next time, Bloody Jay

2	As unexpected as it was, this was very helpful!

2	;) Three questions, though: 1.

2	Is the front green rubber missle a traditional launchable missle, or does it have another firing mechanism?

2	2.

2	Concerning the guns on the side, are they fixed in one postition, or does it have any functions?

2	3.

2	Why did you decide to buy this set?

2	(Just curious!)

2	1.

2	Oh, I overlooked that, didn't I!

2	In response, it's an upside-down launcher, so the switch is on the underside.

2	So no, no special mechanism.

2	2.

2	The gatling guns can be raised, but not turned.

2	3.

2	I found it in Toys R Us, and was after a few of the figs, but after seeing the box up close and personal, decided 'what the heck!

2	It's a good break from Vikings!'

2	:-D

3	I really want those figs.....damm you Bloody Jay!!

3	!

3	Great Review Jay !!!!!

3	Tks a lot ;) I am not that of the big fan of the copter due to its proportions - but I admit its really asome looking, better as I expected :oD The best are those MFs !!!!!!

3	They are truly awsome !!!!!!!

3	I wiil but some of the smaller sets just for the figs hehe (too bad that my favorite - your second best - don't come in the smallers sets :'( ).

3	Are you going to review the other sets as well ???

3	That could be cool !!!!

3	!

3	Thanks, Bloody_Jay.

3	Another brilliant review.

3	I really like the helicopter.

3	Though I hate the stickers (it seem like there are a lot of it), it won't stop me from buying it.

3	Too bad that when will the Dino line arrive in Singapore.

3	.

3	.

3	:'( Guess I've have to wait for the meanwhile.

3	That looks like a really great set, although I don't think I'd have anywhere to put it.

3	I don't think I'll ever be able to get the set anyway, since it doesn't come out over here.

2	sam, missing your point.

2	The set _should_ come to Europe, as 7298, but without guns (large crate instead).

2	Hmmmm .

2	.

2	.

2	.

2	interesting.

2	It's a shame though, because I really like the guns.

2	Any idea when it should come to Europe?

2	EDIT: I've just scene the Official DINO Attack site, which says they're coming to Europe in October.

2	Does anyone have photos of the ones being released in Europe?

2	I'd like to compare the ones here in the U.S. to the ones in Europe...

2	No, there aren't any pictures yet.

2	Photos are not available, but basically it is: -guns +chains +ropes +crates

3	Wow, great review, for a great set.

3	Thanks Jay.

3	I really like it, although to big for my city.

3	:( I too really like the MFs.

3	Because of your review, I am definitely considering it.

3	Thanks again, LegoBmw.

3	That's interesting news about the European release.

3	I'd definitely be interested to see how they modify the set - chains, ropes, and crates are definitely useful pieces.

3	Can't wait for pictures.

3	To everyone looking for just the figures - don't skip out and get the smaller set and the tank.

3	Spend the extra $20 and get the T1.

3	It's well worth it.

3	I might pick up the Steel Sprinter and the Fire Hammer myself, still trying to decide.

3	If I do, I'll review them.

2	I guess we'll have to wait for the photos!

2	Officially announced by LEGO, the Dino Attack line is going to be made available in Europe in October 2005... EDIT: Check out the official Dino Attack site here!

3	Yeah, I picked up another one.

3	I really liked the chopper!

3	Let's cut straight to the chase.

3	Dinos: First the worst, of course.

3	These things are so horrible, they don't deserve more than one photo.

3	They're rubbery, one piece, and the only things that remotely indicate that they're made by LEGO are the holes on the bottom of their feet.

3	They're unrealistic to an extreme unmatched by even the previously reviewed Dinos, in that they are waaaaaaaay too thin, one is pink, and they're all grinning.

3	Fig: One interesting thing to note is that this one has the same torso as the iron-masked dude in the chopper, not his own bare-arms torso.

3	Pic for the sake of comparison.

3	Now, I don't consider this fig as good as the others because the other heads are useful for Vikings and assorted castle-type people, but this has sunglasses.

3	All in all, you'll probably find it useful, but I don't.

3	Still, great torso for special ops stuff.

3	Hummer: Those headlights - while stickers (yes, all prints are again stickers, although there are much less than the chopper) - are great pieces.

3	I can see using them as furnace covers or stove burners.

3	The windshield/hood area.

3	Not much to say about this one.

3	Driver's side.

3	My question?

3	When this is brought to Europe, will the steering wheel switch sides?

3	;) Seriously though, I love that little steering wheel piece more than I love taffy.

3	And I'm a man who enjoys his taffy.

3	Left side in its entirety.

3	... and the right side.

3	View through the right side - no seat here.

3	Could've done with another fig to fill the nonexistant seat, as well.

3	The... weapon.

3	Whatever it's called.

3	This uses the same mechanism as the longboat (for those that don't have either, you snap the little sports stand thing, which hits the 'missile', which fires, and since there's nothing holding the technic beam up to that height any more, it drops down so that the next missile drops into place.

3	Pretty cool, if unrealistic.).

3	The two on the side do NOT fire, I think they're mainly there for 'extra ammo'.

3	My biggest problem with this set.

3	Open bed.

3	This could have easily been remedied with a few plates.

3	Interior opened.

3	The Fire Hammer next to the T1.

3	They look very cool together, don't they?

3	You can also see my curio shelf.

3	FINAL SCORE: 7.4/10 Dinos: 1/10 Fig: 8/10 (but that's just me) Hummer: 8.5/10 Parts: 9/10 I'm a harsh reviewer.

3	I still think that if space/vehicles are your thing, you should buy this.

3	However, if you're a bigger castle fan, or just like to get all sorts of LEGO, I would still suggest buying the Viking Catapult before this.

3	However, I do think that these are some of the coolest sets of 2005.

3	This is something you will eventually want to get.

3	Until next time, Bloody Jay

2	Thanks Bloody Jay!

2	Any chance you could be reviewing the other Dino Attack sets?

2	Possibly the Steel Sprinter and Urban Avenger, but I can say with finality that I will NOT buy the tank until I find it available for $30 or less.

2	On that note, if anybody DOES find it for $30 or less, shoot me a PM.

2	;)

2	Sorry for the double post, but I just had another question in mind: How long/high/wide is this "badass" copter?

2	(including rotors).

2	I have heard of as long as 25 inches for the length, but is this true or is it just an exaggeration?

2	Have have heard of as long as 25 inches for the length, but is this true or is it just an exaggeration?

2	25" long, and the rotors are 10" long each (making it 20" wide).

2	Hope that helps!

3	Wow, i think this is the first time i'm the first to have a new set (at least here) and review it.

3	Got it 2 days ago, thanks to a fast shipping from S@H this time, and i found time now to review it now.

3	Enough of the babbling, let's let the facts and pictures speak, which actually turned out pretty well this time.

3	Set Nr.

3	: 4210 Name: Coast Guard Platform Number of minifigs: 4 Number of pieces: 469 Release Year: 2008 A few shots of the box first: 2 Books of Instructions we got here, first one for the helicopter second one for the rest and the platform itself: A general overview of the platform from above: The 4 minifigs, 3 rescue guys and one oil rig worker (?).

3	The pilot seems not very happy that he has to work in the middle of nowhere at sea Right beside the entry of the tower we have the diving equipment holder: Next, the guy can jump in this little speedboat... ...and another guy brings it down to water with the crane: If somebody is rescued from the air, he arrives here and is brought to the tower with the little moving platform than runs on "rails": Down under we got a buoy and several life belts and extinguishers: With the lift somebody who is rescued by the boat can be brought up.

3	I think it would been better if they would have made a mechanism there to bring it up, but it's okay: A few floors higher the sea is being observated and watched: On the ground level we have the medical station/warm-up room: The helicopter as stand-alone: All in all for me this is besides the police station THE city set of this year.

3	It's got great features, and looks fantastic and also has many useful pieces.

3	You can't do anything wrong with buying it, 10/10 for me!

3	That's all for now, hope you liked my review.

3	Edit: Oh damn, i forgot to write "review" in the topic title, can a mod please add this?

3	Thanks!

3	I love this set... and I wish I thought of the bridge piece idea!

3	The only part I don't like is the lift...

3	Thanks for the great review.

3	Done!

3	Thanks for the awesome review, metalandi!

3	Your pics are very clear and you go into detail about all the functions of the set.

3	I agree, this is a great set - one of the best of the CG line for sure, way better than the boat set with the tower on the Bionicle baseplate, and cheaper too.

3	I even like the helicopter better than the oversized version.

3	Lots of great parts and a really nice build by the looks of it too.

3	I can't wait for this to be released in Oz!

2	Seeing the pictures in this review certainly reinforce my original thoughts on this set: Here's an oil-rig mod waiting to happen...

3	Very nice review and nice set to boot.

3	Lots of little features that increase the playability.

3	Great pics too (i remember you had trouble before with the Tower Raid castle set, as i just got mine and was looking to review it, but saw your review in archives.....shakes fist at how slow aussies get sets ) Great Reviews On!

3	Good review ;) I will buy it this year :)

3	Excellent review Metalandi.

3	It's always great to see early pictures of new sets.

3	This set really reminds me of an oil rig, and could probably be easily modified as one (if one wanted an alternate model).

3	The two components that I like most are the boat crane and the control room, but other sections are pretty slick as well.

3	Are those printed pieces in the control room, or stickers?

3	I'm really starting to gain an appreciation for these new coast guard sets.

3	They've come a long way over the years: 575 Coast Guard Station -Released 1978.

3	I picked up the Control Boat & Tower (7739) a few weeks ago but haven't opened it yet).

3	In any case, thanks for taking the time to review this set and share it over EB.

3	Great set and great parts pack as well!

3	I guess I´m gonna buy this when it´s on sale, just for the orange parts.

3	Excellent for Exo Force
