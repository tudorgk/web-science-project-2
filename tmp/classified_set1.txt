I was immediately pleased with the price/piece which I think is pretty reasonable (343 pieces for $25). Starting with the box, great City artwork boasting "Special Edition": Tha backside of the box (no alternate models comes as no surprise): The dreaded decals (I was looking for the skull and bones for radioactive, but no such luck): My favorite part of the set, a very clever forklift: Side view: And the backside: What I like about the forklift is the bars across the top giving the vehicle a "real-life" design. The double wheels in the front with two pieces that can hold the wheels also adds to a clever design: I like the figs (although not much new - perhaps I\'ll make the driver into a werewolf later): The set includes three cargo pallets, the first some sort of fuel with gauge: The 2nd, two Indy containers, and a square 2x4 brick (I have not put the decals on yet): And the mysterious yellow cargo. Your guess is as good as mine :-$ . On to the truck, the front section: The front grill: Another angle: The back: I like the opening mechanism that is very simple, but works well. Also is the large plate tile piece inside. I like this because the entire interior has no studs: And the trailer section of the truck: Orange and yellow tail lights: And the rear trailer open: The complete set: Summary: This is a neat set that reminds me a bit of classic Lego City (but larger). It is very playable and has a lot of accessories adding to the value. The build was very simple, and enjoyable (took me about an hour). It is a great addition to a number of City sets including the Cargo Ship, Container Stacker, the World City Cargo Train, and the new Cargo Plane. As I mentioned previously, I have not yet put on the decals that I\'m sure will really add to the overall look of the set. The forklift is awesome and I like the cargo containers. The truck could have benefited from a few additional details (chrome smokers, and an undercarriage box that really opens). Considering everything, I would buy this set again.

I\'m your host, Redman, and today I adorn my medieval outfit to tell you about the Impulse set simply titled "The Knight". No wait, that\'s the old script. X-D I mean, "The Good Wizard". *sweet* The other Castle Impulse set (the first being \'The Knight\'), this is a wonderful, and in my case unexpected addition to the Castle line! I did not expect to get a nice good wizard, but rather another plain white skellie for the Impulse, and was pleasantly surprised when I saw the first picture of this set. The Impulse sets give you pieces you wouldn\'t expect to see in such small sets, for example, The Knight came with the armour, and this comes with an owl, a gem, and a crystal ball piece. It comes with 11 pieces, including the wand, owl, and gem, and no spares, which doesn\'t really matter as it doesn\'t need any. The box sports the set number, age range (which I blissfully ignore X-D), awesome Castle logo, and the assembled set, with the usual 1:1 scale picture of a minifig. The back of the box shows pictures of the boxed Skeleton Tower and King\'s Castle Siege sets. Note the price is in New Zealand dollars, and is really the same prica as any other Impulse set. Next are the instructions, which are separated into 3 parts, 1 for the minifigure, 1 for the table, and one for the bird stand. Very simple, also worth mentioning is the parts numbers are next to their respective parts, for replacement parts etc. On the back we see (on the top half) pictures of Skeleton Prison Carriage, Skeleton Tower, and King\'s Castle Siege, this time not of the boxed sets, but the sets themselves. On the lower half we have 8 pictures, each of the different Impulse sets. The Wizard\'s torso is plain sand blue, with no patterns or anything, but it doesn\'t really matter is his beard\'s in the way. ;-) The head is that same old \'white fade to grey beard\' head, but the white beard covers up most of the grey. My favourite part is the pants, I love that we\'re getting printed belts and legs again. His belt has 4 gold crosses (as seen in, if you look closely, the new Crownie\'s torso and the Crownie archer\'s torso) and a belt buckle, and the legs have a bottle, a coin, and a small bag. Nice little wizard-ey items. The, er, items, no, accessories, no, models? The stuff in the set include a little stand for the owl, and a table utilising the new 4x4 round piece in light bley, with the crystal ball in the middle, encasing the yellow gem held on by a 2x2 circle piece in blue. Why blue, I\'m not sure. Maybe it\'s because the crystal is yellow, and the Crownie\'s colours are blue and gold, so the blue piece with the yellow crystal symbolise the Crownie\'s colours. Or maybe TLC just felt the need to include an odd colour. :-P In conclusion, this is a wonderful set, with some neat accessories, and it doesn\'t really need to be bought in the masses, after all, you needs an army of owls and wizards? :-| :-P So it works fine as a single set, and adds a more fantasy feel to your Crownie army.

Here\'s the complete set in all its glory. Yes, I really like it, but then, Tabletown has the capacity to support it and my green Army have their eyes on it as a potential military transport as well. :-) I\'ll start out with the little airport ground car thingy - very neat and functional, here are views front and back: Next up, the steps which allow the plane crew to embark and disembark: And to round off this little trio, the cargo loading platform, here in its lowered position. Note the prong thingy sticking out from the rear: And here raised. The prong thingy is now hinged up to support the back of the platform and keep it level: Here\'s a slightly different angle so you can see the pieces under there: The all-important cargo itself! Hmmm...not much for a plane this size... The cargo pallet slots neatly onto the loading platform: Here\'s the complete set of ground equipment - all attached: And so onto the plane itself. Note that unlike the other large planes, the main wing sits at the TOP of the row of bricks making up the side of the fuselage: I took it apart a little so you can see the internal construction of the fuselage. Note that the cargo area is really small, right at the back. What else is this thing carrying? Illegal immigrants? :-) A picture of the rear of the fuselage, just because I like the sticker: Front landing gear. WAY better than on the other large planes. I don\'t know if this is a new piece or what but I\'ve had no problems with it at all, and my kids have been playing with it as well: The rather sexy rear undercarriage - this area reminds me of one of those giant Russian transport planes - wicked: Those angled grey slopes atop each side of the rear undercarriage annoy the heck out of me as they KEEP COMING OFF whenever I pick the plane up. I think a 1x4 plate on top to bind them together might solve that. A slightly blurry view (sorry) from underneath. The gear LOOKS like it might be capable of retracting internally, but alas, no. This is a shame as there\'s certainly enough room in there and it\'s a wasted opportunity IMO. Might have to modify that... A view of one of the four engines, I personally think they look too small and should have something under the wing as well to make them rounder: Cockpit: Crew door, open. I LOVE the smooth action of these doors and the way they seal flush against the fuselage when closed: Cargo door, open: Crew door with docked ladder: Cargo door with docked loading platform: Cargo slots inside and locks into place the same way it sits on the loader, neat: The minifigs, sorry this one is a bit blurry: And that concludes this week\'s "Show and Tell".

My own thoughts: CONs: - as noted, the cargo space is really small considering the size of the plane, although I can see this is restricted due to playability - without the barrier in the middle, the cargo would slide all over the place while the plane was being swooshed - the cargo 'lift' (I'm not sure how else to describe it) is very weak and snaps off, although it is a clever design I think it's badly implemented - there is nothing to hold the cargo pallet to the cargo lift truck so it tends to slide off all over the place as soon as the truck moves - colour issues - I had at least 3 shades of green with the larger plane pieces and noticeable variances even with identical cargo hatch pieces. At least one of them also came quite scratched, which was a little disappointing - At $79.95 AUD it's $10 more than the Passenger Plane was with less pieces and figs, and no printed pieces whatsoever! more $ for less, methinks. PROs: - Lots of nice cargo crate pieces and even the stickers for these are pretty good. - landing gear piece adjusts very well to height differentials so the plane doesn't lose its gear as often as the earlier passenger planes - the hinging mechanism works very well to open the cargo holds - opens very smoothly and is not noticeable - I'd definitely like to see more of this technique - the little vehicles work well chained together and are all good small designs OVERALL: - I really like the large planes since 06 but I don't think they've still quite hit the nail on the head. Whereas the earlier planes were a little flimsy, this one is sturdier but has its own issues. The look of the Cargo Plane is nice, and the new landing piece and cargo hatch pieces are really great, but some design weaknesses and colour issues detract from the overall product.

TLC is defiantly doing to here a gnarly complaint from me!! >:-( Ok now here we have the " real" Indy fig that is supposed to come with the set :-D I just noticed that his fedora hat goes down in the back! Bonus Picture Time, Here is a jacketless Indy with his sleeve torn off, like he looks in the Temple of doom *sweet* The next figure up is our lovely Marion *wub* *wub* *wub* Plus her head is reversible with a scared face X-D Love the new hairpiece in black!! Finally we have our undead skellie with second style head and poseable arms *The Well Of Souls The set itself is a nice model and playset! The Anubis statues are very cool and I love all the hieroglyphs on the walls 8-? Here is the SW link with Artoo and 3P0 X-D The Ark in its resting place The Ark removed, its very cool indeed, but TLC should have made the whole thing in chrome gold |-/ not metallic gold with brown and yellow!! The closeup of the Anubis statue, Yes the Eye is a sticker but at leasts a gold color! *Playability First off you can pull the pin on the Anubis statues which send them falling and taking out the walls. Behind the wall a skellie swings out! There is a lever in the back of the model where you push down and the snakes shower down upon the figs hehe With the snakes all around, Marion is both modeling with the new carrot torch and fending off viscous cobras :-D In the meantime Indy uses his whip to scale the wall and avoid all the snakes which he is afriad of. In the meantime leaving Marion behind to fight them off. :-P The whip is bendable but it will always snap back into a coil, its some type of bendy hard plastic *Scoring Figs- 9/10 Model- 8/10 Playability- 8.5/10 Overall Satisfaction- 4/10 (would be 9/10 if it wasn\'t for the stupid Anakin head error!) In the end this is a charming set and could easily fit in with the adventurers! It has the cool Anubis statues as well as the Ark.

Today us two sworn enemies will be reviewing the Creator Cargo Chopper, here is the front of the box: And while pushing iamded to his doom, here is the back: Haha! Ouch! Oh dear...here are the parts anyway... Here is the instruction of the first model, the Cargo Chopper. I love Creator sets for the different models, they always excite me. Just ignore me finishing off my nemesis in the background. Something very interesting that I liked in the instructions was this step where you must add those three 2x2 yellow rounded pieces under the chopper. This is for support while you build, which is handy, and later you take it off: And even later use it as the cargo. I found that to be rather innovative and clever, as well as - Hey! What are you hitting me for? Both instruction booklets have the same back: Now heres the Chopper itself. I love the design of it, it isn't quite minifig scale but its great all the same. This is my first non-Xpod or House creator set, and it sure is fun. Here me and iamded go for a dizzy ride. I love the nose of the copter, and the landing gear is fantastic. A shot from the other side. Oh dear, it seems we've been a bit sick from that ride, and were vomiting transgreen 1x1s. The cargo itself is nicely made, though I forgot to put on two tiles here :-$ . It fits in real well with the chopper to, and the line is great for giving iamded the wedgie he deserves: This is my first power function set, so I was pretty excited. The motor is intergrated really well into this set, and is activated by pushing that little 3x2 plate with the 1x1 slopes on it forward, until it hits the motor button, that orange knob. Another point of interest is the use of bley barrels on each side. I like this as I don't have those pieces in that colour. A shot of the motor. Its really simple, all you do is pull the hook out to any length that allows, then press the orange button and it will wind it back up. This makes the Chopper pull the cargo up into its bay, and iamded pull me here reluctantly to a whacking: A top view, is that MY head? A view of the chopper without the cargo in it. I love the lowered cockpit: The leftover pieces from building: (NOTE: iamded's head does not count as set piece) And a final shot of the set with me and iamded. Oh, it appear we're dead, oh dear... Hope you enjoyed this review, soon I will post the two alternate models. I loved this chopper, its great to play with and has nice construction. It also has some handy pieces too. The motor function sounds like a gimmick but is well intergrated into this model. Well worth the price, so far this is another win for Creator I say! So far I recommend this model, but later we'll see if the alt models are up to scratch. Also, since this is my first review, comments and criticism welcome on everything.

The set itself is a small but rather sturdy den for the pirates! Review: The minifigs consist of two pirates and one Imperial. The minifigs are not all that rare, which is disappointing, I would of liked a rarer fig! But still it is a good cheap source of pirate and Imperial figures. Here is an overall shot of the set, which includes the three figs, the shanty which is made using palm leaves pieces, and a nice grey shark nibbling at the soldier\'s oar. A close up of the soldier rowing hard in his boat. I would have preferred to have a normal soldier with shako hat, as I have more officers than normal soldiers now!: And a close up snap of the main structure. Note the wine glass, which was a nice touch! Funnily enough, only 4 pieces of treasure were included in this set, compared to the usual 8 gold coins in other sets. A view from the back, which also gives a good view of the pieces used to construct the shanty mainly simple black 1 by 1 bricks: The Shanty looks good from most angles but their are a few where the roof construction looks rather odd, but that is just a minor nitpick! Yet another view from the front,, this time at a slightly different angle. The yellow base plate looks rather nice too, I prefer it over the tan pieces we trend to get nowadays: "Attack!!" The Stupid drunk pirate in the background does not even notice! Overall I think this is a rather good set, despite some shortcomings, such as the lack of treasure and odd roof from some angles.

I picked these up the other day, but it's taken me this long to get round to posting the reviews. So, here we go: Tub comparison with a minfig (thanks Brainbox): The lighting changes a bit throughout the photographs, as it was going dark outside, so I only really had my desk light, and I kept getting in the way. 4837 Mini Trains Now the box I really like. It's no different to those of last year's sets, but the colour here is simply fantastic, and really seems appropriate for the theme. So this is what you get inside. All the pieces are still inside the bag, the optical illusion was accidental :-D . No pieces of particular outstanding interest, but the dark green cheese slopes are rather nice. Look out for those later. 1 2 3 This is the main model, and uses all the pieces in the set (bar these two, which according to the inventory are spares, but as with all my other Creator sets, I'm cheating and leaving them in). This is far and away the best model of the three, and evokes the iconic version of a steam train. The green looks superb, but I'm not sure whether that's due to the model itself or the actual colour. Moving on, we get to the second model: 1 Leftovers (yes, I admit, I was using a piece of paper) This isn't actually a bad model. I don't think it's quite as nice as the previous one, but it's not bad. It's different from the first model as well, which is good. Too muich of the same can be a bad thing. Finally, we come to the third model: Leftovers Now... I'll be honest. I don't really know what this is. It's not that good a model compared to the other two. That's all I can say, really. And of course, all the pieces fit into the tub. Overall: I have to say, I do like this set, despite the weak third model. The strength of the primary and secondary models make up for any weaknesses in the third, and I can imagine the pieces being fully usuable in building other trains. While the basic idea of these tubs isn't quite as good as the X-Pods with regards portability and general 'niceness' they aren't bad. And for a fairly cheap price (?3-4) as well. 4838 Mini Vehicles This is one of those set boxes that you see because of the ridiculously loud colours. Sound marketing scheme if you ask me. I've managed it again. There are pieces outside the bag. Or are there? Now these I like *y* . 1 2 (I don't know what the clip is for, there isn't one on the other side) 3 4 5 This is the main model of the set, and again all the pieces are used bar these three, the spares. It's quite a nice model, although the car's a bit odd. Still, I like the ramps, and the colour scheme reminds me just a little of G1 Ultra Magnus. Hmm, I think that boom arm could do with refixing... 1 2 Leftovers This is actually quite nice as well. It's that classic breakdown truck, and the boom arm itself is quite nice, with quite a bit of movement. Another solid model. 1 Leftovers I'm surprised by the amount of detail here actually. Not only have TLC included a spare wheel at the back, but also what looks like a trailer hitch, which all adds to the 'realism.' Another nice model to round out a nice set. And in the tub. Overall: I'm not sure which of the two I like better. When I bought them, and on the way home, I much preferred the train set. But after building this set, I'm not sure. This is another good set from the year when TLC seems to be giving us so many. There are some good pieces in here too, and while there's nothing unique, they're still good. So, thanks for reading, hope it helped someone, and if there are any requests, I'll see what I can do. That's requests for pics, not songs ;-) . Edited by WhiteFang, 23 May 2009 - 06:56 PM.

So i don\'t really know how to do it right, but i\'ll try the best. (Sorry if some pictures are a litte bit dark, but i\'m not really into photography and i got bad light here) Let\'s Start with the Dwarf\'s Mine Defender: Theme: Castle 2008 Set Name: Dwarf\'s Mine Defender Number: 7040 Pieces: 86 Price: ?9,99 (EUR) First, as always, the box: The back, a few instructions on how the defender works, for those how don\'t know ;-) : And the instructions: We continue with the minifigs, sorry i forgot to make a closeup of the dwarf: And finally the mine defender itself, i personally think it isn\'t as bad as maybe some people think. The chain for the catapult is great i think: I kinda love those controls, the mechanism with the rubbe rband actually works pretty well, but only on a not-glossy underground. That\'s pretty much all of it, it\'s small but i like it a lot. So let\'s go on to the tower raid now, which would be my absolute favorite of those new sets. -------------------------------------- Theme: Castle 2008 Set Name: Tower Raid Number: 7037 Pieces: 364 Price: ?29,99 (EUR) Again, first the box & Instructions: We got 2 sets of instructios here, one for the tower and one for the siege tower: The Minifigs, we got one archer and one soldier here, both with the torsos of the 2007 sets: Now thw orc side, starting with the great leader, with the new armor and the golden helmet (i love those pieces!): Closeup of the armor & helmet: Then we got another orc-knight: And the prisoner, with handcuffs! The Crownie Tower looks great overall, though there is something i don\'t really like about it, but later on that. Now the back, and that is what really bothers me, there areno walls on the first floor except the one with the wall-piece and the door, and theprison also is open at the back. The orc easily could jump out there: Not sure what these are all about, they really don\'t add much to the set: Enough rant now, let\'s go on with a pretty sweet detail, the golden crystal on the little table: The wall piece on the first floor you can ram in: And finally the very best thing of this set, the amazing orc siege tower! From the front: The great working ram, you can pull it back very far and it got pretty much power: Here we got another sweet detail, the siege "platform" that moves out by pulling a cord in the back of the tower: Finally a picture of a bit siege action: If you ram in the lower wallpiece, the brown shelfs of the prison-floor collapse and the prisoned orc is finally free! Summary: Likes: As i mentioned before, i really think that\'s the best ever produced siege tower, it\'s got so mich details and works extremely well, also the overall look of it is magnificant. The destroy-mechanism of the tower is pretty cool too, the brown door is a fine detail too. Nothing much to say about the mine defender, i like this little set, and there\'s nothing really to bother about it. Dislikes: The Back of the tower. That\'s really the only thing that\'s a bit bad imo, they could have put there 2 more walls on the first floor and something to lock the prison easily.

Still, if that really is U.S. $80, I might skip it and go for this instead, which is only $20 US. One note, though. I think there might not be a back cage on the second floor of the tower so that the mechanism can work. Did you try to see if the second floor ground still falls if you add it a fourth cage wall?

Almost exactly one year after Caf? Corner was released we get the third installment in the increasingly popular LEGO exclusive town series. Combined with the famous 10182 Caf? Corner and its trusty companion 10190 Market Street this trio makes the foundation for an amazing city block of LEGO goodness. For those new to this series of sets, check out my reviews of the two previous sets in this line: Cafe Corner Market Street I would not necessarily recommend reading too many of my reviews in one setting as you might experience loss of brain cells and/or drowsiness. You have been warned. So, how does Green Grocer stack up to the two previous sets you ask? Well, follow along kind reader and I shall attempt to unravel this question. The Box: The gigantic box is pretty standard and looks amazingly similar to the Caf? Corner box. The back of the box shows some of the features of the green grocer as well as a lot of the cool interior that was absent from the previous sets. In addition, we are shown an image of the three sets together and a small insert image showing how they connect together (as if we could not master that difficult maneuver?) Opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals. As it seems to be the norm now, we have the reusable cereal box type tab system that we saw so often in 2007 sets. However, upon opening the tabs we are pleasantly surprised to find a cardboard tray! Have not seen one of those in a while. As you can see in the photo, we have two 32x16 green base plates, three instruction manuals and a bunch of bags that are broken into four groups: Group 1 has 12 bags and goes with the first manual and builds the first floor. Group 2 has 9 bags and goes with the second manual to build the second floor. Group 3 has 14 bags and goes with the third manual for the top floor and roof. And one bag that is not numbered and hence you can open it whenever you feel like it. There are no stickers ? Yay! Moving right along, we get to the three instruction manuals. The Manuals: The three manuals are 55, 47 and 47 pages in length. They are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings: - Piece call outs for each step - Parts inventory at the end of the second manual - Page numbers Color separation in these manuals was fine for me except dark bley and black. We get a nice photo of all three sets together: Plus, we get a nice tip showing how to split up the bags and what goes where. Those additional pieces you see in the photo just below the numbered bags are the pieces that come from the single un-numbered bag (along with the base plates). Parts list Random manual shot The Pieces: Upon opening the first set of bags, one thing is clear; there are a TON of little tiny pieces! The minifigs are included in this first section as well. Interesting to note that there are a handful of printed pieces and as I mentioned previously, no stickers. We also get a host of new and exciting pieces to add to our collection. Keep in mind my scope of LEGO sets is generally centered around Star Wars, Technic, Creator and the occasional racer set so what is new to me might have been around 15 years. At any rate, here are some of the more interesting pieces: Again, note the printed tiles. This time around, LEGO has decided to include 33% more minifigs than the Caf? Corner and Market Street sets. Yes, we get four minifigs instead of three! Here are the cast of characters: Pictured (left to right) is Sir Top Hat, Miss Jenny Blue Overalls, Patti O? Furniture and little Timmy Cub Scout. I?ll leave it up to the minifig aficionados to decipher which torsos are new and to tell us all about the hairpieces. I can say with reasonable certainty that the four yellow smiley heads are not new (somebody check that?) Don?t forget the lovable little cat named ?Tom?. He is the arch-rival of the mouse ?Jerry? that lives downstairs: Overall, there are a lot of pieces, large variety and wide range of colors. The Build: If you have either of the two previous sets, you will feel right at home here. Just like in the previous builds, it seems like the first ten build steps are consumed with laying a bunch of 1x1, 1x2 and 2x2 tiles everywhere. Almost feels like 30% of the pieces are used up right away (see below). There are several sections where you build various parts of the interior. Take a look at the cash register/counter below: And the beverage cooler: And the produce stand and everything that goes in it: Looks like someone has mail: Looks like someone just had a baby: This set is incredibly well done and gives inspiration to go back and add similar items to Caf? Corner and Market Street. As before, the average builder is introduced to some new building techniques like using the hinge plates to make the angles on the front of the building as shown below: Also the top of the roof shows some interesting ideas: Overall, it is a really fun build that kept me entertained the whole way. The Design: This is a great set with lots of little details. I especially like the little mouse hole in the wall leading to the Jerry the mouse?s area. They even included a little slice of cheese! It seems the designers can?t get away from the ?usual? staircase which I always feel is way too big. Maybe future designs can incorporate a spiral staircase to save room for other things in the model. One welcome addition is the fire escape as seen below: I?m going to show a bunch of examples of various items in the set so you can get the feel of the amazing detail in this design. Take a look at the lamps (torches?) just outside the door: And the streetlight with fire hydrant: Brickwork and archway: Awning: Here is the back side of the building. Note the trashcans and yard tools: Here is a close-up of the railings on the second story balcony and the second photo is the finished product with curtains in the window. Nice use of cups to make the banister on the second floor: Here is the fireplace on the second floor: Second floor staircase with Tom?s hiding spot: Check out the radiator on the third floor: More third floor: Nice grandfather clock and rug (third floor) Check out the deck that is up on the roof. Complete with two chairs, table, umbrella, flower pots and grill: Interesting use of minifig hammers on the roof: Finally, here is what is left over when we?re done: A couple of shots of the front: A shot of the back: And here are all three together: Overall Thoughts: This is an incredible set and the best of the three in my opinion. It is hard to top Caf? Corner but I believe Green Grocer just did. I absolutely love all the details and building techniques that went into making this set. There is a ton of different parts and wide color selection. As usual, we get a bunch of tiles and small plates, but that goes with the series. Also, we get four minifigs and lots of minifig accessories. I?m giving this set a score of 100%! I thought about it and I really don?t know how they could have made it any better. In short, RUN don?t walk to go pick this set up! Final Rating: 100% Build 10/10 (Excellent - Lots of nice interiors, details and accessories to build.) Functionality 10/10 (Outstanding. Raises the bar with interior and detail. Think Caf? Corner on steroids.) Design 10/10 (Excellent ? can?t say enough good things about it.) Parts 10/10 (Great selection and diverse colors.

I linked it because the Pic wasn't resizing. http://www.brickshel...ke/dscn0017.jpg Below is the back of the box. It shows the other sets and some features of this set. Contents: Next we have the Contents. This set includes a medium sized DSS (xwingyoda), a bag labeled one, and HUGE bag labeled two, the 1 bag contains a smaller bag, and the two bag includes two smaller bags. 5 bags in all. Also pictured are the instructions. I have linked it due to the non-resize. http://www.brickshel...ke/dscn0019.jpg Figs: Included in this set are three figs. Two jellies, and 1 astro. The jeelies are fine, but I pefer the LoM ones. But they glow. Those new alien commanders for Summer look promising though. The astro is nice, and includes an extra gold Visor. MOC ON! Astro Miner: In all MM sets there is a human and alien set. The Astro par of this set is a Mini-miner. Here is a pic of construction and that wonderful space logo sticker. Not Much of a cockpit. :-/ Finished Miner(The set number, too): Overall I like the miner, and It is nicely designed. I feel the cockpit is lacking though.

No support, and they don't get used at all. Nice TLC. :-| Now we get cooking! This pic shows the tail added on and the more bulk being built.

Please comment if you want to! A great set review, as always. Nice try making a review of a set that was not red. It almost worked! Maybe next time. *sweet* One thing I noticed is that a bunch of your pictures are missing the beam that goes over the left hand wheel as a fender. Like this picture: What kind of camera do you use? The pictures have very good depth of field, meaning that both the foreground and the background are in good focus. This is usually hard to do without a very small aperture. Yes, "reminiscing" is a word. It means to fondly remember the past. I also noticed that the engine was sticky. Set 8408 has the same problem. It took me forever to figure out what the problem was. If you take the engine out of the model, it turns nice and smooth. Then when you put it back in, it works terrible. It turns out the key is that, in the back, there is an 8 tooth spur gear and a 24 tooth crown gear used as a spur. If you look at Technica, you will see that there are two different crown gears. One of them works well mated with an 8 tooth on parallel axles, and the other one doesn\'t. The difference is only supposed to be longer teeth, so it really should not matter, but it does. If your set works bad, try switching the crown gear to one of the other variety. Worked for me.

Recently I got a bag of Lego Technic parts where there have been mixed three sets: 8858, 8829 and 8235 The resurrection of 8858 has been described by me in a separate post. Going back to the Dune Buggy \xe2\x80\x93 when I saw it for the first time back in 1994 I did not like it, as I was always big fan of 8840 (which I consider to the day the best looking Buggy) and set 8829 looked to me ugly. So there were those all parts in the bag\xe2\x80\xa6 then I though why not build it ? And I started to do it. When I finished I was very surprised how the final look of this set is! Really taking my words back. Unfortunately in the bag there were missing some parts and I could not rebuild the back spoiler. So I made some changes to it and make it from spare parts that I have and it came out acceptable. I also added some additional parts such as \xe2\x80\x9cfake\xe2\x80\x9d steering wheel, \xe2\x80\x9cRally\xe2\x80\x9d logo, antennas. I have also reverse mounting of the rear tires \xe2\x80\x93 why Lego did them like that I never know \xe2\x80\x93 as I think they look better this way. Set: well the review has been already made by owner of this post so I will only add few things into it. Engine \xe2\x80\x93 V2 (aired cooled?) is driven by 4 gears -> from the single wheel (no differential as in 8840) using two old school z14 tooth bevel , then by z24 tooth crown and z8 tooth type 1. Actually the (as in most old sets) the pistons are moving very fast (not as in current sets) and smooths \xe2\x80\x93 I needed to extra clean all engine parts as there was a lot friction. Suspension \xe2\x80\x93 set has \xe2\x80\x9cengine bay\xe2\x80\x9d working using two old gray shock absorbers 6,5l \xe2\x80\x93 the movement is not big but works very nice, better then in 8840 in my opinion. Steering \xe2\x80\x93 this is a bit odd as there is no direct connection to HoG as in most old sets, but first the gear rack is moved by z8 then two z14 tooth where reverse movement is taking place. Later connection of two old school z14 tooth bevel goes to HoG Details \xe2\x80\x93 this is the most that I like in this set, specially how the use of axle pin connector perpendicular and 1x10 bricks with 3x3 cut corners and plate 1x5 toothed ends 2 studs with center axle hole are making the body shape \xe2\x80\x93 is just wonder. Tires \xe2\x80\x93 the balloon rear are pretty nice the front is a new version of those that were in 8840. What I do not like: 1. Missing of Technic Figure (8840 had it.) 2. no steering wheel in the original set 3. no differential \xe2\x80\x93 but having in mind that Lego has introduce 24-12 teeth would be difficult to build the transmission in such small space where the engine is. I will shortly upload new pictures and post them here later on . Over all \xe2\x80\x93 I think it is worth buying it as it is very payable !

I like your nomenclature for the BJST. Acronyms always sound nicely scientific; much better than "digger". No one would know you made it up until they found out what it means. I also really like what I will call your "kinetic photos". They convey a sense of motion and show the range of the mechanism without the big file sizes of animations. How long of a shutter speed did you use? The secret to not getting too much friction in the turntable is using extra nuts and jamming them together. You don\'t want to actually clamp the nuts tight across the turntable. You want to jam two nuts tightly together at each end which prevents them from unwinding, but still leave a little free play (gap). This way it will hold the assembly together but not prevent it from moving. Mine moves quite easily. This same concept is used on the pen plotter or 8094. "Slewed"? I think that\'s a word. How about "slewn" or "slain" or "slewifacated"?

That is unacceptable. It is imperative that you put a mortgage on your house immediately to get it! *sweet* Yes, 8824 is a good white set. I also see from your room photos that you have the 8839 Supply Ship which has lots of white. This is a really nice set. 8462 is hard to call old school, but at least it uses regular beams. The air tanks are the best part of the set. I wish LEGO had used them more often, especially on the highly pneumatic sets. The tank makes all the difference on 8459. You are right, 8458 is certainly not old school, but it is a great set with wonderful suspension. It is of the same era as the Super Street Sensation with all of the panels for body contouring. 8868 is Technic at its best. There is nothing else like it, especially with the compressor.

While the assembly you have drawn would work as a linear actuator, I would not recommend it. The torsional stiffness and strength of an axle are proportional to the polar moment of inertia, a section property. Most of the stiffness comes from the outside of the cross shaped axle. But in the threaded axle, you lose all the stiffness of the outer area because it is not continuous. This means you only get stiffness and strength from the small core.

They made many changes to Technic the following year, with models becoming predominantly studless and making heavy use of the flexible axles/hoses and decorative panels.

This is my second review and the first review of this paticular set and the only one on EuroBricks... at the moment X-D So without further ado I present to you my review... (I like that saying so much I decided to use it again in this review, it\'s originally from my review of 8158, which can be seen here.) Note: Sorry that this review got delayed, but there was a hostile takeover of the computer, X-O don\'t worry everythings fine now. X-D Set: 8159 Racer X Vs Taejo Theme: Speed Racer Price: $19.99US Pieces: 237 Minifigs: 2 Note 2: I did not take photos of just the new pieces this time because they\'re the same "new" pieces as in 8158, just in diff. colors. If you want to see a picture of them click here. First off pictures of the Box, Instructions, DSS, and Minifigs: Not quite as many stickers as set 8158, but there still are quite a few. Can you guess which ones which? :-D Yes, Taejo\'s hair really is Red and Black, for Racer X\'s head TLG just reused the baddie\'s head from 7620. |-/ Now onto the build: First Racer X\'s X Racer :-D (Thats not it\'s official name.. I think.) :-$ Back end of the car. The cockpit, and yeah there are no seats for Racer X\'s hiny, just a flat 2x2 Dark Bley plate. The cockpit and rearend of the car connect using an S-shaped connector piece. The front part of the car. The fornt and the cockpit are also connected using an S-shaped connector piece. Adding some details including Yellow fenders. The underside of the car, so far. Adding some more detail. Newly added motor vents and smooth details. Adding a front bumper, amongst other things. Side view of the car, so far. "No backseat driving, wait a minute, there\'s no backseat!" The underside with newly added axles. Demonstrating how hubcap piece is put on the car. Now onto Taejo\'s GRR (Glorious Red Racer) :-P Front part of the car. Cockpit, regular seats... check. Cocpit and rearend of the car connected using S-shaped connector piece. Adding some detail. The front part of the car. Front and cockpit connected also using the S-shaped connector piece. Adding some fenders to the car. Underside of the car, so far. Adding some smooth details. Taejos is the only car with an actual hood. Side view of the car, so far. Underside of the car with axels. Now some finished shots of both cars: First Racer X\'s fine Black and Yellow racer Reminds me of an older Ferrari from this angle. Up close and personal. I\'m guessing the 3 holes are exhaust outlets. Racer X rollin\'. Now it\'s time for Taejo\'s Red racer "I could\'ve sworn I ordered some hubcaps!" -guess who... Taejo Racer X admiring Taejo\'s fine red automobile. Up close with \'Big Red\'. Rearend shot of the car. "I challenge you Racer X!" -Taejo Racer X bein\' a complete badass and smokin\' Taejo. >:-) Now for some comparison shots: (The Silver pocket knife is just to hold up Taejo\'s car.) Now a shot of the extra pieces: Now if you combine 8158 with 8159, you get this: "Go, Go, Go!" Now it\'s time for the summary: This set is an excellent buy at $20 dollars, it\'s well designed and has lot\'s of details, it also has very unique minifigs. (Which are always good in a set.) It\'s only downfalls are the lack of acessories for the minifigs and that there are no cool contraptions on the cars, and by "cool" I mean lethal to the other racer(s). Now to the scoring of the set: Price:10/10 Pieces: 8/10 Too many stickers for such a small set. Minifigs: 10/10 Unique and creative. Playability: 9/10 Would have been perfect except for the lack of acessories and cool contraptions on the cars. (But both are easily modified/fixed hence the nine.) Overall: 37/40 A great set! Bonus: Try and count how many times my Silver pocket knife appears and win... the knowledge of knowing how many times the Silver pocket knife appears. :-P :-D This concludes the review, more pictures of either set 8158 or 8159 or both available through request, via PM-ing me. ;-) See ya\' next time folks... of course I don\'t mean that literally X-D ...

The box General info You get 193 pieces (vs 206 for Cool Cars) which is quite a lot, but most of them are small. There are a lot of hinges and some good slopes and wings. The building instructions contains three models, but no further ideas for inspiration. Primary model: Spider The first model is a big spider which shares some similarities to the secondary model of 4895 Power in the design. The legs each have 3 joints, where the ones in the middle have "stud joints" to be moved sideways while the rest use hinges for all joints. There are 8 of them and it does get a little tedious with all the repetitive building in this relatively small model. I like the design of the face with a lot of eyes and a big and ugly mouth, but the real gem is the X-pattern on the opisthosoma made using double/inverted slopes. It is poseable and I think it looks more "fierce" when inverted. Secondary model: Snake The face of the snake is nicely detailed with a splitting tongue and a mouth than can move a little. There is a problem with the construction. It uses stacked hinges for some of the joints, which are hard to pull apart without stressing the pieces. Tertiary model: Fly I\'m not completely sure what this insect is. I will say it\'s a fly, although the tail and head are too pointy. This is a neat little thing. Conclusion Primary model: 8 It is a good design, but lacks some sturdiness in the legs. They fall off a little too easily. Secondary models: 6 They are pretty good when you look at the bricks that are available, but they don\'t wow you in any way and they suffer from the same issues as the primary model regarding sturdiness. Alternate models: 3 It is hard to come up with alternate models with so many small pieces and plates that are only 1 stud wide. The colors might make you want to build a Spyrius space ship. Playability: 8 The models have many movable joints and you can put quite a scare into your minifigs when their town gets attacked by these creatures... unless some EN forces are there to protect them. Price: 6 Creator sets are known for their great price to bricks ratio, but this set doesn\'t quite measure up to sets like Cool Cars. Pieces: 7 The pieces aren\'t great by themselves, but who doesn\'t need a fist full of hinges, slopes and basic plates in standard colors? I don\'t think this is a must-have set like the big rig was last year. The pieces are great and it has a nice primary model, but the set lacks a bit when it comes to the usual strong Creator qualities like alternate models and price.

It was released as a Legend set in 2001, but due to poor sales was discontinued again. The largest of the Islander sets, Enchanted Island is a portion of an island with a river running through. The left hand side features some sturdy buildings built into a tree-like structure on a rocky outcrop, whilst the left hand side features a tower built out of "wooden" posts and a large tribal statue. The box cover shows all the details; it does, however, differ from the instructions\' finished product in that it has been more aesthetically arranged - bushes e.t.c. have been moved to fill in gaps and to not obscure other things. The sides of the box show nothing particularly special, although in one scene it depicts the Islander Canoe chasing the Pirate boat with the treasure; just one way to play with the set. The back of the box, however, is superb, featuring a large number of alternative models: a toothy statue, a Pirate tree (think Wolfpack) with an Islander base, Kahuka\'s throne, a fire-breathing statue and a souped-up boat for the pirates. These, and many more, can be easily made because of the large diversity of pieces. The set has a huge number of minifigures for its size, the third highest number in the Pirate range (The SES and the BSB being first and second, respectively) - a whopping 7! 5 Islanders, including the all-too-common King Kahuka, the elusive Islander babe and 3 standard warriors - this set alone will never leave you short of enemies! 2 pirates, Ironhook in his standard attire with a scurvy dog at his side attack the island, although they are only moderately armed - 2 cutlasses and a pistol between them; a musket would\'ve been nice. The Islanders, on the other hand, have 4 shields, a bow and quiver and 6 spears, not to mention the big pokey thing with horns on top (Weapon? Idol? Staff?). A monkey, parrot and crocodile provide the obvious creature features, with a fair amount of gold to finish off. In the instructions, the goblet does not have the lid, although it does on the box; it\'s a nice touch anyway - adding a little more diversity to the monotonous treasure stashes. The pirates\' boat is a nice 2 sail vessel, with oars for when the wind stops and a treasure map. The sails are similar to those in Lagoon Lockup, but with an extra front sail. It\'s an awesome little boat, better for raids than a rowing boat, but not too big that it can\'t sail up rivers. It can comfortably fit 2 men and, at a squeeze, 5. The sails are expensive if you buy them seperately; normally this won\'t be a problem, but they can cost aroun $5 each. The Islanders\' boat is a canoe with a sail and an outrigger to stabilise it. The sail is beautifully done, with 2 spars taughtening it. There is a clip for the rower to leave his weapon when at se and the mast can turn to get as much wind as possible. It\'s quite a top-heavy boat, but it doesn\'t look hideous and without the mast/sail it looks great. 3 Islanders can fit in it, and more if they sit on the outrigger. The markings on the canoe are stickers, but they look fine and are probably more robust than markings for their job. Furthermore, they\'re waterproof! *sing* Kahuka\'s throne can be carried by 2 loyal subjects... ...Or strapped to his pet crocodile! The clips on the side can be used to rest his weaponry, or hold spears for battle. The throne looks nice, although I\'m not too sure about the blue against the red - I\'d have prefered white as it would clash less... An overview of the island; it is built in 2 halves - left then right and then joined together loosley, so it can be seperated for transporting. Around the back to the left and right, there are large open spaces that are great for battles - this set isn\'t so much about a large solid build, but creating a "village" - smaller structures linked by bridges. And the back... To the far left is a platform built onto the rock, with access from the river via a ladder. There\'s the standard Islander drum with the lovely zebra-skin part (Where did they get that?!). I\'ve never understood the white flag - I was under the impression it was used for surrender... Further along the rocky bank, there are some hinged palm leaves that swing upwards to reveal... ...The treasure! It\'s an OK hiding place; not the best place to hide it, right where the pirates sail past, but it feels fabulous; it fits right in. Above it on the rocky bank is the main structure. It looks very disjointed when you build it (bricks all over the place), but once it\'s done it looks nice and rural, with leaves everywhere and the "balcony" where Kahuka is standing. You get a nice roof made from 2 large palm leaves tilting down. Around the back there\'s a slight shelter, a table for picnics and a ladder to access the upstairs. I was rather annoyed that it is so open, but the set is designed from just one perspective... To the left is the bridge to the other building... A nice, one piece bridge made of the softer plastic used for muskets and the post-1991 cutlasses. It looks good, but be warned! It tilts when you pull a pin, sending the pirates flying! This contraption is a good idea, but it is very stiff and so doesn\'t swing, even when burdened by a minifigure - you\'ll want to modify this bit if you get it. The other building looks like it is made out of posts and beams. They are all red; brown would have been better, but it would have added too many colours to the range, just like the use of black for trees in some forestmen sets. There are 3 clips for spare weapons; only 2 of these will ever be used when all the Islanders are armed, but it gives the pirates scope once they\'ve been disarmed...There\'s another nice palm tree roof on top. 2 ladders give access...there\'s a total of 4 in this set - worth getting, eh? Although they\'re 5p on Bricklink, for a KABOB, they\'re like gold! At the top there\'s another hidey hole; the palm leaves lift up on hinges to show the treasure or hiding Islander. It can be seen from behind, but this set is designed from one perspective only. Nice cattlehorns too...alongside the slats you can see in the floor - 5 years later and it would\'ve been a solid plate... The big statue is one of the main selling point of this set, alongside the tilting bridge - they\'re the action features shown in every catalogue at the time, but it is not really special, just original. The statue fits in with the theme perfectly - Kahuka\'s mask, his shield and this statue all depict the same deity, which is a nice "collectible" idea. The back is rather plain, except the angled 1x1 bricks - a good touch. I\'m not sure why there\'s a black brick in the back of the head, but this is easily remedied; it could even be done with a brick from this same set, just swapping the two over... Aside from the head turning, the back can open to store sacred objects, or, in my opinion, prisoners, hence the gaps for breathing. Either way, it\'s a lovely piece of architecture and deservedly a flagship element of the set. There\'s your standard cooking pot floating around, although a 1x1 yellow stud as human flesh (remember, minifigs are yellow, no matter what the licensed themes say!) is a superb finish. This set is a stunning set for both kids and AFOLs who are just getting back into Lego/Pirates - it is a great army builder and, due to its release as a Legend, is extremely cheap on eBay - you should be able to pick one up for \xc2\xa318, or \xc2\xa315 if you\'re lucky. For that you get a lifetime\'s supply of Islanders, 4 ladders, some wall panels, 2 baseplates (one raised and both with rivers and printed vegetation around the edge), a ton of weapons, a fair quantity of standard bricks, but most of all, a heap of vegetation: This is an easy to buy set, with normally around 5 on eBay at any time, and is well worth it, for the parts, the play and the nostalgia! It can be easily modified; when used in conjunction with any other outpost, a much larger fortress can be made, especially if more rope bridges are used. if you pick 2 of this fine set off eBay (It\'ll still be less than the original price!), a huge complex can be constructed, giving you an instantaneous village for around \xc2\xa335.

And I WILL. It\'s just the time that is blocking me. And my university. And the fact that I just picked up 8460 in original box for only EUR 36,50...! *sweet* The other reviews will follow - please bear with me. And this set review is also a gift to this nice fellow who gave me the title! That\'s what I\'m talking about: #1 useless information with high numbers: This set contains 841 parts and was released in 1995 in the TECHNIC / Tech Build / Advanced (sub-) theme. The bricklink price guide displays for \xe2\x80\x9cUsed\xe2\x80\x9d a Qty Avg Price of $125.85 and for \xe2\x80\x9cNew\xe2\x80\x9d a Qty Avg Price of $212.82. I got it for $56,98. Still can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. :\'-) This set was rereleased two times (8431 in 2002 and 8438 in 2003). #2 the box: Front: Back: Open: The box is higher than other Technic boxes. Why? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. 8460 doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any real large parts. Whatever. Inlay: I wonder why TLG doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make inlays anymore\xe2\x80\xa6 They\xe2\x80\x99re noisy and brake easily but are great for (pre-) sorting. #3 building instructions: I will quote myself from the 8862 review: Quote Wow these instructions are used! I\'m not used to this after all this sets with unread instruction booklets... Triple-wow! \xe2\x80\x98nuff said. This is the \xe2\x80\x9cfirst\xe2\x80\x9d page. (Fortunately Peeron offers scans!) The last step for the alternate model and a few nice photos showing how the pneumatic pump will be erm- pumped. Yeah. Random page: I forgot the overall thoughts to the instructions: These are Technic instructions as we\xe2\x80\x99re used to them: part count, easy to understand (okay, the string part at the end was too much for me) and the color distinction is okay too. 100 pages long and if I can trust my eyes the pneumatics page can be fold out. (I don\xe2\x80\x99t have this page but I assume it.) #4 the parts: #5 building: An easy and fun build. Okay, this could take some time. My longest building review up to date. The front steering: The rear steering. The axle pin between the rear steering is for the axle which rotates the crane. The two worm screws in the front are for the outriggers (they\xe2\x80\x99re not linked. One for each side.) The small wheel in the back is for the rotation. Adjusting front and rear steering. outriggers are finished. You can notice a 8 tooth gear that will rotate the Technic Turntable. A steering wheel has been added. Could be the same stickers like the alternate 8880 used to have. The steering can be operated with both actinic lights (?) No. We\xe2\x80\x99re far from finished. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot of parts left at this point. Wow. A 4x4 corner plate! Pneumatics and a winch: If you can\xe2\x80\x99t recognize it on the photo: The Technic Beams are the erm- wrong/other side up. The 1x6 Technic Beams on the left side are normal. The axle that will extend the crane: 7 gear racks 1x4 the 1x6 Technic plate will keep the two pneumatic cylinders straight. *sad* 8-| Huh? Did you blink? You missed a special part: The whole rotatable thing will be attached to the Technic turntable using two long Technic pins. The pin on the right side should be in the middle of the three \xe2\x80\x9cturntable holes\xe2\x80\x9d. On the right side, it\xe2\x80\x99s the first hole. Asymmetric! Why? Because we\xe2\x80\x99ll add a cute cab! #6 functionality: You can find the features in comparison to other Technic cranes here. Technopedia, of course. I made one "sentence" out of it: (please don\xe2\x80\x99t find any mistakes.) :-P \xe2\x80\x9ctwo axle rack and pinion steering, pneumatic luffing and gear driven telescoping via crank for the boom which can slew 360\xc2\xb0 on turntable driven via gear, crank driven hoist and gear driven outriggers at four corners which snap over center.\xe2\x80\x9d #7 random shots: Comparison to 8854: uuuh\xe2\x80\xa6 once again a depth of field. I tried to make it look authoritarian like 8858 but I failed. Somehow 8460 looks cute. #8 comparison to 8421 Mobile Crane / Crane Truck: I feel that a question concerning this will be asked, so I deal with it right now. First of all: I don\xe2\x80\x99t own 8421 yet. I know. A Technic freak really should own it. Anyway: 8421 has more than twice as much parts as 8460, is motorized, features a V6-engine and a very neat mechanism to extend the crane/boom twice using a braided string with end studs. Try to find out how! Of course 8421 features (far) more than 8460. IMHO 8421 should have been a copy of 8460, a set so successful that it has been rereleased two times, but the designers overshoot the mark. 8421 is a (breathtaking) monster. Compared to it, 8460 looks cute - not pale! #9 final thoughts: I got it on eBay in kind of good condition, for about 50 dollars. I know that it has been worth the money in any point of view. *wub* I didn\xe2\x80\x99t use the word \xe2\x80\x9cold-school\xe2\x80\x9d for now. I\xe2\x80\x99ll change that: 8460 belongs to the favored few of old-school Technic sets! thanks for reading and viewing the pictures, I hope you enjoyed it!

You have managed to review my all time favourite technic set! It was the first large Technic set I was given by my parents, when it first came out in 1995. I played for hours with this set, making minifig seats in it (it was so huge there was room for four minifigs to sit next to eachother in front....) I made various applications for it, a bungee-jump system with a large rubber band, and lots of containers to be lifted. The first changes I made included the inverting of the wheels and the disabling of one of the flashlight-steering wheels because they obstructed eachother. By the way, the nob for your winch is yellow instead of black (I know this set by heart, so watch out :-P ). I always liked those nobs. I do own the 8421 and I can tell you: this 8460 is much, much stronger, it can carry more weight because the boom is lighter then the 8421: they are powered by the same two pistons... You know when you made it right: when the crane is in upright position, fully extended and you release the brake from the winch. Does the hook lower without having to pull it? If it does, you succeeded in constructing the set right. The alternate model was great fun too, the pump is cleverly hidden and the crane folds up great between the cab and the loading platform. You could easily mod it with a pneumatic claw on the crane, a motor to turn it and a compressor. The only flaw was the loading platform which had no floor (only some axles).

The box designs in general are crappier these days than they used to be 10 years ago. You don\'t see the old "featured parts" trays anymore and the boxes don\'t have the different sections either (these also acted as internal supports for larger boxes, so they were less prone to being crushed). The cardboard material is also quite a bit thinner. I think it\'s a result of TLC\'s overall cost-cutting moves since then. Most people toss the boxes and probably don\'t care, but I keep all of them. There was actually a time when the boxes used to be even stronger. I have an old 8859 set and the outer box is made of a hard, styrofoam material, although they probably stopped using that for environmental reasons.

It allows the single motor to be used for two functions. This system has been around for a while, and Lego seem to be using it more and more. The Transmission Driving Ring alone (the red circle) goes for $5-15 USD on BrickLink, and you also need the Catch and Clutch Gear so I have been buying sets that have them instead. I now have enough parts to make a Supercar gearbox. (I bet a new supercar comes out next year now...) This is the gear that rotates the arm. Note the colour of the 24 tooth gear; it seems to be a new gear trend. A lot of work has been put into this truck looking real. Personally I think they went too far as the truck seems to have been designed for a tilting cab, but it's disabled to prevent breaking the front. Bottom of the transmission. The bottom shaft lifts the arm. Note that there are more dark grey gears. The motor fits in very well also. The bottom of the arm. I was surprised by the usage of a 12 Tooth Bevel to link with the 36 Tooth Double Bevel as I had never seen that done before. As you can see there is no room for any drive train. Standard steering for a recent technic truck. There is a hand-of-god at the cab top that links via two Knob Wheels. It looks good from the back. You can also see the white Clutch that connects the transmission to the motor to avoid burnouts. It goes decently high, and can go a bit higher if you use the crane arm. Compared to last years fire truck. (If I didn't buy the fire truck for half price I would have been annoyed that Lego brought out what is almost a motorised version of the same set.) Functions: Cherry Picker Arm: Motorised rotate and lift that links to a motor via a transmission and anti-burnout clutch. Steering: Rack and pinion controlled via a hand-of-god linked by Knob Wheels Doors: Open and close. Good functionality that works well, but I wish they made the cab lift and I'm a bit sick of the lame fairing door trick. 7/10 Parts: Motor, battery box, transmission, clutch, practical wheels, only two fairings, compact turntable... this is a great parts set. 10/10 Price: At $99.99 AUD for 726 parts it's OK value when you consider what you are getting. The US price is $60.00 which is better, but still not great. I bought mine for $80 AUD which was good however, and I suspect that the price is designed for easy sale...8/10 Looks: I'd buy this for the looks alone! 9/10 Fudge: The functions work well and I llked it more than I thought I would. Oddly mine seemed to be missing a Axle Pin with Friction, but since it includes extra parts for the alternate model I didn't mind using one of my spares. On the subject of the alternate model, it is a dump truck which is made out to be a total re-build, but it isn't. It could have easily been done like Super Street Sensation was, but Lego have probably determined that instructions like that confuse people. 8/10 Overall: Recommended. 8/10", u'0.857143', [(u'neg', u'0.049075'), (u'neutral', u'0.125606'), (u'pos', u'0.825319')]), ('Great review!

Luckily I\'m a sucker for spooky old temples, filled with devilish traps and hidden treasures, hissing fountains and overgrown foliage, creepy skeletons and crumbling stonework, so here it is: Indiana Jones 7627, Temple of the Crystal Skull. Part 1: The Figs First off, the figs - 6 humans and 4 skellies (or should that be skullies? ) Indy, Mutt, Irina, and that sneery Russian guy that\'s in the 2 smaller sets. Nothing new here. Aha! What have we here - two natives. I wonder if hair is a sign of power in this culture, since one guy is completely bald and the other one has the most extraordinarily luxurious black mullet. Somehow I doubt the movie will answer this question. Back view - as you can see, the scalp tattoos are also popular in this tribe. Fashion conscious! (Note in the background the paws of the fearsome black jungle panther, ie my cat, curious as to see what the tribe was up to.) Also, don\'t ask me why these guys are carrying axes rather than, say, spears. And what everyone\'s been waiting for, the skullies - three of \'em and a conquistador skellie - very cute. Note the backs of the crystal head have a plume-sized hole - or maybe that\'s just where they injected the blue brain-plastic. Spooky! I love these skulls, I wasn\'t sold from the initial pics but they have a very creepy smile and the head shape is just... weird. With the large eyes, it\'s kind of Homer Simpson-esque. And here we have the token vehicle in the set - a weird little tank thing with treads. Kind of looks like a cross between the amphibious boat and a mini-tank. I\'m sure there\'s a military expert around here who can tell us exactly what it is supposed to be. The treads are nice, but the rest of it is a bit thrown together. You can tell they wanted to keep the dark green colour scheme but the budget only allowed them 5 parts to do so . All in all, a mixed bag with the figs. 4 repeats from the cheaper sets which means we have one new native figure and the crystal skullies. There are heaps of the old-skool skele heads scattered around the sets so those that prefer can replace the skullies with ordinary skellies. Bizarrely, the top of the box which has the line of 1:1 figs pic (you know what I mean) doesn\'t have names for any of the characters, whereas all the smaller sets do. Part 2: Box, Parts Front of box: Back of box: Two instruction books: Parts. This set has come under criticism for being overpriced - myself included - but the official piece count is 900 plus, which is pretty good considering it also contains the baseplate. 6 big bags and 2 of those 12x12 bricks in dark tan. (Note: set does not contain live Black Jungle Panther\xe2\x84\xa2) The DSS, helpfully comes pre-scrunched thanks to TLC. Even in a $AUD150 set they can\'t get that right... sigh. The dark tan baseplate. Say what you like, I\'m in love. I know some people don\'t like these, but they were such a staple of Castle/ Pirates for so many years that I don\'t consider them a juniorised piece at all. This one, recycled from the 05 Police HQ and 06 Hospital, is much better in design than the King Leo\'s Castle one as the different heights and asymmetry make it look much more like a natural piece of ground. Perfect for MOCs. And it\'s dark tan - how could anyone not love such a huge slab of dark tan? Note this love doesn\'t extend to applying the stonework stickers which are, frankly, crap. Random instructions page: Part 3: Temple of Doom - or just a doomed temple? The complete set, front view. Isometricish view: Back view: Top view: First impressions? It\'s very dark tan, isn\'t it? And green. And bright green. And dark green. And dark red. And normal tan. And dark bley. And pearl gold! In fact, it\'s a bit of a mish-mash of colours. I\'m of two minds about this. I kind of prefer the palette to be a bit subtler, but I can see that a playset designed for kids isn\'t going to sell bucketloads all tastefully done in shades of tan with lashings of dark-green foliage. There\'s a huge amount of dark red in this set, which is always a welcome colour, but I\'m not convinced it quite works with the 2 shades of tan on offer here. On the plus side, there\'s also a huge amount of dark tan in ordinary 2x2 bricks, tiles, plates and 1x1 and 1x2x3 slopes, which is great for anyone wanting to stock up. Let\'s take a closer look. I\'ll do this roughly in order of the build itself: a) The big scary face. This is a simple, fun build and very effective at projecting menace at the temple entrance. It actually detaches very easily from the temple (as pictured on the box art) to allow easier access to the inside. The eyes are flick-fire missiles, with Scary Face\'s hair conveniently providing ammo refills should you run out. All in all, from me. (b) The Back Spin the skelly head and stone steps appear - we haven\'t seen this feature in a while. Nice to get these pieces in dark bley. A conquistador hides under the stairs - this is a bit useless as the stairs can\'t fully extend while he\'s there . Moving right... a trapdoor - what could possibly be behind it??!!??!!? Answer: not much, really. A little red stair. I really like these 2 stickers though - very intricate. The staircase leads to what I like to think of as the Crystal Skull Transmogrification Chamber. Now, I know nothing about the movie except that it\'s supposed to be have a kind of 50s B-movie plot rumoured to feature (look away, spoiler-haters)..... aliens. These weird, creepy gold chairs look made from the bones of aliens if you ask me, with their strange vertebrae and silver claws. It wouldn\'t surprise me if bringing these aliens back to life was part of the plot of the movie... hence the crystal skull? I guess we\'ll find out May 22. In any case, transforming aliens clearly like a disco whirl as when you pull the handle, the whole of this assembly spins giddily around. A very clever and simple trick - it\'s basically just a wheel under the platform but the effect is great. Also under here is a bottomless pit (stickered)... I would very much expect a villian to be thrown down it at some point. "So, do you come here often?" "I don\'t know who designed this club. These chairs are REALLY uncomfortable." NB. I am really, really over those pearl gold 1x2 roof corner slopes which started popping up in the 2006 Castle range, infected Exo-Force and have now spread here. Can we please have these in a different colour? Or a different pearl gold piece? Pretty please? ( c) Left tower (looking from the front) A small tower with a trans clear gem. (d) Right tower Waterfall with booby trap. I like the sticker, it\'s very cartoony, which fits with the set somehow. When you turn the wheel, flick fire missiles spray out and hit whoever is on the stairs. Both towers have a trap where if you move the skull, another one pops out from the dragon mouth. (e) Central turret thing This thing is kind of annoying and doesn\'t really sit or work well. It\'s kind of like a laser beam sending messages to space, I guess. As the central dome rises, the two plates peel away. I find it is a little bit tight to work smoothly and the two plates doesn\'t really sit well together at the top. Maybe I just need to rebuild it. I\'m sure this will also be explained in the movie. (f) Final trap - the stair that isn\'t there The final trap is at the front - as Indy goes down the staircase, you can push the red heads and all the 1x8 bley bricks come tumbling down. Simple and works well. (g) Alternate view Here\'s how it looks as pictured on the box with the head removed. As you can see, this allows better access to the centre of the temple. As you can see, sadly there is nothing actually interesting there except a staircase to the turret and 2 dark tan slopes which are just stuck there and look a little out of place. I mean, come on, everything else has a splash of dark red and gold! Your Destination: Nowhere! Part 4: In Conclusion So after all those endless pics, what about the set itself? CONS:As a playset, 7627 doesn\'t quite make sense. Admittedly, the traps that are there are well-designed and unobtrusive. On the other hand, there\'s a great big whopping entrance at the front - but I wasn\'t sure if the figs are supposed to sneak in through the backdoor and go up the spiral staircase and past the waterfall (as shown in the box art) or if they were meant to end up in the golden skull room. The middle area doesn\'t really connect with anything, nor does the giant space turret. It may be that some of these questions are answered in the film, but whereas with 7624, 7625 and 7626 I could at least picture a story myself (eg with River Chase is fairly obvious what\'s happening - a chase down a river with a croc and a communist staking them out)!, the Temple set is a little all over the place. The design feels a little off to me - not really bad but not really great either. PROS: On the plus side, the natives and crystal skulls themselves are great. At 900+ pieces, this is also a great parts pack for dark tan, dark red, plant pieces, gold oddments etc. I especially love the baseplate in that shade. I like the overall shape of the temple - a big staircase with secret nooks and crannies. The build is reasonably interesting and there are some clever tricks with the traps. But upon reflection I shouldn\'t have to sell this set - it should be able to sell itself! As I said before, I\'m a huge fan of dark, mysterious old temples so for that I have to give it some love. It reminds me of the big old Adventurers sets and the whiff of nostalgia is itself a powerful intoxicant. However, for the price Lego is selling it in Australia/ Europe/ Canada I couldn\'t recommend it as a must-buy for full price when the smaller sets in this series are themselves so good.

Great review! Now I'm really truly convinced that I'm gonna buy this set. My faith was a little wobbly, but its benn restored Anyway, I just wanted to point out that the temple's entrance might actually be the turret thing. If you watch the teaser, there are some very similair stone pillars surrounded by sand (there are 4 not 2 though ) and when they close up it looks like all our characters are sucked into the sand and magically appear underground going through some stone plates(which act like steps to go down) that dissapear. So, in theory those steps beneath the turret are actualy the entrance, and I'm asumming from this picture That the steps with 1x8 bricks with the dragon heads at the end lead us of somewhere else. All in all this temple looks like a mixed up version of the real temple, which is fine by me (SIDENOTE: I'm not sure but based on minifig inclusion, either Lego was cheap or Colonel Dovchenko is dead by the time Irina and her goons reach the temple, I'll wait till I see the movie. ) Edited by Belloq, 02 May 2008 - 02:14 AM.", u'0.842105', [(u'neg', u'0.0216502'), (u'neutral', u'0.500917'), (u'pos', u'0.477433')]), ("trooperdavinfelth, on May 1 2008, 05:06 PM, said: Absolute hogwash.

This is my first review of a set ever, don\'t be too mean. 1) Box It captures the potential (I don\'t know how the scene plays out... for now ) action of the scene nicely and is very pleasing, good job TLC . On the back it shows some of the play features of the set and a net little comic. Indiana Jones seems to be surprisingly calm considering that he is about to be captured under a net and attacked by a snake (the thing he fears most). 1a) comic not much to say on this... 1b) screw up At the top of the box, both "Russian Guards" have the same grining face, in the set one has the generic bad guy face from 7620. 2) Contents The box opens up to reveal a quartet of bags, an un-crumpled manual (YAY!), and a sticker sheet (BOO!) 2a) DSS Yoda said every for of rambling imaginable about this accursed item, I have nothing to say. Meh... 3) Minifigs The only thing that has not really been discussed about the figs that you get in this set is that Marion has a slightly new torso. 4) Parts of interest When I opened up the baggies, these were the components that grabbed my attention. A DARK GREEN alligator, a net piece that I Know has appeared in sets before hand ( I needed it for a MOC I am working on), some raft part that is probably very old, a ladder with two pairs of hindges, and a DARK brown version of this part. 4) Build (amphibious vehicle) This I one of the more enjoyable builds of the new line. But that is just my opinion. You start of with some thing very simple... By the end of the next page, it starts to bulk up More detail... Beginning to look like a car... 4a) Build (rear attachment) Bulk it up and add Taillights... Done... Slap it on to the main vehicle... 4b) Build (Front attachment) I am running out of things to say... Bulk it up... Add some detail... Add a gun and headlights... And attach to the rest to get the completed vehicle... Add stickers... I honestly think that the amphibious vehicle looks much better with the stickers than without... 5) Build (boat) This build goes by rather quickly and adds to the playability of the final set. Base... Apply clamps... Add more to engine... Build more detail and a gun base... Finished boat... Plus stickers... I love how Lego slips in the product number into their stickers. 6) Build (tree fort) This is the weakest part of the whole set. But I find my self liking it more and more for some odd and inexplicable reason. That tan 6x6 will most likely see use in a pirate themed vinigete soon (not mine ). Install net-launcher... You spend the next two pages building this... And putting it on... A tree branch that is an ugly mix of brown, dark brown, and frown... (our commie friend seems to like coffee a lot) Second branch... 3rd... (a wee bit to much on the coffee there, don\'t you think?) Final step... The only redeeming value of this section is how well the net launcher works, fantastically. The rest is just utter fail. 7) Spare parts Very little in terms of what is left over... Finished set...

Four years later we passed through Luxembourg and I remembered the city and the store. We made a detour and stopped by the same store.

I use the baseplates a lot in my cities, they serve well as roads with parking spaces next to them.

Up for review today is 8160 Cruncher Block and Racer X as part of Batbrick and iamded reviews: Here is the box, I have to say I love the art on it. It\'s very colourful and makes the truck look a lot less crap than it does on the box. Plus, you have to love the "Missile launching action" bit right, am I right? Why are you all staring at me? And here is the back. Pretty generic, but shows some nice details and so forth. Oh dear! In turning around the box have I killed myself AND iamded!? Okey dokey, up first is the best part of the entire set: the minifigs! Racer X is wonderful, though coming with a boring Bruce Wayne face. But it is Cruncher Block, his lady Driver Taejo that really shine. Look at those awesome suits! The cool faces! Taejo has a ripped shirt! Now up is the first building part of the set, with me and iamded looking rather slick in X\'s car. While I\'m not a big fan of yellow, it is very nice, and slopes in an underused colour is better than no slopes at all: Front view, the new windshields are fantastic: While a very cool car, it is rather silly of TLC to give us the exact same one we got in the smaller set. I didn\'t get the smaller set with this car, so I\'m still happy, but it is a bad marketing move: Sorry iamded, I know it\'s your birthday, but......VROOM! Now for the second part of the build and my favourite, the front of the truck: Annoyingly enough, this part opens up to shoot a pointless rubber projectile: To do this, you open the roof (a nice detail btw) and pull back the mechanism, here: Thus blowing the front part open and launching it.....well, not far really The wheels and covers are pretty cool, and the front is nicely designed, the red looks good and the rear vision mirrors are a great touch. And now for the most disappointing part - step three, the trailer: (Note - Clicky joint piece not part of set, just used to hold it up!) That\'s right, almost the entire thing is open, even the "filled in" side has holes! I\'d certainly be cared to be back there, one bumpy hill and back you go! I didn\'t put the lame computer stickers on, and the control area is pretty lame in general. Not to mention Taejo (who is depicted on the boxart as standing at the desk, would most likely just be sucked out the back at those speeds! There are some pluses too though, like the ridiculously awesome minifig paintings I\'ll be using for Wayne Manor. Also note the "control" on Cruncher\'s desk that when turned, turns the gun at the bottom. It\'s an alright feature: Here is an example, I\'ve shot iamded on his birthday. What? It\'s a love ray! Haven\'t you seen the Care Bears? And though I\'m not a massive fan of stickers, this is just too cool. The little aquarium is very simple but very clever, using a printed piece between two clear windows to create the illusion of a tank: It looks much better in real life, trust me, and here is a side view to better explain: Now, to connect the two is a good thing, I like the way a simple technic piece assumes the job. Oh, and behold my hand! The completed truck, which, while a mixed bag, still doesn\'t look too bad (I guess): Now the completed set, which, despite its unbelievable large flaws, still looks cool. (Warning, the kickass iamded and Batbrick figures do not come with this set): More pics here: http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=3147324 All in all: Minifigs: 5/5 - Racer X is beautiful, Cruncher Block and the Driver too, and Taejo has a ripped shirt, damn! Design: 2/5 - Pretty poor considering the best part is available in a cheaper set, and only the front part of the truck looks cool, but still not truly awful. Build: 3/5 - Despite having a bad trailer, it was a fun build and sometimes you need something that doesn\'t take ages to make. Price: 2/5 - Overpriced easily, but Rogue Shadow is worse! Fun: 3/5 - The mere concept of such an open truck kept me playing with this baby for hours! Total: 15/25, not as bad as it would seem. Overall I\'m really glad I bought it as the minifigs are fantastic and the paintings and fish tank are cool. It\'s fun, stupid and downright ridiculous, but while not a great set by any means, certainly isn\'t as bad in the brick as it looks in photos. Until next time, Batbrick Away!

I don't see any appeal at all really in this set, but that's okay, as I want to stick to Castle anyway. The car is the best part IMO, which you can get in a different set with another cool car and for a cheaper price. But the main downfall to this set is the fact that the truck's trailer is half blown up and the survivors are magically staying inside and not being sucked right out of there, as you have mentioned. I would have thought TLC would at least included some sort of cover that you could take on and off easily (kind of like the modular buildings). Having said all that though, the front of the truck does look incredibly cool, and those minifigs are sweet. Too bad they all have flesh tone printed on them.

I was originally skepitcal about the driver figure\xe2\x80\x94I like the head, but I was trying to figure out why they put in a female minifig with no hairpiece. After having seen the movie, I now understand why; Cruncher\'s driver is a fairly manly looking woman, and most of the LEGO hairpeices would make the minifig look too girly for the character. :) Now that I know why Taejo\'s shirt is ripped up I don\'t mind the bits of fleshie color that are printed on it, but I do wish they would make some of the new torsos a little more head-colour agnostic...there\'s no real reason why Cruncher and his driver couldn\'t have had ties that came all the way up to their necks instead of having those little wedges of flesh showing through loose collars. Yeah, they are low-level mafioso type scum, but they aren\'t complete slobs.

I didn\'t get the smaller set with this car, so I\'m still happy, but it is a bad marketing move: I think the error they made was in the smaller set though. In the movie, the only time we see Cruncher\'s semi is when he\'s being chased by Racer X. Racer X and Taejo do end up on the same team for a cross country rally race (along with Speed of course), so I guess that\'s where they were going by putting those two together in the smaller set, but it would have been much more interesting for them to have made up a set with Taejo and one of the cars from the very goofy, comic book-gimmicky teams they are racing against. Especially since one of the teams (that is chasing Taejo specifically) is a bunch of Army-wannabee loonies\xe2\x80\x94I\'m sure more people would have loved some sort of dark/sand green racer with one of the IJ Soviets at the wheel than another Racer X. To summarize: Two Racer X\'s is bad, but it is the smaller set that should have been changed (imho). Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: Annoyingly enough, this part opens up to shoot a pointless rubber projectile: Thus blowing the front part open and launching it.....well, not far really As much as I normally don\'t like the stupid techic launcher thing, and would rather not see it in a set ever again (although one of these days I will make a giant multi-launcer rig out of them just for fun), at least there is a reason for it to be in this set, as Cruncher\'s semi has a missile launcher in the front end of it in the movie. I think you\'re supposed to lift the panel that hides the missile before launching it, similar to the way that panels slide out of the way on the semi cab to allow for firing in the movie. Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: And now for the most disappointing part - step three, the trailer: That\'s right, almost the entire thing is open, even the "filled in" side has holes! I\'d certainly be cared to be back there, one bumpy hill and back you go I\'m gonna chock this up to the standard LEGO philosophy of "playset" rather than "model" design for a lot of things. The semi rig and Raver X\'s car are the models, the trailer is the playset. Seeing as how the trailer is Cruncher\'s mobile office (rather finely appointed with lots of paintings and his pirahna "babies" in their tank behind his desk), and the intent seems more or less to have a playest bit in order for kids to re-enact the scene from the movie, I\'m not going to give them too much grief over this. They tried to capture the basic bits of the movie set (which we see mostly from the inside during the movie) and translate it into a playset type environment. That being said, I do wish the back walls were more solid, as I see no reason for there to be gaps in the back wall when the front wall (or the "fourth wall" as the case may be here) is already conspicously absent. Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: There are some pluses too though, like the ridiculously awesome minifig paintings I\'ll be using for Wayne Manor. Also note the "control" on Cruncher\'s desk that when turned, turns the gun at the bottom. It\'s an alright feature: Could have been a little better, but it\'s such a minor bit of this scene in the movie that I can see why they didn\'t spend too much time and effort on it. It would have been nice to have more paintings though, had the back wall been more complete (and I like your idea of how to use them :) ). Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: And though I\'m not a massive fan of stickers, this is just too cool. The little aquarium is very simple but very clever, using a printed piece between two clear windows to create the illusion of a tank: Definately a feature which is not showcased nearly well enough on the box art. Since it is one of the major features of this set in the movie, it\'s nice to see it translate rather well into brick. Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: Design: 2/5 - Pretty poor considering the best part is available in a cheaper set, and only the front part of the truck looks cool, but still not truly awful. That may be a bit harsh (but not much) given what I\'ve said further up this post, but it probably only deserves a 3 at best, so I\'m not realy going to quibble the point. :) I still think that Racer X should be exclusive to this set and a different car should be in the smaller set with Taejo, which would have improved the cachet for this set overall. Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: Price: 2/5 - Overpriced easily, but Rogue Shadow is worse! True...this should have ideally been about a $30 set (especially given the general awesomeness of the IJ Race for the Stolen Treasure set), unless they made the trailer a bit more detailed (better back wall, perhaps some drop down gun ports like in the movie) or at put least one (or more) of Cruncher\'s goons in the set, then maybe I could agree more with the msrp. On that note: if I remember correctly from my visit to my local TRU yesterday in search of the new IJ sets (since local Targets seem determined not to get them in stock yet), they had this set on sale for around $35 along with an offer for a coupon good for $7.50 towards the purchase of a ticket to the movie with any Speed Racer toy purchase over $25. I may be wrong on the sale price, but I know the ticket offer was there. So, if you haven\'t seen the movie yet, and are interested in this set, TRU may be the place to go right now to get both at a slightly cheaper price. Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: Fun: 4/5 - The mere concept of such an open truck kept me playing with this baby for hours! So you did enjoy the playest aspect of the trailer, even though you didn\'t care for the design...looks like they didn\'t do too badly then on what they wanted out of that bit. :) Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: Overall I\'m really glad I bought it as the minifigs are fantastic and the paintings and fish tank are cool.

The latest offering from our favorite building toy company is none other than the infamous General Grievous! No doubt you all know the story of Grievous; two parts Technic and one part human and his hatred of the Jedi. Follow along as we get a close-up view of the mighty General. No doubt the observant will wonder why I purchased this set from Shop @ Home instead of my trusty LEGO store in Glendale. Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s really as simple as two things: I\xe2\x80\x99ve been traveling a lot and didn\xe2\x80\x99t have time to drive to the store to get it AND gas is now $4/gallon and I would likely spend more in gas than the $9 shipping cost to get it to me. So there you have it. The Box: A gigantic box (much larger than expected) held the mighty General. We\xe2\x80\x99re back to the perforated tabs on the side and two stickers on the front that let the box lift open: Inside, we have 17 bags, two manuals and three stickers on a relatively small sticker sheet. The Manuals: The manuals are not terribly thick in fact the second manual is noticeably thinner than the first. They come in at 75 and 31pages. Interesting to note on the back we see the next (and more interesting) wave of sets later this summer. Nothing new to report on the manuals as they provide the LEGO standard of high quality and features we expect. - Piece callouts - Models divided into sections - Large images - Page numbers Since there were links posted to the .pdf files of the instructions online, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you can all get an idea of the manual and the parts inventory. However, for those of you without access to the Internet here are photos of the parts inventory pages: Random manual image: Features page: The Pieces: The short answer is you get lots and lots of little pieces in white, gray and black plus some big pieces in white, gray and black. Mixed in the set is a fair amount of oddball pieces like minifig tools, Jedi hood and trans yellow dome. Fear not, despite the eclectic collection of parts, it all comes together in the end (not unlike a typical day at work for me\xe2\x80\xa6) It is probably worth noting again that there is a heavy amount of Technic parts and pieces here. The Build: The build starts off with a rather in-depth build of the stand in which General Grievous stands on. Once you think you are done, you keep adding on to this (rather solid) base. I bet there are 250 pieces just in the base alone! It is quite nice when you get done with it though and really adds to the display. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad LEGO didn\xe2\x80\x99t skimp on the base as it completes the model. Once you get through all that, the rest of the build is a real thumb-bruiser. Anyone who has built a decent size Technic set knows the feeling of your thumbs being sore when you are done. You get the same effect here. It is actually a fun build and I really liked seeing how the designers used all the various pieces to recreate a fairly accurate model of Grievous. The model is built from the ground up as seen in a few of the progress shots: Here is what is left over: The Design: The design is quite good and is very accurate. Some might be disappointed that since this is a Technic set we don\xe2\x80\x99t have more articulation in the shoulders and have the ability to separate two arms into four as seen in the movie. However, it would seem the real intent is for display and not functionality. Here is a shot of the torso and the detail involved: Here are Grievous\xe2\x80\x99 organs: Careful observers will note that my model is lacking two \xe2\x80\x9carrow\xe2\x80\x9d stickers from the two white chest pieces. I failed to see these on the sticker sheet and only grabbed the large Grievous sticker. So, note that there are actually THREE stickers and not ONE. Chest protector and respirator: Head and arms: I was a little disappointed that we got two yellow blades and no green blades on the lightsabers. Note how all the lightsabers have different hilts which is a nice touch: Here are some shots of the completed model with a few other sets shown for scale. He is actually pretty tall: You have the option to remove the top two arms and put in shoulder plates if you so desire: Detail on the back: Overall Thoughts: I\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying for a few years that we should have a Technic Grievous set and we finally got one. Designed more as a model and not a fully functional swooshable figure, Grievous is a tad flimsy. You won\xe2\x80\x99t want him to veer too far off his massive and sturdy base. It would have been nice to have is cape with him (like the Technic Vader set). I do like the size of the model and it is impressive to look at. LEGO Star Wars System fans will likely want to think twice before purchasing but Technic and UCS fans should be satisfied. Final Rating: 75% Build 8/10 (Very Good \xe2\x80\x93 Fun, relatively quick build. Technic fans will be more pleased than others.) Design 8/10 (Very Good \xe2\x80\x93 Some nice SNOT and Technic techniques. A bit flimsy but the base is kind of cool.) Parts 7/10 (A mixed bag of stuff. Probably can\xe2\x80\x99t get too many diverse builds from this except for other robot type models.)

Guess what happened today? When walked into my Toys \'R\' Us in Fullerton, CA, just to buy a simple Tiny Turbo racer, what do I see? All the Agents sets sitting on the shelf, ready for the taking! I didn\'t have too much money with me, so I just got 2 of 8631 Mission 1: Jetpack Pursuit! It\'s a really cool little set, so I thought I\'d review this puppy for you! I shall proceed in the order of the instructions. So, let\'s get started! The Minifigs Let\'s begin with the minifigs, Saw Fist and Agent Chase! They are really cool, some of the coolest minifigs I have seen in a while! I took off Saw Fist\'s wig & chainsaw so you can see his head and cybernetic arm better! Here is a back view of Saw Fist, and - SURPRISE! Agent Chase has a double sided head! One side with his cool "mission face" with sunglasses and headset, and one with his casual Bruce Wayne type face (note, though, that it is not really the Bruce Wayne face). His wig, btw, is Mutt\'s hairpiece in black! Very neat! Poor Saw Fist seems to be forced to always drag his chainsaw around for it is way too long to just hang down from his shoulder like a normal arm. The Snowmobile Next up, we have the snowmobile, a sleek little vehicle with only minor design flaws! The container with the jewel is attached to the vehicle by a single stud, so it doesn\'t fall off, but is easy to pick up! In the pic below you can see the only two tiny design flaws: Thanks to the exhaust pipes, the laser cannon (or whatever it\'s supposed to be) can\'t be lowered any further than this. Also, the corners of that slope-ish piece that the handle bar rests on are sticking out a little at the sides. Other than that, it\'s pretty well done! The Jetpack Finally, there is the Jetpack! IMO, a name like Autogyro-pack or something would make more sense, but whatever. Although a little bulky, the Jetpack is very well designed! The rotor can be tilted back, and at the lower back of the Jetpack, there is hook with which you can grab the container with the jewel from the snowmobile. What I like best about the Jetpack is that although it is attached to the minifig in kinda the same way as that of the Riddler, this one doesn\'t rotate around. So, the Agent is being held in place steadily! "See ya later, chainsaw-cyborg-dude!" Stickers This set comes with a surprisingly large sticker sheet. The reason is that half of it are extra stickers! There are two large Agents logos and one Inferno logo - perfect for Agents MOCs! There are also a star and a small, round sticker portraying the number of the mission. The star seems to be part of some kind of game where you collect the stars from all sets on an Agents ID that you get from the Mission 5 set. I don\'t know, though, if you get any gain from this except for becoming a full-status Lego Agent! Below, you can find the list of parts from this set! Click here for a better quality pic! That\'s pretty much it! I hope you liked this review and will run straight to your next toy store to get one or more of this set! This was my very first set review! So any questions, comments, or requests? Any more pics you want me to take? Would you like me to exchange the chainsaw with something else, or do you want me to try the Agent\'s new hairpiece out on another fig? If so, just tell me! See ya!

A big box with a helicopter, car, and gate in it. Seems like a winner, but how good is it really, and is it worth the cash? Let's start with the Minifigs. This set comes with a standard Inferno Henchman, Spy Clops, and Agent Chase. The Henchman is you basic LEGO criminal type with a gun and a jumpsuit, nothing real groundbreaking here. Spy Clops, on the other hand, is very cool for, technically, half of a Minifig. His head has a neat electronic goggle print and the rest of him is a torso mounted onto a set of six legs made from Exo-Force robot arms. The whole thing is really well done and neat as hell. Agent Chase (Turbo Car Chase! ) seems to have a standard agent body and a double-printed face with one side a sunglasses and headset print. The other face is a determined Agent look. The set also includes a laptop with Doctor Inferno wallpaper. The laptop is a new piece and works like the LEGO books that are in a lot of Harry Potter sets. Molding on the keyboard is really well done and the thing can be held by a Minifig along either corner, but not in the middle and not while closed. The gate in the set is nothing revolutionary by itself, and I sort of get the feeling that it was included to drive up the piece count and the set price point. That being said, there are some things to like here. For instance, the gate has four wheels of barbed wire attached to it. The barbed wire is new and makes me want to start building some World War I trench MOCs. The rest of the gate is fairly big and it has a handy ramp attached so that vehicles can roll through it easily. The main feature of the gate is a sound brick. It's much better then LEGO sound and light units of the past, when the gate is opened it depresses a button and an alert klaxon blares that sounds every bit like a prison-beak in progress. The triggering action works surprisingly well and it's pretty much for this feature alone that I'm not going to immediately break the gate back down and add it to my parts bin. The designers did make an effort to create more then just a fence though. A nice control panel connected to a big spotlight crowns the piece, and a pair of cameras watch the opening. It's really hard to mess up a LEGO helicopter, and this set is no exception. The Inferno Chopper is a nicely proportioned and well built machine. It looks properly menacing and has the uniform orange and black of other Inferno property. It's armed with a set of four Technic pegs cleverly used as guns on outriding mounts, as well as a pair of the newer-style flick-fire missiles. I personally don't care for flick-firing missiles, but these look decent enough and seem to stay put so I really can't complain about them. Along the fuselage are a pair of intake pieces that I've never seen before and I'm guessing are new. They're pretty well designed and will come in handy for MOCing down the road. The action feature of the aircraft is the wench system. This is very different then other LEGO wenches in that you build the entire mechanism and housing. You can then use it to raise Spy Clops up and down from the bottom of the chopper using the rotor. Now, this also keeps you from sitting there and just giving the rotor repeated spins to simulate flight. I'm not too thrilled with that, but there are a hundred other LEGO helicopters out there with fully rotating rotors, so I guess I can let it by just this once. As you'd suspect, the bottom of the cockpit is completely open, which makes this a vehicle pretty much solely for Spy Clops (Sorry Henchman). But there is plenty of room beneath the body to attach a plate with some seats on it to accommodate another pilot without drastically altering the design, or even removing existing pieces. The Turbo Car is a slick little honey of a LEGO car, and the silver pieces that make up the body work contribute a lot to that fact. The front license plate appears to be an Exo-Fore code brick. But it also hides the activation lever for the passenger ejector seat. The seat works about as well as the Spruce Goose, which is to say not well at all, but here it's the thought that counts. The interior of the car is really well done. There's even a radar screen for keeping track of pesky helicopters. But the Bond-like features don't end there. A lever in the compartment raises pair of guns in the hood and a knob on the rear deploys a quad rocket system with more flick-fire missiles. This is a car that won't be stopped easily! The rear has two cones sticking out. I'd like to think they're smoke nozzles or oil-slick sprayers. All-in-all, this is a really good set. The car is pure LEGO vehicle love and looks fantastic. The silver pieces are very nice and it's a shame LEGO doesn't use metallic colors in System sets more often. There are, however, a LOT of sticker for this set and I know how much that bugs a lot of people. I personally like how much detail the stickers add to these sets and don't mind them so much. The set also comes with an Agents ID card for Chase which you can put little star stickers on from other sets as you get them. It's printed on a real nice piece of sturdy plastiboard and would be cooler if you could put your own picture and name on it instead of pretending to be Chase.

This time, I will be reviewing Skeleton Battlepack, and I hope everyone of you do enjoy viewing it. This was a request that put up by hollisbrick in the Castle thread. Initally, I thought it was a very simple set to do a review. However, for the love of Castle, I decided to whip this up for every Castle fan out there. This is an image of how the Skeleton Battlepacks look like. I have bought 12 last packs of these in total so far but none of the Crown battlepacks yet. There were snapped much faster, that I imagined. Do pardon me for the poor lightning. Today is a bad weather, it\'s hard to get natural light. The Skeleton Gang For a single battlepack like this, with an attractive reasonable price. You obtained a series of 5 skeleton mini-figs with tons and tons of useful castle accessories. To me, it\'s a very very great buy, and it\'s a MUST to stock up for my army building! Some add-ons! However, I was not very satisfied with my Skeleton armies standards. Therefore, I decided to make some slight modifications with some additional castle accessories that is stocked in my Castle warehouse. After the makeover, Ok, this is what I called a real skeleton army. This is mainly my opnion and it have to be aligned with my standards. I felt this improved battlepack gives a punch to the exisitng battlepack. The two soliders on the right, is able to align with the rest of my Castle Chess sets armies. While the one on the left, it gives me a great archer back up with the quiver and helmet attached to him. The ones, on the center especially the armored guard which equipped with the black nose cone helmet is my fave. It is able to illustrate the "Elite" among the rest of the guards with its armor and helmet which was featured in my Castle Deep Forest Expansion MOC.. Promotion On! In addition, the one which was hastly done with a modify mace, it looks rather simple. In time to come, I will change it and gives a better equipment and look. These are the remains. I can use the axe for my dwarf in my dwarf mine defender. In that set, there is no weapon for my dwarf and I have to get it from other sets. The rest of the accessories, makes a very good stock up for future upgrading! Overall: 9/10 This is not a playset. It is mainly bought for its abilty to mass recurit any armies, and is a main love for all Castle Army builders such as me! This set mainly have no major faults, and I love it so much. Although, I have done some slight modifciations, but this set is a must for me to buy more and more! Meanwhile, I will need to wait for the next shipment!

MacK, I can understand your concern when pricing is concerned. Pricing is always a big issue for us to determine whether to buy or not to buy a certain set in a particular country. Pricing varies differently across different countries such as US, Europe, Canada, Australia and etc. This is something very hard for us to decide on. We can't be sure why TLC placed their pricing strategies this way. Well, I think we should appericate what TLC is trying to do for us, by not using price as the only factor to judge whether to buy this set or not. At least, I am sure there are many of us trying to request for battlepacks to muster armies for their MOCs, Armies Collection and etc. Different people have different judgements towards different sets and different themes. I respect your opnion. IMO, let's don't let price be the only determined factor to decide whether to purchase a particular set or not. Instead, consider an array of factors that is offered. However, I do know that consumers like me and you are always affected by price. iamded, on May 26 2008, 01:40 PM, said: Thanks for the review Whitefang!

There are so many great stuffs waiting for you such as Dwarf Mine, Tower Raid and etc. However, I can understand that the problem of space is always the key issue.

For me, I will use these battlepack for army building purpose. I always feel that every kingdom needs a considerable amount of soldiers to defend their kingdom. Therefore, most of the time, the amount of soldiers will dictate how strong that kingdom is in my collection. In the future, I hope to build large castle scenes, combined all playsets, armies everything together and developed a kingdom scene. Of course, that is just a dream for now. I am still currently not able to afford much space and time to do such big scale project at the moment. Meanwhile, for this great castle theme, I am storing them at the moment and take it out when the time is ripe. One day soon, I hope I can post an image or two of my armies.

As you all know, Indiana Jones IV has just debuted, and TLG has released a set depicting the Incan temple (7627) from the film\'s climax. But Lego beat Harrison Ford, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and company to the punch by nine whole years with Johnny Thunder\'s adventures in the Amazon Ancient Ruins. The Vitals: Year of release: 1999 Parts Count: 453 MSRP: $80.00 The set included eight figures: (from left) Two skeletons, Dr. Lightning, Gail Storm, Gabarros, Achu, Johnny Thunder, and Se\xc3\xb1or Palomar. On the far right is my new sigfig, el Conde Voltio Villar. Construction begins with Dr. Lightning and his jeep. It\'s a sturdy Adventurers-style vehicle, with fatter tires at the rear for better traction. Next is Gabarros and his unusual boat. The hull is from Belleville/Paradisa sets, where it is usually pink or white. TLG ought to have put it in the Pirate theme, as it is a nice, intermediate size. In this set, it is a small steamship. The temple is built on modular 8x8 green bricks which fit into square holes in the baseplate. This is the "treasure room." This square has a nasty double-spear trap. Careful... This is the top section of the temple, crowned by Achu the (mummified?) Incan. More modular sections (these are from the front of the temple site, across the river from the main building). El Conde: "You are too beautiful a woman to be wandering alone in the jungle, Miss Storm. Please, allow me to accompany you." Gail Storm: "I\'m with Johnny, and I have a cutlass." El Conde: "I\'ll be on my way." Here\'s the finished temple, with all parts in place. Now for the traps... "Hmm, a giant ruby to bring home to the king." "\xc2\xa1Uf!" "That was embarassing. Miss Storm saw me fall..." "And now I\'ve fallen again!" "I had better rest here before something worse happens." "\xc2\xa1Chispas!" "That\'s it, I\'m leaving this place!" "Why me? Why?" The Verdict: This is a fine set, a set whose bare parts/price ratio does not accurately reflect the intricacy of its design nor the rarity of its parts. I had to buy replacements for some of them, and let me tell you, they are PRICEY! That green baseplate? $14. The little dark gray saucepan near the fire? Not available on Bricklink at any price. The brown boat hull? VHTF. With this set, parts quality trumps parts quantity. And the minifigures are wonderful! There\'s not a dud in the bunch with the possible exception of the very common Dr. Lightning, and even he is not bad. When you factor in the coherence of the color scheme and the brilliant traps, it is obvious that 5986 is a classic. 10/10 Edited by WhiteFang, 27 November 2008 - 05:33 AM.

Since it came out in 1999 I have only seen this set in a toystore one single time, one single copy as well... It was in the summer of 1999 in Belgium (Arlon) in a store called 'Maxi Toys' (Belgiums TRu, I think). They had the three biggest Junglesets for sale there: these Ancient Ruins, The set with the beautiful black boat and the zeppelin. Being into Adventurers at that time I had never seen the entire Jungle theme (not even in a leaflet or catalog) and surprised as I was I bought all three sets. That was one happy Dutch boy in Belgium! Surprisingly the two smallest sets made it in very small quantities to my local stores in Holland (except for the pontoon plane and small raft which was my very first Shop at Home order). The spider's secret I bought off BL, which makes me the proud owner of the entire Jungle Serie. Back to the set: This was the first time in a long history of collecting Lego that I had a deformed piece: an 2x8 red plate was twisted, I twisted it back and it still serves it's purpose... I loved the whole steam-idea in this Jungle serie: the two boats both (including the one in this set) had nice steamengines and a very cool mechanic (yours has the wrong hat/hair btw) to come along with them. The skeleton falling down on the end of a chain was the most intriguing part of this set for me, it worked really well and when you were done scaring minifigures you could winch it up again ready for the next go. The only thing I did not really like about this set was the difference in wheelsize on the car, front small, back large and the way the palmtree consisted out of just three parts...

The new 7738 Coast Guard Helicopter! itsmy first review, so go easy on me! lets start off with the small stuff. First the mini figs. You get 4 figs total. Two helicopter pilots, a diver and a civilan to rescue. The torso\'s are nothing new on the pilot and diver. Same ones as in the last coast guard line. But i like the colors alot better in this coast guard line than the previous generation. The yellow and blue really work well together and the coloring on the badge looks great! The civilian looks to be just a dock worker with an overall torso and a beenie. The diver has nice vented helmet and a pair of flippers that suits his duty perfect! Next we have an absolute work of lego art. The rescue raft! The orange flaps can be moved back for easy entry to the raft, as well as the white "support" beams with the caution tape. I put support in perenthaces cause they really don\'t support anything. Just there to fill in the gaps. At the top of the raft is a red locator beacon, ccommunications antenna, and a cargo loop for lifting the raft. lets move on to the interior of the raft. Not much here. But you can see the techinc beam that attaches to the top loop,and to the floor of the raft. So far this has proven to be very sturdy and has supported the full weight of the raft quite well. You can also see the white box that holds the equipment of the raft. Here you can see the life saver tube. Here\'s a shot with our dock worker peaking out the side. The raft says max ocupants 4, but with the storage box, that might be a tight fit. Now lets move on to the Helicopter! in my opinion this is one of the best helicopters TLC has come out with to date. I really felt they captured the look and proportions of a real Coast Guard helicopter. it uses a lower hull and tail section of the new airliner, and cargo airplane. It really seems to work well with this application. The engines have good detail using new "cheese graders" as vents, as well as the new engine stacks that come in the new speed racer sets. The rotors also appear to be new as well. lets move on to the cockpit. We have two seats for our pilots with a sticker sheet for intruments on a flat 4 wide plate. There\'s also an antena being used as a flight stick. Another shot with our pilots at the helm. Now lets moveon to the high lihgt of this heavy lifting machine. The med bay, and lifting winch. http://www.brickshel...icopter_020.jpg here you can see the winch arm at rest, along with the medical strechter. The bad part is that the med. strechter doesn\'t include the ussually included fold away wheels. here\'s a shot with the winch arm extened ready for rescue! In the second shot you can see the drum that the wire coils up in. It coils up via a recently new power functions "pull" back motor. To operate, just pull out the winch cable, hook on your load, and presse this orange button on the side... The bad part of the new power functions winch is that although its very smooth in its operation, its not very strong. It will only lift the raft a couple inches before it runs out of torque. It also has a tendency to want to pull the crane arm backin while its lifting. It doesn\'t matter if its a light load, or heavy load. The bay doors open on both sides for easy postioning of the figures and accses to the strechter. Here we have our diver looking over his rescue-e. Nice and roomy if you don\'t mind a crane arm being in your way!! At $39.99 and a peice count of 445, i felt this set was a great good considering what your getting.

The colour scheme is great, the shape is nice, it's got quite a bit of detail and I just have to get my hands on the cockpit window and those new rotor blades.

It really does look like the real deal. That the helicopter can't lift it really isn't an issue, because in real life they wouldn't lift the raft either. They'd use the rescue hoist to lift the occupants of the raft into the helicopter one by one (or perhaps in pairs). Imagine a storm with a helicopter hovering over tall waves with a big fat raft strung from a cable underneath it. The raft would catch a lot of wind and flop around quite a bit, causing it to loose all its occupants and also yanking the helicopter around, possibly causing the pilot to loose control and crash.

The MM Armored Drilling Unit has a more technic base giving it a less solid appearance and though I like the set, that jet that luanches from the back is horrible, partially because of the useless orange containment things. The Mega Core has a nifty crane instead of a big useless jet. -Tohst', u'0.917526', [(u'neg', u'0.00419567'), (u'neutral', u'0.0122282'), (u'pos', u'0.983576')]), ("Sinner, on May 28 2008, 02:35 PM, said: Care to explain why?

I want to preface my review by admitting that I\xe2\x80\x99m an unrepentant Harley Quinn fanboy. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been enamored with the character since she first appeared in Batman: The Animated Series back in the 90\xe2\x80\x99s, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve since followed her misadventures through her introduction into the regular Batman series during No Man\xe2\x80\x99s Land, into her own series, and even on the short-lived and not-so-good Birds of Prey TV show. So please excuse any pro-Harley bias. So, down to business. The 267 piece set retails for $30 US ($35 at Toys R Us) and builds up very fast and easy. It consists of Batman\xe2\x80\x99s Bat Cycle, Harley\xe2\x80\x99s Hammer Truck, and brand new Batman and Harley Quinn Minifigs. There is also no lack of weapons. In addition to the usual bag of Bat-accessories and guns, the set also comes with a pair of gray revolvers. Batman in this set has the new \xe2\x80\x9carmor\xe2\x80\x9d torso print and the hips are the same color as the legs, hinting that this is supposed to represent the movie style Batsuits more so then the traditional comic book \xe2\x80\x9cunderwear over tights\xe2\x80\x9d look. Harley Quinn is a very cool looking Minifig, and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t grinned so much at a new Batman character figure since my first Batman Minifig a couple years ago. The figure is very true to the character, and the torso has been accented with a few shape lines to try and distinguish her as a female despite the boxy body. Harley\xe2\x80\x99s jester cap is an interesting new piece. It seems (to me at least) to be made of a slightly different grade of plastic then we\xe2\x80\x99re used to. It\xe2\x80\x99s molded in red and painted with black and white, and it comes packed in its own separate little baggie. I expect that this piece may have cost LEGO a little more then usual to produce. Harley also has a buildable accessory, a giant mallet. Sure, she can\xe2\x80\x99t stand up all that well unless it\xe2\x80\x99s held in specific ways, but it\xe2\x80\x99s neat and most importantly, it\xe2\x80\x99s funny. It\xe2\x80\x99s especially fun for smacking the everloving crap out of other Minifigs with. The Bat Cycle is in bag number one and is a very fast build. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t some little Japanese sport bike like Nightwing\xe2\x80\x99s cycle. This monster is almost a car and seems to pack just the right amount of intimidation for the Caped Crusader to exploit. Thanks to the thick tires (two in front, one in back) it stands up just fine on its own and rolls very well. The huge exhaust pipes are a nice touch and give the thing a look of engine power. The only real flaw is the inclusion of the flick-fire missiles mounted on the sides. But, as with any LEGO model, they can be easily left out without hurting the look of the vehicle. The hammer truck is the bulk of this set and a lot more fun then it looks. Of the monster truck persuasion, the vehicle is designed and built with a surprising level of solidity. The axle mounts are particularly impressive. The big wheels and tires just beg you to drive this thing right over the Bat Cycle (or Batman). The mega-mallet gimmick is also a surprise. Not so much for its technical complexity, there isn\xe2\x80\x99t any really, but for the fact that once you start turning the knob at the rear to swing the mallet back and forth, it\xe2\x80\x99s really a lot of fun. There are some low points to the truck design. Again the flick-fire missiles are tacked on and there\xe2\x80\x99s a cargo crate/bed set into the back for Harley\xe2\x80\x99s loot of jewels. The crate would have looked a lot better molded in black. In brown it breaks up the look of the truck a little. Speaking of which, the look of the truck is very pleasing. The red and black Harley Quinn color scheme works really well on the vehicle. There are a few stickers here, and unfortunately, the diamond patterned ones are applied over multiple bricks. The rest, however, are great. Not only does she have an \xe2\x80\x9cI Love Joker\xe2\x80\x9d bumper sticker, but she has a Joker playing card taped to her dash, I guess serving as a picture of her beloved Puddin\xe2\x80\x99. There is also a sticker for activation of the hammer, which boldly shouts HIT ME! This is a fun set. A neat new Batman vehicle and a big truck with lots of playability. The Harley Minifig is a must-have for any Bat-Fan and, if you only get one of the Batman sets this year, I\xe2\x80\x99d recommend this one. The price versus piece-count on this set is a little bit of a deterrent though. This might not be the best set for collectors on a budget or people looking for something completely new and innovative, but anyone buying this for a child can rest assured that the kid will get your money\xe2\x80\x99s worth out of the set through its play value.

Somewhere along the line, I stopped caring about food and decided to browse the toy department to see what they had Lego-wise. Usually, they have jack squat, but on this particular day they had a lot of new sets. I impulsively picked this set up, along with Harley Quinn\'s Hammer Truck and the new little campsite from the Indy 4 line. I must say, when I first saw images of this set I wasn\'t exactly thrilled or anything. I mean, I didn\'t really see anything particularly special about it, but after purchasing it, I must admit that I would consider it a must buy for any Lego fan. But enough babbling about myself. Onward with the review (my first of an official set)! In this picture, you can see everything you get with the set. I thought the box-art was pretty nice looking. The manual, on the other hand, took somewhat of a beating within the box, a common problem with most more recent sets. I do have to say that I wish they would at least make some effort in fixing this. They could just make a little thin cardboard "folder" to minimize bending and tears. For Batman minifig collector\'s, the highlight of this set are the Robin and Penguin figs. Previously, you could only get them in the pricey Bat-Cave set, but this set provides a much cheaper alternative. One thing you will notice, however, is that Robin\'s hairpiece is a new mold, as it is actually a black version of Mutt\'s hair (from the Indy 4 line). Personally, I think it actually looks better than the hairpiece used on the older version of Robin. As the Batcave had before it, this set comes with some bricks to make two cute (but deadly) penguins. They help add more charm to an already charming set. When you\'re finished building, you\'ll end up with a nice little assortment of extra parts; 1 black "cheese slope," 3 1x1 tile (black, yellow and white), a revolver, a technic pin, and a 1x1 red round plate. Here\'s Robin\'s Scuba Jet. It\'s nice and sleek looking. Notable parts of interest would probably be the green turbine engines. My only complaint on this one would have to be the use of decals on the 2x2 round yellow tiles. For that type of a part, printing seems as though it would have been the best way to go. Now for, in my opinion, the best part of the set...the Penguin\'s sub. This set has more decals than Robin\'s Scuba Jet, but they seem more necessary in this case. I actually wanted to put the decal\'s on the sub, as I think the it looks great with them. Obviously, it looks like a penguin, but wow, does it ever do it with style! It has a lot of interactive features, the first of which I will mention, being the periscope which raises up and down. And for the collectors of parts in new colors, it has a few parts in medium orange?, such as 2x2 tile. Here\'s a shot of the bottom of the sub. Another nifty little feature is how you can lift the top off and fit the penguin inside. And there is enough room inside, so that you can firmly place top on again, and without interference to the movement of the periscope. Another little feature is the rear spring-loaded missile. You just tilt the small lever toward the front of the sub, and it fires. And the last small feature are the flick-missiles on each side. Overall, this is a great set with a lot to offer for a decent price. A lot of fans might view the only drawback to it as being the use of decals, but if you plan on keeping the kit together they make it look really fantastic. Buy it if you can.

Finally they've caught the notorious Dr Inferno and imprisoned him in their cavernous Mobile Command Center. But Dr Inferno won't go down without a fight! Can the Agents stop the evil Dr 'Disco' Inferno fleeing? Will Spy Clops laser gun burn through the door in time, or will Dr Inferno simply use the lovely Agent Trace's enormous ponytail as an escape ladder to freedom? More importantly, will there be a riot in the streets of Lego City as AFOLs go apopletic at the thought of a 12 wide truck roaring through their ordered town layouts? Stay tuned! Part 1: The Box, Instructions, Parts As the largest of the Agents sets (so far), the box is easily the biggest. Trainee agents, examine the following three pics and see if you notice anything odd. Box front: Box back: Box middle: Spot it? That's right. The printed cardboard which has supposed to be the bottom half of the fold out middle section is on the back, slicing the ultra-large set image which would form the foldout in half . The way the cardboard is printed as one piece before it's folded I think this would be very hard to do 'accidentally' so suspect a major stuff-up somewhere along the production line. I bought this set off bricklink so would be very interested if anyone in the States who has seen these boxes actually on the shelves can tell me if this is common or rare. Basically I want to know if I should be annoyed that the bricklink seller didn't list this in the set description, or are they all like this? The instructions come in 4 booklets. The parts list comes in at 5 pages, which is a lot even at half-size pages ! Large images of the parts inventory are in this folderwhen moderated for anyone interested. Here's also some cute Agents-type artwork at the end of one of the books. Instructions show piece call-outs and are divided into sections according to numbered bags. As you'd expect for a set with 1100+ parts, this baby comes with a lot of bags. It's a treasure trove of dark blue. As well as the obvious large slopes and wall panels which make up the body and the roof, there is a wealth of smaller navy blue pieces as well - small 1x1 bricks, 2x2 bricks, 1x1 plates, 2x2 tiles, heaps of 2x plates, some slopes, 22x cheese pieces... basically anyone wanting a lot of dark blue should think about this set. The roof panels alone, for example, could provide a dark blue sea for a modernised Pirate MOC. 2 DSSs (Dreaded Sticker Sheets). Quelle surprise - stickers! The grey parts of the stickers here are metallic silver ink, which is a nice touch. Actually, as sticker sheets go, they're not too bad. Fairly subtle for the most part and the navy blue actually matches the bricks themselves. However, after looking at the sticker sheets I thought I was missing something. What about the pieces used for the projection screens showing Dr Inferno and the sharks - why weren't they on the sticker sheets? There must be another one! Frantically I checked and rechecked the box and flipped through all the instruction manuals to find the elusive 3rd sheet. Where was it? Ten minutes later I noticed something which had honestly never occured to me - THERE WERE ACTUAL PRINTED PIECES IN THIS SET! So obvious and yet so unthinkable. It's horrifying how years and years of Exoforce and Speed Racer set releases can mentally condition people's thought processes. Tut tut, Lego. What have you reduced us to? Here they are, folks - ACTUAL PRINTED PIECES. (Yes, I do believe this news deserves the caps.) I also noticed this nifty modification of the usual 2x3 cupboard - you can now fit drawers in it! Very clever. This may have been around in Belville sets for years for all I know, but it's new to me. The drawers slide in and out very well and the top one sits on slight indentations in the middle of the cupboard. Part 2: The figs! Our trusty agents - Charge, Chase, Trace and Fuse. (High powered agents don't have time for names of more than one syllable - that's why the bad guys always lose ). Chase and Fuse have the Mutt hair in black and dark orange. The lovely Agent Trace has an exquisite new hairpiece in dark brown, perfect for 'Rapunzel' themed MOCs. As you can see, her ponytail is loooong. Makes it hard to sit down, the poor girl. I feel sorry for all these female figs with such intricate hairstyles that they can never relax in an ordinary Lego chair. However, at least she has two breasts unlike the recent Harley Quinn fig. Compensation indeed. Seriously though, it's great that there's a separate torso print for the female character and this attention to detail is typical of the set as a whole. Three of the agents have reversable heads - nice touch with the headsets and I like the ID cards on their pants. Obviously the agents security system is based on some kind of crotch measuring device. This would make sense considering the conspicuous bulges in the pants of Dr Inferno's men (see the other Agents set reviews.) The villains - Spy Clops, Dr Inferno, Gold Tooth. Dr Inferno's hair in all it's glory. This is a great piece, although the orange colouring is a little rough on the front. It's so 3D, it deserves a back and side view (and indeed EB thread) all of its own. As mentioned elsewhere, this is different plastic to the normal minifig hair, but it doesn't quite feel as soft as the Exo-force hair. It doesn't fall off as much, anyway. The figs get 10/10 from me. Awesome hairpieces in great colours for the Agents and a sleek navy blue/ neon green uniform. The villains' faces are great and they are all very distinctive. The attention to detail is outstanding and it's great to see a Lego in-house theme with characters as memorable and cool as figs from the licensed themes . Part 3: The build The build is divided into three stages - the small vehicles, the front of the truck, and the massive command center section. (a) Small vehicles First up, all the small vehicles. We have a small flyer, 2 buggies, jet ski, and a speed boat - all in glorious navy blue with little bits of silver detailing. Top view. These vehicles are all simple, small and well-designed. Probably the weakest is the flyer, only because the cockpit looks a little large. In fact, the small flyer is probably the weakest element of 8365 overall, which tells you how good the set itself is! In various threads here, this set has been heavily criticised for being way out of proportion. There's a reason for that, as we shall come to. However, the existence of these small sets should appease some people. With the new coast guard sets, for example, all of these save the flyer wouldn't look out of place on a City beach with a little modding. Here's an example - agents beach party! (Spongebob couldn't help but crash.) The villains only have one small vehicle, but they've been well-served in the smaller sets, and this one is a unique and clever design. I love the triangular shape and the simple but clever technique of making the arch slopes meet up around the propellers. It's sort of insectile in black and orange, and looks very different from the usual assortment of helicopters etc. (b) Truck front This thing is a beast! Seriously, look at it. It's chunky and mean looking. You don't want to mess with this baby. The build is really nice. Like a lot of Star Wars vehicles, it's all based on technic beams pinned together. Unlike a lot of Mars Mission sets, underneath isn't ALL technic beams with some plates slapped on like a facade. The majority is a lot of plates and bricks which all fit together solidly. You can see from the detailing of 'cheese grater' slopes and silver pieces on the front how effort has been made to give this vehicle a distinct feel different to other Lego sets. Sure, the silver slope mirrors might be a bit too much for some, but this baby is all about attitude. You can imagine it roaring down the road en route to Dr Inferno's diabolical lair! After all, these sets are 'Agents' sets - nobody said they were *secret* Agents (c ) Command center - whole assembly Here's a view of the whole thing assembled - inside and cool details to follow at the end. It's kind of hard to show here as it is extreeeeemely long. This is indeed a big set. The build for the trailer part of the command center is fun and very satisfying. Yes, there are large pieces but there is also a huge amount of detail. It is also solid as a rock. I remember being annoyed building the big Ferrari truck a few years ago - everytime you looked at it, an 8 x 16 plate fell off. The Mobile Command Center is solid - even with the hinged roof and special features, it is not delicate at all. Kudos to the designers, again as it is mainly a brick build rather than a technic one. I also like how the command center part connects to the cabin - it's not a special piece at all, just a technic axle going through two circle plates, but it works and it's solid. (Please note I've been selective about which stickers I've applied during the build.) Top view: The rear: Here's an example of why I like the build: (a) the designers have enough sense to put a ladder so a minifig can climb up to the interior when the command center is open (b) notice that although the ladder clips at the top, there is an *extra* clip there in the middle purely to hold it in place so it doesn't flap around and holds firm. I don't know if most designers would even think to put a ladder there let alone go the extra mile and put a mechanism to hold it in place. Pure class. Oh, and notice the greebly detail stuff to the right there too. The other side. This is probably the other weak part of the build - the bricky gaps at the top where the hinge to open the roof sits. It's a little gappy but the set is so big you don't really notice. (d) And now for the fun stuff - inside and neat details! OK, so we've built the thing. It's big. It's blue. The top of the trailer itself would make a good warehouse MOC for a harbour layout. But what about inside? Is it any good? What about all those small vehicles from the start of the review? Where do they go? Well, I'm glad you asked. Because the solution is superb. The small flyer folds slightly and slides into place here: Lift off the roof and you're away! The large buggy and the speedboat go under here: The jetski slides out of the rear here, attached to its own little platform: And the small buggy goes inside the main cabin. There's even a crane so you can lift it down. So now we know why this set is so large! To fit everything in! It's amazing that this functionality doesn't affect the aesthetics of the set as a whole. But we still haven't finished on the details. The front section has a very easy-to-swing-open roof section and missiles: There's also a command section underneath the bit where the flyer lifts out: And now for the interior. I have to say I really like this space. Not only is it packed with great stuff, there's also enough room for minifigs to move around. I hate bases where the figs only have about 2 studs to actually stand and walk. Aquabase Invasion is a nice set, for example, but the actual functional space inside the base is teensy. Claustrophobia! You know within a week they'd be fighting to toss each other out of the airlock. No such problems for these suave Agents, who have plenty of legroom *and* the ability to launch missiles from their ceiling. The whole of the interior: Zooming in: Moving from left to right. First off, the medicine cabinet. Looks like someone's been leaving secret mission dossiers lying around. The projector area for mission briefings. Dr Inferno recently changed his hair colour from purple to orange, it seems. Why are all these minifigs so obsessed with their hair? The projector folds down when the trailer is open. Push the button and the light glows on. Now Dr Inferno's hair is orange again! This is one of my favourite parts of the set. It works a charm. The batteries for these lightbricks can also be replaced - instructions are in the manual. Agent Charge considers shark-fin soup for dinner. Did I mention these projection panels are printed? The detail is very fine too. The tool section. Laptops sit in the middle compartment. You get some flippers, yellow scuba tank and various implements. I'm so impressed that the helmet is pearl silver with a different coloured visor too - there's so much variation in the parts in this set, you don't get the sense the designers are using the same thing over and over to save money. It all feels luxe and top-of-the-line, just like the Command Center itself. Two laptops - yay! The aforementioned rooftop missiles: The Dr Inferno cage. Nasty electric shocks! Bzzt! (You can see my reviewing skills are burning out now - sentences.... truncated...) Another example of detail - nowhere else in the set is a 1x1 transgreen tile used - they could have used a 1x1 trans green cheese wedge piece as there are others in the set, but they didn't. How does Dr I get out? Flick that lever on the right hand exterior and the door pops open. Spy Clops the loyal minion awaits his master on the other side. And there we have it. Take a bow, guys! There's a lot of spare parts. A suspicious amount of dark blue small slopes but I checked the instructions and didn't see anything missing. I have to say, I do like the new policy (since Speed Racer I think) of including these small slopes as extras. Part 4: Overall Rating If you've made it this far, you've got more stamina than Dr Inferno's army of cyborg animals themselves! As I said earlier, this set has drawn criticism for the size of the truck. However, large vehicles do exist - I grew up in a wheat farming area and as a kid the size of the lorries that thundered past carrying grain was probably intimidating to me as this monstrous espionage machine is to the good citizens of Lego City! On top of that, it *does* contain a plethora of 4-wide vehicles inside ! Criticism of this set on the basis of size to me also seems misguided as this is basically a playset - and it is a very good one to boot. As you can probably tell, I love it to pieces and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone, whether for parts or for play value. Check out the parts list in this folderwhen moderated and you can see just how many excellent pieces it contains. A light-up brick, a flood of navy blue, metallic silver bricks - we're spoiled. 8635 is also an enjoyable build, with fantastic figs and top-of-the-line detailing. In a year when I've found City a bit disappointing after the run of great sets in 2006-2007, the Agents line has been one of the surprise hits for me and I can't wait to see what the designers come up with next.

Space invaders, holograms, compulsory seat-belt wearing legislation, and the return of classic Space. Ok, we don't have a fully fledged classic space theme back yet, but if 7645 is the way of the future, I think Lego is ready to do it properly. I wasn't a huge fan of last year's Mars Mission sets and only picked up a few on clearance, but this set is light years (excuse the pun) ahead of 2007's offerings. This mining vehicle is solid, compact, and well-designed. It looks impressive, and even better, it has fantastic Power Functions operability! Behold 7645 - MT-61 Crystal Reaper! (PS I wasn't joking about the holograms or seat belts.) Part 1: Box, Instructions, DSSs (Dreaded Sticker Sheets), Parts Front of box: Back of box: 2 x instruction booklets: DSS numero uno - for the Reaper DSS number two - apologies for the blurry pic but I wanted to capture the sweet shimmy of the metallic holographic background on this sheet The way it catches the light really makes a difference to the small alien craft and makes it look much more interesting from the plain stickers of last year. There's heaps of spare silvery stuff once the stickers are applied for those who use the leftover sticker material for customising. Parts bags - 4 numbered with one extra with larger pieces Parts everywhere - woo! I know the Lego instruction books scold me if I mix bags, but I'm a devil-may-care kind of guy. In your face, TLC. I love mixing all the parts together before I build, it reminds me of my youth when the days were long, anything was possible, and I didn't need strict instructions not to build on grass or poke my eye out with a technic shooter. Interesting parts - these may or may not be new, my technic knowledge is not that detailed. The little scoop parts are so cute and have a heap of potential uses. I love 'em. They're like Smurf hats at Miniland scale. These technic wheel things in orange are also cute. They kind of remind me of marigolds. Giant Fabuland marigolds! The track pieces - you get 70 of these - here's the section of track for one side - as you can see it's about 52 studs long. These hold together better than the small ones on the Hailfire Droid/ Jungle Cutter. Part 2: Minifigs, small mining transport, alien ship I have to confess - I forgot to take an individual snap of the astronauts . It's the usual bunch though - Scaredy Face guy, Sunglasses in Space Man and a third one I can't remember. You don't really care, though? You're only interested in the alien commander and his matching arms/ legs combo deal. As brickbitz noted in his review of the smaller set, the glowy eye is just a 1x1 cylinder. The set also comes with 2 normal jellies - one pictured here for size. You'll see what happened to the other one soon enough... The alien craft is nothing exciting, apart from the gorgeous glinting stickers. Here's the road safety angle. The commander actually clips onto a 1x2 plate with handle so he can't fall out! Then the lime tentacle thing descends on top of him to keep him firmly there, like a baby seat. Not very brave for an alien commander, is he? I mean, did Darth Vader ever use a seatbelt? Tssk. With cradle up: This part of the build also includes the small astronaut mining buggy - small and effective. (Please note in this build I've applied stickers to everything bar cockpit pieces.) This comes with radio and saw piece. Part 3: The Reaper! The first part of the build is the detachable shuttle. I really like the retro aesthetic of this with the angled wings and the side hoverpod things. It is much better than the comparable vehicle from 7699. The new flickfire piece is a waste of space - it's fairly limp. I prefer the simple flickfire technic pin to be honest. There's also a very nice little side workshop as you can see. I really like how the control unit is 'plugged' into the wall via 5 1x1 round plates (third pic, it's a bit dark). Great detail. [The technic pins on the back are there to connect the Power Functions battery box. It's odd they're included at this stage of the instructions - maybe the intention was to release it originally with all the necessary motors etc but the price point was too high and they scaled it back] The base. The shuttle sits on that bley technic axle in the middle when the Reaper is fully assembled. The little vehicle scoots down the ramp at the rear, which folds up to hold it in place when the Reaper is in motion. You can see there's a crystal container here as well - another nice small detail which I found the 2007 sets lacked. There's also an alien here - thankfully not in those horrendous trans-orange tubes so prevalent last year. The complete assembly. Isn't it snug? It's just the right size too - not massive but large enough to be a serious mining vehicle. The ominous black treads contrast nicely with the white/ orange colour scheme of the vehicle itself. The trans detailing - blue for weapons, neon green for energy - is carried nicely through the whole set. The blades and the scoops whirl nicely as the machine trundles along. Top down view: Tread detail: Whirling blades of death! The buggy descends: Probably the most disturbing aspect of the whole set is this pic: The jelly has an orange pump plugged into its heart which is connected to an energy supply on the left hand side! This vehicle runs on alien jelly juice! Either that or it's milking the jelly in some equally disturbing fashion. How amoral is that! I know there's been debate about this - the jellys aren't innocent, they're evil energy crystal thieving maniacs etc - but I find it a bit odd that the humans respond by chaining the jelly up to the bowels of their mining vehcile and suck energy from its heart. People debate about violence in Lego as represented by realistic minifig weapons, but I think the moral lesson here is even worse - it's OK to exploit foreign life forms for our own gain if they treat us badly first! (Who-fans, I think the Ood should have a word with the jelly Commander ) That aside, this set is well-designed and fairly good value at $AUD79.95. It's definitely a notch above last year's Mars Mission sets overall, with improved detailing and more useful functions. The holo-stickers are fab and it's nice to have an alien commander, even if he is a bit bulky and his fingers are identical to his toes. However, if all these reasons by themselves weren't reason to recomend this set, the following is.... Part 4: Power Functions The best part of this set - and the reason I bought it, really - is the integration of Power Functions. Bizarrely this isn't mentioned at all on the box and I only found out about it from the instructions when they were posted on Eurobricks! (Instructions for book 2 which has the Power function stuff available here.) This is a great idea and hopefully we will see more new sets take this kind of approach (especially with the new Train sets). Luckily I got Monster Dino 4958 on sale for half price earlier this year so already had most of the necessary motors etc - the only one needed was an extra small one. What you need is listed in the instructions below with redirections to Shop @ Home to buy the motors. Note there's actually a mistake on this page. The 2 small motors you need are both 8883 not 8882 (which is the large XL motor). Way to confuse the kids there, Lego! Attaching them was a dream and only took a few minutes (In contrast to 4958 where it was almost impossible to remove motor elements without dismantling the model). Basically the back platform and some plates and orange slopes come off, you attach the motors, and then the smaller plates go back on. These parts are now left loose: Overall the look of the Reaper isn't badly effected as you're mainly viewing from the front anyway: Sadly I can't show you how it moves, you'll just have to trust me that it does ! The way it is steered is demonsrated in the instruction pages above. Basically each motor is controlled by a corresponding switch on the remote. Move them both forward to move forward, move one right to turn right, move both back to move back etc. It zips along! It's a speedy little thing! Personally I wouldn't want to be in it's path as it comes roaring down the Martian canyon! (My cat was scared as it was.) It is oodles of fun and definitely worth trying if you have the motors or can get them cheaply, and adds a whole new dimension to the 'play' aspect of 'playset'. It is also as I said very quick to switch between modded and non-modded Reaper in contrast to the more fiddly Dino creations. The only problem I had is that if it moves too fast, the weight of the battery box at the back tends to pull the whole thing back and it rears up. It does correct itself though. I only trialled this on carpet last night so it may behave differently on other surfaces - I will need to experiment! Part 5: Summation This is a great set made even better with the addition of Power Functions. At $AUD79.95 it's well-priced. Buy it! Buy the motors as well (K-Mart still has stock of 4958 at $89, wait for a 15% off sale)! You won't regret it. Buy 2 and make competing battle machines!

The description, you\'ll understand later. I ordered this off of S@H last tuesday, and oddly enough, it\'s listed on S@H as MX-81 Hypersonic Airplane... I\'d like to apologize for the random, horrible, faded pics. I took the review outside, and the clouds kept shifting, changing the lighting, and then I had to go inside because it started raining. It\'s been raining for a week. It\'s raining now, as I type this. So, I foolishly went outside to take pics. The front of the box. Not bad, as far as boxes go. It features a lift-up tab... ...which shows the various functions. Back of the box. Still not much to say... Two manuals. I think this is just right- Not too thick, but not too many manuals, either... Oddly enough, the box came with a little folded up piece of paper telling us not to mix the bags. It comes sorted into 4 bags, by the way. Minifigures The set features 3 normal MM figs, 1 normal jellie, and one of the new commanders. I really like this guy. He has a few issues, like his hands being stuck sideways, and still being hollow, but still a great improvement. He\'ll make a lovely addition to any Halloween MOC. Stickers The set comes with a fairly big DSS for the Spacecraft. Pretty normal, but I do like the dragon sticker. Then, suprises of suprises, a technicolor sticker sheet for the aliens! How cool is this, huh? The tops of the actual stickers are shiny, which is hard to see in the pic. Even the bottom is shiny! Who said stickers can\'t be cool? The mining craft The little guy is pretty cute, and well built. My only gripe is that there\'s nowhere to spin the drill! It seems so lifeless without a feature... The alien craft You\'d think a Commander would be important enough to have a seatbelt, rather than be stabbed with a clip and stuck on the ship like those other grunt aliens... I think this thing has some potential. Shiny stickers, different body shape. And when you look at those engines, this thing could be an alien Corvette! But then you look at the back. Pretty bare, no flares or anything. It\'s a cool little craft, but it just...lacks. The modules These things have some potential, as well. With some modding, they could be pretty cool. Unfortunetly, it\'s pretty boxy, there are no engines, and the wings are too small. The top is pretty nice, though. The greebles are all right. The controls, as usual, are a sticker. Pretty spacious, mind you. The cockpit doesn\'t stay flush with the body, though. The front plate underneath it can be easily replaced with a brick to fix that. ...I\'m not gonna comment on this. The main body Too bad. The \'labratory\' isn\'t much of a lab. A trans-red panel and some tray thing are all that compose the \'lab\'. I was expecting more, but true to form, this Mars Mission set has no impressive interior to speak of. There is a lot of space, though, so it shouldn\'t be hard to mod. Phew! The lab folds up like so. Pretty simple, and would allow access to the lab, if there was one. And then we have this thing. What is it? Defense laser? Communications array? Satellite T.V.? The modules connect like so (sorry, out of place...): Too bad the pins stick out... Various pics... As you can see, this thing has more of those bars than an AT&T commercial... (There, you understand the topic description now? ) The rear. It uses a white City plane wing for the...wings. When I first saw the prototype pics, I thought they slanted downwards... That would\'ve been really cool. Ah, now to the platform. From the position of the drill, I think this could be a really cool turret location when I MOD it to more military space. Back to the bars. If we had space monkeys, they\'d love this. This set has more bars than a jungle gym.( ) Here we see the button that drops the platform. Pretty clever, and it\'s not in the way. Best of all, it really works! Really well, actually. Good job, TLC. 2 more bars and a shooter mechanism. Jeeze, this is really setting itself up for a joke. A shooter mechanism walks into a bar... Never mind! Here we have the handle that allows you to pick it up safely. A good idea, but it\'s placed waaaay to far back, way off the center of balance. You have to hold on to it pretty well to keep it angled up, though it does stop your hands from getting in the way of the platform. Ah! The platform in action. This is really a neat little feature. Not only can the ship land in a reduced footprint, but it also prevents the nice white paint job from getting red dust all over it... It\'s centered pretty well, too, and you don\'t have to worry about knocking it over, just don\'t shove it back at all. Here we have the latch. When the button on top is pushed, this gets pulled inward... ...Which pulls out of this hole and allows it to swing neatly down. Good luck, and happy mining!! Again, sorry for the lack of in-progress review. I would\'ve liked to take pics of the mechanism and so on, but typical of the MM sets, you can\'t really take it apart. Well, this is really a nice set, which can hopefully be upgraded with a better lab with little difficulty. Some of my military mod plans include: -Strip the lab and install a command center -get rid of lots of bars. The thing has more bars than Alcatraz. -Install some turrets. This is a big command ship, so why all the forward-facing weapons? It\'ll need some AA defense... -mod the landing platform to be a troop dropper with installable AA turret. -mod the cockpit pods to be more aerodymic. So, that\'s all folks.

There\xc2\xb4re many more nice details too like that 'satelite t.v.' thingy and that cylinder with trans blue 2x2 dish for the knob or these cylinders with cones on that handle, and that Alien craft\xc2\xb4s pretty nice and detailed as well.

I'd try to find more positives about the set instead of kinda criticizing it after each picture. I personally think it looks freakin' awesome!. The size is very impresive and I nearly fell of my chair when I saw the first pics earlier this year. It's quite unlike anything I've ever seen from Lego. Algernon, on Jun 4 2008, 06:34 AM, said: I don't understand why there's so much negativity... this is actually my favorite of the new MM sets. The finished look is very sleek and not very gappy at all. The deployable landing pad is great, and it'll make it easy to put on a shelf without taking too much room. Lots of greebles... although I will concede that it's just begging to be modded. Still, though, I'm definitely buying this one. :) It has a really great look to it! Spacefan, on Jun 4 2008, 10:38 AM, said: I don't understand the negativity either, one man's treasure is another man's trash I suppose. That said, having grown up with Lego during the 80's this set has a certain nostalgia factor in its overall look and feel that harkens back to that earlier period in my life which I fondly remember. Aside from the Factory Star Justice set (elements of which I loathe), I expect the 7644 to be the closest thing to a Classic Space revival that we'll ever see again from the Lego Group, but I hope to be pleasantly suprised someday. Though I'm not living in the past, and do appreciate everything Lego is doing now and will do, and has done since. And, like you, I'm one who's definitely buying this set. No matter how few of us there may be. I'm sorry you guys thought I was being negative- I actually love the set. It brings a real feel of Classic Space to MM (No, I'm NOT talking in the third person. ). However, it does have its own small issues, which are nothing, really. I said that there's not much of a lab- but that's the beauty of lego. There's a lot of room in the ship, so it should be a piece of cake to mod to a bigger lab. Too many bars? I'll take them off. I really like the set, I just want to change it to suit my tastes. It looks beautiful- It will find a home among my other MM sets as a favorite. Iron Moose: Good question. It's about 17 inches wide, 11 inches tall (with ramp down), and 16 inches wide. As for the platform, it's pretty stable.

Starting with 5617 Alien Jet, I must say it is a small and quick build, the jellie, is made of hard plastic, which surprised me, as I had expected Jellies to be a soft plastic. The jet is mainly 2x4 plates, some swingy hinges, the "seatbelt" and a thing which I cannot seem to name My one gripe about it is that the Jelly cant see where he is flying, it looks better with a MF in it. There was a red 1x1 as a spare part. We move on to the 5616 Mini Robot, which is basically a "safe" brick, with binoculars, soem cheese slopes, little arms, and legs. The best part i must say was the metal detector and "safe" brick, as these seem to be quite rare in sets (By my knowlage anyway). The austronaut has a face, shown in Dr. Sinsters review. The set also comes with a pick-axe and lime green gem. Extra peices where a cheese slope, a green 1x1 and a white droid arm. That concludes these mini-reviews. I also will use this opportunity to show my photo setup. Both sets are reccomended, if you either need a army, or are just trying to get a variaty of figs like myself.

Firstly, I must emphasize that I am not a very big Harry Potter fan or owned many Harry Potter sets. For this review, I will be highlighting what is the beauty of this small little set, and the reasons to own multiple sets of it. Comments and critics are strongly welcomed. This set is featured in the Harry Potter movie, Prisoner of Azkaban. This set is orignally released in 2004, align with the Harry Potter's movie. This was actually one of the movie scene where Buckbeak the griffin is appeared in the movie. The group of students are supposed to be having up close and personal with him. However, Draco decided to disturb our lovely Buckbeak. Enough of this movie synopsis, I am sure fans of Harry Potter will know this better. Box art Featured mini-fig/creature Background scene The scene is a simple garden, which had a very good mixture of spare parts for your MOCs building. On its own, there is nothing outstanding about this set, except for the griffin. You can buy multiple sets for the griffin alone and for Draco mini-fig. Well, you don't need lots of Draco. But for Castle lovers, black cap are exceptionally useful, at least from my view. Now, I will point out the following why this sets is so great for other reasons. Hidden cover Note that, this is the only mechanism which you can find in this set. It looks rather simple but quite useful. There are some little things hide in it too. Greens, Foilage and Brown parts Needless to say much, it offer 3 foilage, a green plant, 3 brown slopes, 2 ideal bricks and 1x1 brown brick for building a tree. Great for jungle building, forest building and etc. I am sure there are many builders will look out for these. Interesting parts It comes with a wizard book, owl, 2 printed tiles with a spider and stone prints on it. The far right, seriously I don't find any good use for it. Can any EB members enlighten me on that gray thing on the right? Grey parts It comes with a good 10 x 4 green plate. Useful for adding as a platform. Some more grey slopes for your MOCs. There you have it, Draco encounter with Buckbeak comparing with Deep Forest Ambush As you may remembered recently, there was an impulse set competition. One of my entries, which is under the History theme. The Deep Forest Ambush was firstly inspired by this set, and made an improvement out of it. Look at the improved tree compared with the orignal. Summary review Playability: 4/10 (Not much to play with, except swooshing around the Griffin) Design: 5/10 (Too simple and its defintely not related with the movie scene) Parts: 10/10 (Great for parts, explained by the review. A great deal of green and brown parts) Price: 9/10 (An inexpensive set based on the 2004 pricing) Overall: 7/10 (A must have for all Harry Potter fans and collectors whom needs a great use of green and brown parts) Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine.

Yes, I\'m cranking out the reviews! The other day I picked up this gem for an okay sales price at Devonport, Tas, while searching for the new Batsets. I informed iamded of this as he is a Spidey-suckup ( ) and he informed me this was the only set he didn\'t have of the Wave 2 of this theme. So I ask you great EB members to please remind him of this when commenting! Here we go with the review of Doctopus\' lair: Anyway, unlike other reviews, this stars more people, the Batbrick-iamded-dragonator-Daisy review! (Daisy is the mouse that came in the set) First up re the figs, and I must say they are great. I love fleshies and these are excellent to expand my Batman world, plus having a Spiderman to beat up is good too Doctopus is great, though his tentacles are annoying to keep in order. Peter Parker is a nice addition, I love that torso. Eve though Harry Osborn was totally absent from this scene, I welcome him as he is a good fig also. Best of all is Mary Jane, fleshie females are hard to come by and I love that hair, my very first one! Oh, and even better is bley Daisy on the far right: Another fantastic thing is that by mixing MJ with Doctopus you get a far more deadly and real villain than anyone could\'ve forseen - The Hippy! Oh c\'mon, tell me that ain\'t cool? Anyhoo, here is a pic of Doctopus showing his might: Random fact: Did you know I influence both dragonator and iamded in their sigfigs? dragonator adapts his from my IA series while iamded added Mutt hair when I had him like that in a pic I posted. Now onto the box, sorry about the lighting. The art is good and the cartoon spidey in the corner may have beenthe inspiration for a similar style in the new Batsets: Back of the box. Again, sorry about the lighting and blur, it was gtting late and these were the last pics: Finally we get to the first part of the set: The catapult. Is that movie accurate or what? I love the part in SM2 when he uses his homemade genetic spider powered catapult to launch himself to the scene! Oh well, it does comes with a cool spider web an trans blue spider, so it gets some points: And it is really fun! I launched spidey several metres once, I don\'t think he ever recovered. Infact, he almost certainly webbed himself Slightly cooler extras are these two. This awesome little boat is great for city, as is the simple but nice bouy, Daisy approves: Naturally dragonator ruins everything when he found out the "dragon" that would be riding with him was our nickname for Daisy Now finally, the main attraction - Coctopus\' Dock. iamded and I threw dragonator in the water to see if he could swim. He er, couldn\'t One Sweeney todd later, we continue! The overall construction of the building is very good. I know a lot of people hated stickers and i hated applying these, but they do look spectacular and perfect for any City setting, like a bank, a Gotham Bank As iamded has already noted below me the black lifesavers a very cool as are the web piece and log pieces: The inside contains the neutron copperplate triple bypass humdrum holy hum 5000, which does does, see movie. Anyhoo, it is very cool, and includes a little control thingy on the yellow brick next to it. Unfortunately, the inside is plain but for that: The other side has no wall too which is a bit of a letdown really, but atleast it allows Daisy easy access. one gripe is those yellow 1x1 bricks, they serve no purpose and break up the colour scheme: Better shot of the thingy thing. I quite like it, the use of technic parts actually works, and the whole set is worth it for those purple flames and dishes alone It closes up pretty well too, unable to hit the dish which is a nice feature: Me and iamded liked it so much we threw a revived dragonator into it. Unfortunately it disagreed with him, but it was fun: Another shot of the dock. I like how they have gaps in the jetty, I know the movie version was pretty wack, and although the set isn\'t very faithful to it (looks more like a seaside library to be frank) it still is very nice. This is my first large blue baseplate too which is wonderful, though funny how the set only uses about half of it: The roof is a well designed and fun feature, it uses some technic connections to render it flexible of any degree, as you can see here by my opening of it: Better shot of the roof design, it can lie flat or at any angle. I might use the design myself in the future: As much as I love the building this feature bugs me, for in order for it to work this wall has to stick out, which not only looks ugly but makes you be able to see through the corners. Still, easily modded, and log pieces are fantastic for mocing. It also means that there are 7 windows all up for a good, sizeable building: By pulling out the piece in the center the walls both collapss sideways outwards, which is actually pretty fun and works everytime: Overall view of the set including characters: Now for the story that makes no sense....at all: Spiderman is dead after falling down the wall mechanism (see above): Only Daisy can save the day! For dragonator is being held by the evil Doctopus! And iamded and dragonator are too busy not caring! And Brainbox is too busy complaining that this goes against all Marvel continuity! Unfortunately Daisy is on a lunchbreak so tough luck dragonator: And Daisy goes on a search for fortune and glory: Okay, this is what I think of the set: Build: 3/5 - Fun, but those stickers ruin the experience somewhat, and if you don\'t apply them the instructions are a bit hard to follow. Playability: 4/5 - Great little gizmos and bits, not the kind that keep you going like with the 2007 Aquabase, but good fun still. Design: 4/5 - Not very movie faithful no, but still a great little building and a smart design for certain aspects. Minifigs: 5/5 - Great figs with all different faces and very useful bits. Price: 2/5 Far, FAR overpriced even on sale sadly Total: 18/25 - A good set that could\'ve been better with a few minor changes. Nothing wrong with it, but it doesn\'t really cross the line to greatness. That said, it has a lot going for it and definitely worth buying or atleast a look! Thanks for reading Batbrick Away!

Lego.com said: Rule the spaceways! The sleek V-wing fighter can adapt to any situation! Position the wings and flaps in attack mode to protect Palpatine\'s shuttle from enemies. Or position the wings in flight mode to survey the area for intruders! Either way, the V-wing is ready to strike for the Republic. Includes Clone pilot and R4 droid. Position wings in attack or flight mode! Sorry to all for the delay, since this was supposed to be done 3 days ago. Anyway, to get on with it... Quite a minimal amount of baggies for this set, as noticed. And the best thing is... no sticker sheet. Yippee!! :bounce: The completed v-wing. Though not really a complaint, it would be nice if the entire astromech body was provided instead of only the head dome. :p Of course, then it wouldn\'t be movie-accurate, since the Q7 series astro-mech is integrated with the starfighter. :lol: He\'s definitely well-painted for a simple mini-fig. Since even the back is painted too. I have to assumed this is the same mini-fig provided for 7259 ARC-170 Starfighter too, since I don\'t have that set. Anyway, this mini-fig is much more accurate for this v-wing since his suit is rated against vacuum, while those in the arc-170 aren\'t . :p One thing that\'s lacking is the instruments panel in the cockpit... it\'s totally non-existent here. I wonder what went wrong during the design stage. Personally... this is the second most anticipated set for 2006, the first being the tie interceptor, for me. One thing is that there\'s no known release of the V-wing starfighter by hasbro, nor the other well-known brands. The other thing is that being a star wars vehicle collector, I would really loved to see a replica toy of the V-wing. And the V-wing by the Lego Group does not disappoint... it\'s nearly movie-accurate, except for the cockpit transparisteel cover which could used some paint like the x-wing\'s. Also, there\'s a permanent landing gear that quite neat, since it allows you to land the craft on uniform surfaces. The s-foils on the other hand can be quite a pain to pose into flight position. Very difficult for the s-foils to remain symmetrical during play. The "swoosh-able" or play factor of this product is quite good... just check out the pics for yourself... :D *Crackle* General Skywalker, we have incoming! To conclude, the v-wing starfighter would make a much better companion to the Eta-2 Actis Interceptor (Jedi Starfighter), than the arc-170. Coz the arc-170 seems more like a long-range bomber to me, than a snub-fighter. :p And a final pic to show it at rest... Comments (For 2008) Just an updated pic to show my latest display on the clone wars Hmm... off the record, I do understand that sometimes, reviews by most tend to a certain set of guidelines like naming the set, and showing the boxed, and out of boxed pics, and of course, the grading portion. Regarding my review, I prefer not to grade any of the lego sets at all as far as possible, because to each, his/her own. My reasons to put up a review is not to belittle the efforts of TLG in coming out with these products nor to help them market them, but to show my appreciation and enjoyment of these products.

Lego.com said: Challenge the Rebels! Blasting out of Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi, the TIE Interceptor is the fastest fighter in the Imperial fleet! Open the cockpit canopy and fold down the instrument panel to put the TIE pilot inside and recreate your favorite classic Star Wars battles! Includes TIE fighter pilot! Cockpit opens and instrument panel folds down! It does seem to have more pieces than the average tie fighter, but this is actually cheaper than the 7263 TIE Fighter. Of course, there\'s no light-up feature in this set. :sweat: YesH!! Finally... A... Tie Interceptor!! This is probably the most anticipated for all set for all lego tie collectors worldwide, since the fighter, bomber, advanced, and even the Expanded Universe droid fighter had been released by the Lego Group. This set is near movie-accurate, since the bottom part of it ain\'t. :p The cockpit and pylons uses the same design as that of the tie advanced piloted by Darth Vader. Except for one minor change, that is the aft interior of the cockpit is strengthen this time. And this is indeed good news, since the older models had a problem of hard hinge and loose brick connection. There\'s no landing gear for this set, but it doesn\'t require it anyway. This tie interceptor balances perfectly on its wings. Standard instruments panel and, of course, standard imperial pilot. The "swoosh-able" or play factor of this set is definitely very high... Just take a look. :D *Camera view from own craft* *Camera view from Tie-Advanced* *Combat simulation of Endor\'s Battle from the archives* No bomber, since I started late in re-collecting. :p To conclude, for a typical lego fan, this set is a 60/40, 60 due to it\'s good design, and for a typical star wars fan, this is a must-get. The only flaw for this set is the same flaw for any lego set in SG, the price. :doh: Comment(Current in 2008) Being a starwars fan... no... being a typical toy collector, space is definitely a premium... so much so that I turned to lego starwars to sate my appetite for more starwars products when I already have no more display space. For the next few non-lego pictures, they are the crown of my starfighter collection in 1/18 scale. So just view them for fun, eh?

The box The back of the box shows the two alternate models you can build if the polybags rip. There are 3 cheese slopes and two 1x2 tiles that glow in the dark, where the tiles are exclusive for this set. The total parts count is high at 142, but there are no really big pieces among them. Inside the box you will find the building instructions, a sheet with some odd sticky labels (thrown away) and 3 polybags marked by the bag building difficulty. The models The lime colored car doesn't bring out anything new. We have seen racers built like that before, but it does contain some nice bricks for the collection. The police cruiser surprises with an interesting design along the sides as seen here. It is harder to build because of the greater level of details: The helicopter is without doubt the hardest vehicle to build in a bag. I can't finish it because it's larger than the bag. You can't put on the top blades nor the tail of the thing, so it beats the forklift from 7733 where the top bar is the new kind that doesn't completely fit. There is also instructions for the alternate models, but it requires the bags to be opened... The vehicles are pretty standard for the racers theme with the police car being the highlight of the set Conclusion I like the difficulty curve between bag 1 and 2, but the last bag should be labeled 1000000 instead of 3. It requires some inhuman skills to build that helicopter in the bag... ? Lime colored car: 3 - We have seen it before, but it has some nice pieces... and lime. Police Cruiser: 9 - It has a massive diffusers, rare parts and a high level of details. It is a shame LEGO relies so much on stickers. Helicopter: 6 - if you see it as a set for one fourth of the price of the cars, it is quite amazing, but you can't bag build it and I would personally prefer some more detail instead of the big size.

Here is my review for LEGO set 10178 Motorized walking AT-AT Because I live in the UK I got this set with 6 free duracell batteries which was great! (It's just twice as expensive as the US) Heres the basic set that is from the instructions. This is the cockpit but please note after I took this photo I realised it was slightly built wrong. Heres one of the feet in proportion to a minifig to give you a general size. This is Luke Skywalker swinging on a wire trying to destroy the AT-AT I really wish LEGO didn't make so many Luke's because I want differnt minifigs. It would also be nice for a thermal detonator piece. Underneath the AT-AT you can see the shaft that moves the back legs, the motor and squeezed in on the righ t the massive battery box. A load of cogs that move the legs. These are the included figures Snowtrooper, General Maximilian Veers, AT-AT Driver/Pilot or whatever you want to call him and Luke all whithout there wepons. please note Veers should have a dark stone snowtroooper torso with 4 red and blue badge things not 3. These are the figures with weapons I gave them and the included ones Snowtrooper has new style blaster, Veers has Standard light grey pistol like the ones from the old adventure sets, AT-AT driver has old style blaster which I call heavy Blaster and Luke has SHINY HANDLE blue Light Sabre . The Shiny blue light sabre was included with the set which is a bonus because i really dont like the grey ones. http://www.brickshel...sc00521.jpg.jpg This is the switch which is attached to the battery box on either side of the AT-AT underneath the lift up side panels. you push the forward to walk forward and backward to walk backwards simple eh . A front veiw with the the panels open. Here are the Drivers controls which are simply a cotrol panel and 2 exo-force robot hands which are joystick things seen in the film if you look closley. The almost useless carry handle. This is the weird back piece. Looking down the AT-AT from the back where you can see the the battery box and switch. Troops decending from ropes and cables and Vader leading the assult for this I hadnt got any more imp's so I used Clones Pilots. (I now have a whole load more snowtroopers) Solo and Chewie sabotaging. More troops to squash rebel scum huzahh! A very bad picture of everyone packed up inside. The size incomparison to its predecessor Overall I would give this set 9/10 because it should come with more snowtroopers or it could be and Endor version with loads of strormies and scout troopers. Aswell as this you can really sit any one down because of the battery box but I stilll find space to put all the shown figures on this review in the interior as you can see on the above image the chains and ropes are hanging down a bit. Tjis set is now limited to 5 per customer in the UK and now no longer comes with free batteries.

Me:"Goodbye" [pushes the incinerator button] Ph4tDuD3:"wut?! nooooooooooooooooooo..........." and on that note, let\'s start the reivew of the UCS DEATH STAR II. Now this is an older set (2005) and I\'ve only gotten around to buying it a short while ago. It took me around 2 evenings to build it and I must say that I am fairly impressed by this set. Time for a box pic: The Build: Since I started building this huge (small moon size) set at Morten\'s appartment, I wanted to keep as few polybags open at any given time as possible. With this set it is actually possible to have a minimum of bricks scattered over a table or two while building. Not sure why, but the division of bricks in the different polybags just work very well. And that is great with a set this size - 3441 bricks. The building of the set is divided into several "Build this times x". For example the upper and lower part of the "unshielded" DS are completely alike. This is difficult to see when looking at the model, but heaven when building it: And this is how they solved the problem of having the wings connected to the buttom of the Death Star - geniously done IMO: Note that in the first pic the "skeleton" is easily seen. "The skeleton" holds the X to which both the upper and lower part is "clicked" on with technic pins. Also there\'s a steering wheel (I\'m sure there\'s a pirate name for that ) like the one in the bottom, in the top of the model to hold the upside "wings". So after having build duplicate wings (upper and lower), the "belt" (all the way around the star) and the upper and lower part of the "unshielded" side, it was time to step back and watch the Death Star II in all it\'s glory: Such a great UCS set. Now I did have a few "huh\'s" during the build: HUH! #1 In the instruction the technic lesser-dragon-head should be dark grey, but I got it in light gray. Go figure and thank you replacement parts. I\'ve experienced this before and apparently TLG uses different colours when "out-of-stock". All one has to do is call them and ask for the right colour and it\'s on it\'s way Still a HUH! experience. HUH! #2 Again it appears that TLG changed the design of the technic axleholed 1x2 bricks. The bottom has changed and I got the set where it was mixed up between "old" and "new" version. Not that annoying, but still got me perplexed as to: "Am I doing this right?" Kinda stressing to consider taking most of the star apart to check the remaining 231 technic bricks 1x2 with axlehole. Now for a verdict: : 1: looks great 2: even my "wife" likes it - female appeal 3: it\'s a great build 4: the polybags work for you 5: it\'s Star Wars 6: the design is awesome : 1: it wobbles if you touch it 2: very small parts come off, if you touch it 3: parts come off when you try to move it somewhere safe 4: zero swooshability So in short (yes even shorter]: The DSII is a well designed UCS set that has a great design. Like most other UCS sets, it is not meant for play - hence don\'t play with it. UCS verdict (the numbers) 5/10 (design++/instructions+-/bricks+-/sturdiness--/colourscheme+-) design: awesome look and great greeble set instructions: easy to follow steps with bricks mentioned hard to see wether it\'s black or dark grey bricks: loads of great bricks a zillion bricks of the same type sturdiness: DON\'T TOUCH colouscheme: grey in grey with a little touch of black Need a missing instruction?

I agree with KimT in that the removal of the laser and Super Star Destroyer gives it more authenticity but to call it a gray golf ball or ignore its inherent accuracy is simply to miss the point. It proved to be the best build to share with someone, be it family or friend due, to its repeated sections and impressive finish. Its a clever build and to criticize it for lack of playability or (I suspect for many) its absence of minifigs is just absurd and possibly why Lego has not released a proper UCS in nearly two years.

Sadly for those who love these sculptural masterpieces we're stuck with simple toys with 'play features' and cute minifigs.

This is my first review, so contstructive critisism is very much appreciated! On to the review: First, we start out with the box: The box art is the same as always since 2006. nothing special. Then we start the build. The build is fairly easy, and will take the seasoned builder about 15-20 min to complete. Here is the finished model: and bird\'s eye view: As you can see, this ship is very sleek. The fins or "wings" each have an outer slope and an inner one, with the guns in between. There are also cones on the front of the fins, which give the ship an even more sleek look. In the middle of the wings there is the main body, with a big slope and stripes decorating it. This set has a very good playability factor, as I\'m about to show you now. The guns on the ship are pretty cool looking to begin with; a bley slope attaching a lightsaber hilt and a trans-neon green stud to the fin on each side. But theres more than what meets the eye: Yes, the guns flip up! ...and they can flip all the way back to hide them, for whatever case they need hiding. Lets have a look at the back, there is a tail fin used as landing gear and some lightspeed boosters: But wait... The tail fin can flip up for flight thanks to a hinge attached to the back of the cockpit. Heres another playability factor: The cockpit can slide open very smoothly and easily. Heres how this is possible: A clever system under the hood allows the cockpit to open. See those two bley pieces on the black ones? Those bley ones attach to the tan plates under the hood, and the hood and windsheild attach to the black peices. The black and bley pieces work together as a sliding system, so the cockpit opens. Viola! And then the cockpit snaps in place thanks to the red hook and clip. Its a very accurate system, and works very well. You\'ll want to open and close it over and over again! Now, finnaly to the fig: The General himself. A very impressive fig, with a new head and torso mold. In this set, (which is one of only two with Greivous in it) he comes with 2 green and two blue lightsabers, all with bley hilts ( ). I was hoping for chrome hilts, but its a minor fault. Grievous also comes with a new mold pistol blaster (not pictured). Heres the General in the cockpit (sadly a weak cockpit, no details): He just half lays down on a small slope. In this set, he doesnt come with a cape beacuse with it on, the cockpit doesnt close. Thats about it, heres the... FINAL VERDICT: Build: 7/10 Fairly easy but fun. A little bit weak. Playability: 8/10 Many playability factors, but some are boring or pointless. Swooshability: 8/10 very fun to fly around, sometimes pieces break off. Minifigs: 10/10 one amazing fig with 4 lightsabers and a new blaster. what more could you ask for? Design: 9/10 very sleek, but hardly any real texture. i like it, but others might want greebling. Price: 10/10 Overall Score: 9/10 A very cool ship with a very cool minifig and accessories. One of the best SW sets I have ever seen for its small price I highly recommend it to any kind of SW, LEGO, or SW LEGO fan. Hope you enjoyed my review, please leave feedback!

I bought this set earlier ago, and will like to share this comprehensive review with everyone of you. Name: Troll Warrior Theme: LEGO System / Castle Year: 2008 Pieces: 19 Minifigs: 1 An image of a 5618, Troll Warrior Let the march begin The mighty brave troll warrior, carrying a dangerous cart equipped with a "flick" fire missile. Marching into the lands of the Crown Kingdom. Crown Knights must be ready for this new troll addition. From what I see, this set has a very minimum piece count since it\'s an impulse set. There is no unique parts found in this set. However, this set has a couple of useful accessories, such as 2 spears and 2 wooden wheels and a grey mouse running around. This set is another alternative for Castle Army builders to buy multiple sets, to build a massive Troll armies. In addition, the flick missile really works. Use a little bit of force from your finger and flick it, the missile will fly. Well, it certainly does not impress me at all with such playing feature. Base of the cart Different angles There is one thing I dislike about this set. The wooden wheels are too big, and it is the same as the ones in the Crossbow attack. I prefer the smaller wheels that exist in old castle sets that produced smaller cart. Since this cart size is similar to the old cart size. The old wizard\'s cart is a very good example of the proposed wheel. Bits and Pieces Close-up on the warrior and the mouse Summary review Playability: 5.5/10 (The playability feature is not fanastic.) Design: 6.5/10 (Design is adequate. If the wheels is much smaller and the flicking thing disappear, the score will be much higher) Price: 8/10 (An inexpensive set to get a troll warrior and a mouse.) Overall: 6/10 (To conclude, this set is good only for army builders. A new range of millitary vehicle to be added. That\'s all) Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine.

Add a generic fig from your collection and you have two knights and the pieces from the rack can be easily used in MOCs. The pieces that make up the siege weapon in the Orc impulse are not as easy to use in other creations. I\'d rather have seen a "Orcish" weapons rack (different from the Knights rack, but like it, using basic elements) with a second helmet, another weapon, the Orc armor and a shield to put on it.

It is to clean the rubbish on the streets, after a New Year Countdown. It seemed the cleaning agency have a new equipment to use. It's not as big as the previous street sweeper machine. The cleaner will need to operate the equipment manually, by pushing it. Look at the mess After sorting out Look at the pieces offered. It's not a very complicated set, since it's an impulse set. There are some pretty useful parts lying around such as the broom, spade. However, I was quite surprised when I could not find the lid of the rubbish bin. I can't used this rubbish bin to place it around my town, without a lid on top of it. I believed it is not a norm, by not including the lid. Look at that bin Well, that rubbish bin seem to be containing his equipment in it, instead of the rubbish. The cleaner's face looks pretty sad. I think he wants to have a change of job. Front View I love that blue brush very much. Quite fun to play with, especially pushing the rubbish aside.

Name: Coast Guard Kayak Theme: LEGO System / Town / City Year: 2008 Pieces: 21 Minifigs: 1 An image of a 5621, Coast Guard Kayak Roll Roll, Roll your boat It seemed the coast guard has a kayak of his own, roaming in the sea, making sure that swimmers will be safe in the beach. Now, I am illustrating him as a life guard instead. This set is simply wonderful. Among the 4 new impulse sets, Coast Guard Kayak is the best looking set in my opnion. The kayak design is very simple but looks realistic . Furthermore, if you don't need it to be a coast guard kind of stuff. Use it as a leisure water spot instead down in the marina. I will think any LEGO citizen will love to have some water spot in their busy life. So come down here and wind down with this new sport. Bits and Pieces Kayak and the bouy The bouy is very useful to position it at the coast of your water to highlight the boundaries in the sea, and warning incoming ships or vessels. Oh, I did not make it tilted purposely. There is a white round base which allow it to tilt on both ends. Useful parts These parts are useful to add on in your city. Somehow, when I see that red cone, I can use it as a police stop, to inspect vehicles on the road or form a barricade with it. The bouy base shape is unique too. I like it very much. It is great to attached it by the side of the boat as a life bouy. The coast guard's life vest and helmet are very useful for water activites. The life vest was produced in past sets, and now it re-surfaced again. I am glad these vests made their way back. A look of him, without the life vest Summary review Playability: 7.5/10 (Fun to play with, especially the bouy when you see it moving up and down.) Design: 8.5/10 (Design is simple but straight to the point, especially the kayak design.) Price: 8/10 (An inexpensive set to get more coast guards and more kayaks.) Overall: 8.5/10 (A very good set to have in your LEGO town. The kayak is simply so lovely to me.) Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine.

Name: Crystal Hawk Theme: LEGO System / Mars Mission Year: 2008 Pieces: 26 Minifigs: 1 An image of a 5619, Crystal Hawk Alpha 3 in Sector 5, reporting to base Alpha 3, Crystal Hawk, reporting for duty, Sir! May I present Mars Mission, latest scout craft, code named "Crystal Hawk". This spacecraft looks very sleek and cool with its usual white and orange color combination. I am not a fan of Mars Mission, but these white mini-figs simply attracted me for it. In fact, I only owned its impulse sets, and none of its main sets. Nevertheless, this set has the "swoosh" factor. I was swooshing around in my home last night. Well, I am not swooshing it like KimT though. Am I seeing double? Haha, the answer is "No". It has double sided face. I combined the pictures, to illustrate the two facial expressions. Bits and Pieces Different angles Love the way how the wings bend upwards and downwards. The only thing I find it a little bit wierd for spacecraft. Normally, I thought joystick is the typical navigation controls for a spacecraft instead of a steering wheel? I am not complaining about a steering wheel in a spacecraft. To me, it\'s quite an uncommon sight. Anyway, the white steering wheel is an useful part for making vehicles MOCs. Summary review Playability: 8/10 (Fun to play with when you bend the wings up and down.) Design: 8.5/10 (Design is simple, but creates a sleek and cool look.) Price: 8/10 (An inexpensive set to get more scout craft and mars mission mini-figs) Overall: 8.5/10 (A very good set to have for any Mars Mission fans, and for collectors like me whom can\'t afford all Mars Mission sets, this set is a very great alternative.)

Lets start with a pic of the box, shall we? As you can see, its a Limited Edition set, meaning the fig and set could be worth a lot in the future. This set takes about 20 minuets for the seasoned builder. An overview of the Infiltrator (also know as the Scimitar): As seen in the picture, this ship is very sleek, with very few studs on top (SNOT= Studs Not On Top). Basically, Its the cockpit with two wings (with two "fins" on each wing), attached to the hull. Heres a side view of the Scimitar: Very cool- looking! It lands on two "feet" in the front while the cockpit rests on the ground. Rear view: The back. The outer cockpit is beautiful, a printed piece on the back (no dreaded sticker sheet! (DSS)) and a large printed disc on top: Heres a look at the middle: There is a flick-fire missile (trans-red cone attach to Technic pin) on the inner wing, a trans-red lightsaber blade in the back of the hull, and a trans-red lightsaber blade in between the fins on either side. All of those lightsaber blades may come in handy... Hey, look: the fins open from the wings!: The fins open due to double hinges on each fin. Unfortunately, you have to hold the ship up in order for the bottom fins to open. Now, lets have a look inside the cockpit: To open, you lift the back printed part, which is attached to the printed disc on top, which is attached to a hinge. It opens pretty smoothly, but is somewhat loose, so sometimes it closes on its own. Also, the disc isnt secured well enough to the door, and often breaks off, even with the smallest movement to it. Inside, there is an elevated control panel and two sliding pieces near the floor. This ship also comes with a small speeder bike: Its very cleverly built, and is a really neat addition. See that clear disc on the bottom? It fits perfectly into the sliding pieces in the cockpit: Hmm... whats this?: A hidden compartment! Now this was a very cool idea by TLG, a secret compartment found by taking off the top slope of the hull contains Darth Maul\'s weapons and tools which include: A (CHROME!) lightsaber hilt, a pair of electrobinouculars, and three probe droids. A closeup of a probe droid: Just a plain, black minifig head with a black lever on top. Finally, the fig: Darth Maul in the flesh plastic. A good fig altogether, with a black hood and lightsaber blades taken from the ship. He did come with a crisp, new black cape (packaged in a small, white cardboard box), but I am currently using it for another fig. Note that this is a limited edition fig, so stock up. A comparison pic of the two Mauls: The 2007 version is on the left, and the 1999 version on the right. Note a few key differences between the two: the new one has smaller red tattoos and a smoother torso. Also, the new one has bigger eyes and a more cartoony look. Maul on the speeder bike: Of course, he fits perfectly in the cockpit wile sitting on the bike, and he can reach the controls: Well, thats about it, here is the... FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, easy and fun, breaks every once in a while. Playability: 7/10, this set has many features, but is very fragile between the cockpit and hull and between the two cockpit pieces. Swooshability: 1/10, too fragile to fly around, plus the flick fire missiles fall out. Minifigs: 9/10, a great fig with a chrome hilt and a double sided blade. A little cartoony. Design: 7/10, very clever techniques, very sleek, but very fragile. Price: 8/10, fair enough, could be a few dollars cheaper. Overall Score: 6.5/10, a very sleek ship with clever building and play techniques, but very, very fragile, and shouldnt be picked up off of the shelf too often. And with that, my review is over, but all of yours are not: comments and thoughts very welcome!!

The set introduced/infused white and black bricks with classic blue space pieces. The result was this great classic vehicle.

I added a completely new forward-cab, close to the ground, for a ground--observer to monitor the terrain. I added even larger wheels, allowing this variant to truly be "all terrain", ...besides, what good is it having a combat vehicle if it gets stuck in the middle of a firefight? The 6927-W has a five man crew: a driver, a gunner who also serves as overall-commander, a terrain observer in the very front. In the lab are the weapons systems officer and computer/tech specialist. The All-Terrain Warrior vehicle portion is armed with lasers and blaster cannons, with options for other weapons. There are short-range nuclear rockets on the lab, guided by the rader control. The lab now has blast-proof shutters on the windows protecting the crew from rocket blast. Additional protection can be added to the lab, if-need-be, such as more extensive blast-shielding. All-in-all, the All-Terrain Warrior is a beast of a machine. Two 6927s can protect an entire convoy of standard 6927 or 6927-C.

Spongebob and injured Bob: The set comes with two litters. The ambulance car is a bit extraordinary. I don\xc2\xb4t know how the car is like in the show (and I saw a lot of episodes) but it looks a bit strange, mostly because the weehls are too small. Of course we get another SS (not so D this time). The litter fits in the back, with help of this lid. I wish it would be the hinge-lid from before 2004...

It's the first BELVILLE set that I've bought for her so it's a bit of an experiment. The house is 5 rooms and it's made up of mostly large pieces. There still is a decent amount of normal LEGO in it though. The doorways in the house align when it is opened out. Starting with the bathroom, included is a shower, toilet, sink with vanity and a baby potty. The mirror sticker is one of the few that I put on. The open plan lounge/kitchen/dining room is well appointed as well and it has a nice glass table and coffee machine. The kitchen chairs are Fabuland parts... and don't work really well. It seems they are having jellyfish for dinner! The clock is the only printed part in the set. Upstairs is a baby room and the master bedroom. The radio and the TV (not shown) were stickers to my disappointment. Up top is an extra room suitable for reading. (Those antenna things were made from spare parts by my daughter. I have no idea what they are supposed to be... ) There are some stickers that go on the back, but I didn't put them on. As it is the set looks OK this way, but since it is a dolls house it doesn't really matter. I do think though that the fireplace should have been given a back. The BBQ is made from normal parts and is quite effective. I think it uses the same light brick that's in the 4998 Stegosaurus set. My kids were using it as a torch before my grumbling ruined their fun... Like all BELVILLE sets, the highlight is arguably the accessories. I'll be borrowing a few of these from time to time... Here is the controversial baby catapult. As you can see, it works OK, but LEGO probably should have tried a bit harder. We also bought for her 7583 Playful Puppy. It also comes with some nice accessories, but not enough to justify buying unless you want the rest of the parts. Poor puppy; where does he sleep? Here is my daughter assembling it. She made me make the house though as she wanted to play a game we bought her. (Note the LEGO drink bottles! ) I didn't take any photos of the figures as they don't seem to be anything new, but I can if people want me to. At the time I was in bit of a hurry as I took these before bed so I wouldn't be stressed if the kids broke it the next day.

All through the review I was thinking 'This was a present - but who actually put it together?' so I'm glad the last pic cleared things up As for the set - it looks much bigger than I expected - I think it does make a good sized dollhouse. There are a stack of nice pieces in there - cupboards, oven, trans-blue 2x5 bricks, all the accessories, plants, flowers, food, the light-up brick, the pink roof slopes - but not enough to justify the $AUD129 retail price. Maybe on sale I'd pick it up and resell the Belville figs but David Jones hasn't even had a regular 20% off Lego sale for the whole of this year that I've seen. I think the Playful Puppy set is a horrendous ripoff for $AUD20 though. I agree with the baby catapult - the range is terrible. Lego just isn't trying any more, is it? At least they've moved on from throwing cats off three storey buildings. 2 questions though. 1) Was it a fun build? 2) Are those large figs anatomically correct under their frou-frou finery?

While at any store that sells LEGO (Target, Wal-Mart, TRU, etc.), you will notice that the clone battle packs on the shelf are way fewer in number than the droids battle pack. As you might guess, the clones are way more popular, and finding them gets harder and harder as the release date of this set goes farther into the past. So stock up! Alright, heres a pic of the box: A small box, as expected for inexpensive sets like these. Note the "Build your army" button on the front: TLG obviously is encouraging customers to buy multiples, and with good reason, which will be explained later in this review. Well, lets get straight to it: The contents of this set. You will notice a speeder bike, a gun turret, and some clones. Looking good so far! Lets have a look at the turret: An excellent Star Wars element to have around, especially for MOCing. It is very cleverly built, using a tire guard from CITY sets for the general shape of the turret mount. All you have to do is attach the (new mold! explained later) gun to the 2x1 plate with the center stud, and... Presto! I wonder how the clones build these turrets to fast in the middle of battle... A rear view: With a clone mounted: My only gripe about the turret is that you have to take off the gun in order for every clone to have a gun. Now, we move on to the vehicle of the set, the speeder bike: A rather sleek and good looking bike, with some useful pieces on it as well, such as the blue cones, the megaphones, and the engines. Some say it looks bare without the figs mounted on it, but I think it looks just fine. The commander drives while a trooper shoots on the back. A side view: And a rear view: My only gripe is the same as the turret: you have to remove the back gun for all the clones to have weapons while on foot. The back pistol attaches to a 2x2 round studded plate with a Technic hole in the middle. Finnaly, here are the new guns: This set comes with 1 new blaster rifle and three new pistols. It could have included one more rifle for the turret. And of course, the figs: Includes: 1 yellow commander (lovely fig), 1 Shocktrooper (comes with a pair of elctrobinouculars), and two regular troopers (so clean and white). The figs are excellent, all that any SW or LEGO fan should want. It could have maybe included one more regular trooper, but that might be pushing it. Thats all for now, folks, here is the... FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, extremely easy, should take the seasoned builder about 5 minutes to complete. A fun build, though. Playability: 5/10, I guess you can get this with the droid battle pack and make them battle, but this set has no real play features of its own. But it is good for collecting troops and using them for MOCs. Swooshability: 9/10, I guess you can zoom the speeder bike around... Minifigs: 10/10, four great figs that should be bought in multiples, a great army builder. Design: 10/10, a clever turret, an awesome speeder, and four great clones. What more do you need in a 10 dollar set? Price: 8/10, not bad I suppose, but if you calculate a dime for each piece, this set should come out to 5-6 dollars. But still, billions of these are being sold world-wide, and TLG is making a ton of money off of them. Overall score: 9.5/10, a truly memorable set, one that will be a favorite for ages to come, and very popular. A great army builder for a small price, plus vehicle and turret!

Year: 2007 Number of pieces: 102 Number of minifigs: 7 Price: 9.99 USD Brickset Hi everybody, and welcome to my fourth review on Eurobricks. Today, I will review the Droid Bttle Pack set. NOTE: This set originally came with four megaphone blasters for each battle droid, but I replaced them (along with the crooked arms) with the new blaster pistols and new twisted arms. A picture of the box: As it is on the shelves of major-retail stores. A small box, as expected for inexpensive sets like these. Note the "Build your army" button on the front: TLG obviously is encouraging customers to buy multiples, and with good reason, which will be explained later in this review. An overview of the set\'s content: You can see a droid carrying vehicle, a STAP, and some battle/ super battle droids. A look at the carrier: A light tank. Note the guns on the front: The guns and cockpit can turn a little bit left and right from the main body. Also, the guns can move up and down, free from the cockpit: And check out the cockpit: Two 2x1 center studded plates side by side for the pilot to stand on. Now, moving on to the STAP: A small, very useful vehicle in the SW universe. These are seen frequently in both the movies and games (as well as other multimedia). The design is very clever, using vertical building and a clear stand. Rear view: The guns/ handlebars can go this far back: And finally, the figs: The figs are very good, but very common. We havent seen SBDs in a while, and now instead of metallic blue, they are metallic dark grey. The worst part of this set is that the battle droids have the old arms and guns, while the droids in the MTT and clone pack (both of the same year as this) have the new ones. I wonder why TLG decided to do that... again, This set originally came with four megaphone blasters for each battle droid, but I replaced them (along with the crooked arms) with the new blaster pistols and new twisted arms. So thats about it, heres the... FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, very easy, should take the seasoned builder about 5-10 minutes. Playability: 6/10, has a few play feature, but nothing exciting. Is good for MOCs and army building. Swooshability: 8/10, I suppose you could fly around the STAP... Minifigs: 7/10, the battle droids are good, but very common, and the dont come with new arms or guns. The SBDs are very nice, and in a new color. All figs are great for army building. Design: 8/10, the STAP was clever, but the carrier was a little bulky. Price: 10/10, as fair as it gets. Overall: 7.5/10, the figs are great to have and make MOCs and armies, and the vehicles are pretty cool (the carrier is a little lame). The main problem with this set is that the BDs dont get the new guns or arms, so they dont fit in with all the new sets. Also, droids arent as cool as clones. But the price is very fair. And now, my review has ended. Unfortunately, I believe this will be my last review for a long time for two reasons: one, the remaining sets that arent done (according to KimT\'s index) I either don\'t have or are broken or have missing pieces. and two, my budget is low right now, and I wont be able to get the Clone Wars sets right when they are released, so someone will probably beat me to reviewing them.
