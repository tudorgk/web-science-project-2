306 Lunar Landing Plates Year Released: 1979 Piece Count: 2 Minifigs: 0 List Price: unknown As part of the Classic Space Collection, Lego offered two sets of moon plates. One was a set of two crater plates, and the other, this very useful Landing Plate set. Not much to review, but worth sharing a few images: The landing plate: And T-Plate: The two plates connect to form this very nice Classic Space landing platform: Set 497, Galaxy Explorer included the landing platform, but the one that I had was lighter in color than the one contained in this set (at least the yellow circle). Future Lego space sets could benefit by having similar road plates. Share your thoughts.
