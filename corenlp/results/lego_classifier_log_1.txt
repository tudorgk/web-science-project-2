A Troll driven by a turkey leg, what a wonderful little detail!!! :-D :-D Thanks for the review Vader. Very clever, using a flag to hide that crazy firing device. I find it rather odd they used blue pins for this. Black or gray would've been alot more discrete. About the big trolls, I think using different colours is good. I don't think a troll force would be very organized, so different colours would make the effect complete *y* . As for your troops, looks quite fearsome! Definitely compared to my pathetic number of soldiers.. :-$ A nice set, but I would rather get the Attack on Tower though.. no matter about the price difference.

Especially since the Orcs are sand green as well, indicating some relation between the two races (if they are indeed separate races). Great review, very detailed and with lots of pictures.

Lego City Truck & Forklift Set # 7733 Pieces: 343 Price: $24.99 (USD) Store of Purchase: Toys R'Us Release Date: January 2008 After discussion of the mysterious yellow cargo contained in this new City transport set and a visit to my local TRU, I purchased this set. I was immediately pleased with the price/piece which I think is pretty reasonable (343 pieces for $25). Starting with the box, great City artwork boasting "Special Edition": Tha backside of the box (no alternate models comes as no surprise): The dreaded decals (I was looking for the skull and bones for radioactive, but no such luck): My favorite part of the set, a very clever forklift: Side view: And the backside: What I like about the forklift is the bars across the top giving the vehicle a "real-life" design. The double wheels in the front with two pieces that can hold the wheels also adds to a clever design: I like the figs (although not much new - perhaps I'll make the driver into a werewolf later): The set includes three cargo pallets, the first some sort of fuel with gauge: The 2nd, two Indy containers, and a square 2x4 brick (I have not put the decals on yet): And the mysterious yellow cargo. Your guess is as good as mine :-$ . On to the truck, the front section: The front grill: Another angle: The back: I like the opening mechanism that is very simple, but works well. Also is the large plate tile piece inside. I like this because the entire interior has no studs: And the trailer section of the truck: Orange and yellow tail lights: And the rear trailer open: The complete set: Summary: This is a neat set that reminds me a bit of classic Lego City (but larger). It is very playable and has a lot of accessories adding to the value. The build was very simple, and enjoyable (took me about an hour). It is a great addition to a number of City sets including the Cargo Ship, Container Stacker, the World City Cargo Train, and the new Cargo Plane. As I mentioned previously, I have not yet put on the decals that I'm sure will really add to the overall look of the set. The forklift is awesome and I like the cargo containers. The truck could have benefited from a few additional details (chrome smokers, and an undercarriage box that really opens). Considering everything, I would buy this set again. Hope you enjoy and perhaps this mysterious cargo will make its way into a Brickster Mystery. *y*

The only problem with these big trucks is how they look on the city roadplates (I've always thought too big), compared to Classic City trucks. Getting off topic, I'd like to see Lego make a car transport truck. I don't think I've ever seen one in Lego. It would definately have to be 6-wide, or even larger.

Great review! My only grip with this set is you can only fit one pallet in the truck. It should have been the same size as the trailer so you can at least fit 2 pallets. Seems like alotof wasted space. If i'm going to transport cargo, i want to use the maximum amount of space aviable!! X-D

I got this set last week and just to add a few of my own points CONS: - The forklift spring feels a bit flimsy - I don't know how long it will last or how much stress it would take - and the end coil isn't really heavily secured to the lift mechanism. Time will tell on that one. - 30 stickers! It's the Exo-Force of City sets! The truck set does look less plain with them on though. I would reccomend lining them up with the green brick in the second container rather than applying the first lot without a guide or they may end up uneven - It's very hard to put the minifig in the forklift without dismantling (or breaking open) the set slightly - The cargo box attached to the main cabin of the truck doesn't hold very strongly - Minifigs are dull - that dark blue torso with pattern is way overused - green stickers are a different green to the bricks themselves PROS: - lots of nice pieces including the large white panels and cargo pieces, and i like the green/ white colour scheme - the cargo doors open well and the hingeing mechanism doesn't stand out to the detriment of the rest of the set (as some people have complained about the mail airplane) - studless floor in cargo containers makes it easy to move pallets in and out - fits in better than the Heavy Hauler to a minifig sized city - new 1x1x4 slope! (at least I hadn't seen it before) OVERALL - nice set with some good pictures, although a bit flimsy, and way too many stickers - the same issues I have with the Cargo Plane as well (although that had more colour issues).

Greetings, and welcome to another Redman Review! I'm your host, Redman, and today I adorn my medieval outfit to tell you about the Impulse set simply titled "The Knight". No wait, that's the old script. X-D I mean, "The Good Wizard". *sweet* The other Castle Impulse set (the first being 'The Knight'), this is a wonderful, and in my case unexpected addition to the Castle line! I did not expect to get a nice good wizard, but rather another plain white skellie for the Impulse, and was pleasantly surprised when I saw the first picture of this set. The Impulse sets give you pieces you wouldn't expect to see in such small sets, for example, The Knight came with the armour, and this comes with an owl, a gem, and a crystal ball piece. It comes with 11 pieces, including the wand, owl, and gem, and no spares, which doesn't really matter as it doesn't need any. The box sports the set number, age range (which I blissfully ignore X-D), awesome Castle logo, and the assembled set, with the usual 1:1 scale picture of a minifig. The back of the box shows pictures of the boxed Skeleton Tower and King's Castle Siege sets. Note the price is in New Zealand dollars, and is really the same prica as any other Impulse set. Next are the instructions, which are separated into 3 parts, 1 for the minifigure, 1 for the table, and one for the bird stand. Very simple, also worth mentioning is the parts numbers are next to their respective parts, for replacement parts etc. On the back we see (on the top half) pictures of Skeleton Prison Carriage, Skeleton Tower, and King's Castle Siege, this time not of the boxed sets, but the sets themselves. On the lower half we have 8 pictures, each of the different Impulse sets. The Wizard's torso is plain sand blue, with no patterns or anything, but it doesn't really matter is his beard's in the way. ;-) The head is that same old 'white fade to grey beard' head, but the white beard covers up most of the grey. My favourite part is the pants, I love that we're getting printed belts and legs again. His belt has 4 gold crosses (as seen in, if you look closely, the new Crownie's torso and the Crownie archer's torso) and a belt buckle, and the legs have a bottle, a coin, and a small bag. Nice little wizard-ey items. The, er, items, no, accessories, no, models? The stuff in the set include a little stand for the owl, and a table utilising the new 4x4 round piece in light bley, with the crystal ball in the middle, encasing the yellow gem held on by a 2x2 circle piece in blue. Why blue, I'm not sure. Maybe it's because the crystal is yellow, and the Crownie's colours are blue and gold, so the blue piece with the yellow crystal symbolise the Crownie's colours. Or maybe TLC just felt the need to include an odd colour. :-P In conclusion, this is a wonderful set, with some neat accessories, and it doesn't really need to be bought in the masses, after all, you needs an army of owls and wizards? :-| :-P So it works fine as a single set, and adds a more fantasy feel to your Crownie army. That's all for today folks! *sweet* [/Redman] Thanks for reading another of my Redman interviews, any suggestions on how to/what to do to improve it is greatly appreciated, as are all comments and criticisms (except those blatant thoughtless criticisms that don't help at all :-P)! ~Peace Edited by KimT, 10 August 2008 - 01:31 PM.

Nice review, your camera is much better now. I look forward to more of your reviews :-) I just went to Toyworld today and got a wizard and 4 knights :-) And on top of that, they were having a 20% off sale *sweet* I might go back and get some more tommorrow. The wizard is pretty good, and comes with some good parts (owl, beard, legs, hat, round table, crystal ball..). It would be nicer if he had a torso with printing on it, but I can understand why they didn't.

simonwillems, on Jan 20 2008, 02:59 PM, said: Thanks for the review of this nice little set. For it's price (3 euros here in Holland) it contains quite a lot of useful parts. The only thing that could have been better in my opinion is the wand, I always liked this one: I miss those wands! They could've used it, but I think the wood wand kindda adds "realis" to the set, and since many fans don't like their castle theme to be too fantasized, I guess Lego decided to use a mold that was still being used for various sets. When I get this set I'm going to put it on the Tower in the King's castle, you know, the one that is right above the throne room? ;-) That'll be a great spot, and then I'll finally have all the necessary characters, the King in his throne, the knights on the walls, the wizard on his tower top, and the Princess in her tower room that floats in mid air and is connected to the throne room by a 2-stud wide bridge! :-D I love the King;s castle siege set *wub*

Not bad. I could see picking up a couple of these guys along with a few of the new knights. I actually prefer the wizard as these impulse items are simply too expensive for army building (IMO). Later.

Well, since no-one seems to have done one for this set, here we go.... Here's the complete set in all its glory. Yes, I really like it, but then, Tabletown has the capacity to support it and my green Army have their eyes on it as a potential military transport as well. :-) I'll start out with the little airport ground car thingy - very neat and functional, here are views front and back: Next up, the steps which allow the plane crew to embark and disembark: And to round off this little trio, the cargo loading platform, here in its lowered position. Note the prong thingy sticking out from the rear: And here raised. The prong thingy is now hinged up to support the back of the platform and keep it level: Here's a slightly different angle so you can see the pieces under there: The all-important cargo itself! Hmmm...not much for a plane this size... The cargo pallet slots neatly onto the loading platform: Here's the complete set of ground equipment - all attached: And so onto the plane itself. Note that unlike the other large planes, the main wing sits at the TOP of the row of bricks making up the side of the fuselage: I took it apart a little so you can see the internal construction of the fuselage. Note that the cargo area is really small, right at the back. What else is this thing carrying? Illegal immigrants? :-) A picture of the rear of the fuselage, just because I like the sticker: Front landing gear. WAY better than on the other large planes. I don't know if this is a new piece or what but I've had no problems with it at all, and my kids have been playing with it as well: The rather sexy rear undercarriage - this area reminds me of one of those giant Russian transport planes - wicked: Those angled grey slopes atop each side of the rear undercarriage annoy the heck out of me as they KEEP COMING OFF whenever I pick the plane up. I think a 1x4 plate on top to bind them together might solve that. A slightly blurry view (sorry) from underneath. The gear LOOKS like it might be capable of retracting internally, but alas, no. This is a shame as there's certainly enough room in there and it's a wasted opportunity IMO. Might have to modify that... A view of one of the four engines, I personally think they look too small and should have something under the wing as well to make them rounder: Cockpit: Crew door, open. I LOVE the smooth action of these doors and the way they seal flush against the fuselage when closed: Cargo door, open: Crew door with docked ladder: Cargo door with docked loading platform: Cargo slots inside and locks into place the same way it sits on the loader, neat: The minifigs, sorry this one is a bit blurry: And that concludes this week's "Show and Tell".

Thanks for the review! *sweet* That's all the space you get. Now, it MIGHT be possible to rip out that rear bulkhead at the back of the wing and fill the middle area with tiles so cargo pallets could slide up the fuselage. But that would definitely prevent the undercarriage folding internally if that's what you wanted to do as well. Dr. S.

I loved the pics in the catalogues but was a bit disappointed by the build and end result. My own thoughts: CONs: - as noted, the cargo space is really small considering the size of the plane, although I can see this is restricted due to playability - without the barrier in the middle, the cargo would slide all over the place while the plane was being swooshed - the cargo 'lift' (I'm not sure how else to describe it) is very weak and snaps off, although it is a clever design I think it's badly implemented - there is nothing to hold the cargo pallet to the cargo lift truck so it tends to slide off all over the place as soon as the truck moves - colour issues - I had at least 3 shades of green with the larger plane pieces and noticeable variances even with identical cargo hatch pieces. At least one of them also came quite scratched, which was a little disappointing - At $79.95 AUD it's $10 more than the Passenger Plane was with less pieces and figs, and no printed pieces whatsoever! more $ for less, methinks. PROs: - Lots of nice cargo crate pieces and even the stickers for these are pretty good. - landing gear piece adjusts very well to height differentials so the plane doesn't lose its gear as often as the earlier passenger planes - the hinging mechanism works very well to open the cargo holds - opens very smoothly and is not noticeable - I'd definitely like to see more of this technique - the little vehicles work well chained together and are all good small designs OVERALL: - I really like the large planes since 06 but I don't think they've still quite hit the nail on the head. Whereas the earlier planes were a little flimsy, this one is sturdier but has its own issues. The look of the Cargo Plane is nice, and the new landing piece and cargo hatch pieces are really great, but some design weaknesses and colour issues detract from the overall product. It's a shame as with a bit of tweaking this could have been a must-have set.

Wow, that's a great review of a great set Dr S! *y* As you yourself have already noted, this has the potential to be a fantastic military MOC! With a bit of modification you can get the engines to be rounder, or perhaps do away with them completely and replace them with jet engines. *sweet* Though I can't think of a system to retract the undercarriage at the top of my head it seems like there's indeeed more than enough potential to do so. It reminds me rather of an Ilyushin Il-76, one of my favourite cargo planes. :'-)

Nice review, Dr. S! I have been thinking long and hard about the scale of the planes in my town. I would like to keep my passenger planes in their classic 4-wide fuselage style, but I really don't mind the new plane hull pieces if they are used as an enormous transport plane like the Ilyushin-76. Unfortunately I can't afford this lovely new green one at the moment (which would be perfect to go with my green army) as I took too much of a hit buying the new 2008 Star Wars sets! But I have modified my white one to take huge cargo loads, in fact my APC is designed specifically to fit inside. Unfortunately I'm a bit busy to take pics at the moment, but hope to put some up soon.

At my local Wal*Mart there was most of the 2008 sets including the Indiana Jones ones :'-) I picked up this one and the Motorcycle Chase! Name: 7621 Lost Tomb Price: $20.00 Parts: 277 Figs: 3 *Box Art First off we have the great Indiana Jones Box art!! I must say the designers did an excellent job on it! I love the little temple design with skulls! As well as including Indy in the right hand corner. The back of the box is just as cool showing all the neat play features of the set as well as an advertisement for the Indiana Jones Game *Figs First off we have our hero, Indian............. What the hell? Why is there a freaking CW Anakin head on Indy!! There was a production slip up as instead of Indy's head I get Anakin's! :-| |-/ I open the box up and there staring me in the face is his ugly face!! TLC is defiantly doing to here a gnarly complaint from me!! >:-( Ok now here we have the " real" Indy fig that is supposed to come with the set :-D I just noticed that his fedora hat goes down in the back! Bonus Picture Time, Here is a jacketless Indy with his sleeve torn off, like he looks in the Temple of doom *sweet* The next figure up is our lovely Marion *wub* *wub* *wub* Plus her head is reversible with a scared face X-D Love the new hairpiece in black!! Finally we have our undead skellie with second style head and poseable arms *The Well Of Souls The set itself is a nice model and playset! The Anubis statues are very cool and I love all the hieroglyphs on the walls 8-? Here is the SW link with Artoo and 3P0 X-D The Ark in its resting place The Ark removed, its very cool indeed, but TLC should have made the whole thing in chrome gold |-/ not metallic gold with brown and yellow!! The closeup of the Anubis statue, Yes the Eye is a sticker but at leasts a gold color! *Playability First off you can pull the pin on the Anubis statues which send them falling and taking out the walls. Behind the wall a skellie swings out! There is a lever in the back of the model where you push down and the snakes shower down upon the figs hehe With the snakes all around, Marion is both modeling with the new carrot torch and fending off viscous cobras :-D In the meantime Indy uses his whip to scale the wall and avoid all the snakes which he is afriad of. In the meantime leaving Marion behind to fight them off. :-P The whip is bendable but it will always snap back into a coil, its some type of bendy hard plastic *Scoring Figs- 9/10 Model- 8/10 Playability- 8.5/10 Overall Satisfaction- 4/10 (would be 9/10 if it wasn't for the stupid Anakin head error!) In the end this is a charming set and could easily fit in with the adventurers! It has the cool Anubis statues as well as the Ark. Plus Indy, Marion and a skellie, great selection of figs but Sallah would have been better since he actually removes the ark with Indy However I am still wondering the point of the Anubis statues, this set does seem pretty silly :-P P

Thanks for a nice review, Piranha. *y* A lovely playset, with a classical Egyptian adventurers touch. Although I?m not completely sure for the robot arms for the statues.... Somehow, a little more details could?ve worked well for that set.... 8-|

Wow I can't believe other people have had this same head error mistake! X-O I thought it was one of those extreme cases of production slip up! The good thing is I will get a replacement Indy head, and get to keep that Anakin head!! I forgot to mention that my set was also missing 1 black ear piece for the Anubis statues There also are extra stickers for my set, I can't figure out what they are for though? hehe, I too like my TOD Indy fig 8-| :-D P

I got mine today! X-D I too got an Anakin Clone Wars head, although I'm not really complaining since I already have an Indy head from the Motorcycle Chase set. It is really odd that they would pack in such a different looking head though. Also, for those that think the head has no use, try placing it under one of the braided new brown dwarf beards. It looks pretty nice, I think! *y* On the set, it's wonderful! The hieroglyphic stickers are wonderful, Marion (especially her head and hair) is wonderful, and the Anubis statues are nice too. There's also lots of nice tan parts, such as 20 round 2x2s, and 8 1x8 bricks. All in all, it's a great set for the price, and I can't wait to get Race for the Stolen Treasure and Temple Escape now! *sweet*

It looks to me that the little building is supposed to be like some sort of Customs checkpoint between one nation and another or like a toll facility on a highway. I like the little checkpoint but I think that should be part of a separate set and 7743 just having the Police Mobile Command Center truck.

Hello and welcome to another, oh wait, first Batbrick and iamded review! Today us two sworn enemies will be reviewing the Creator Cargo Chopper, here is the front of the box: And while pushing iamded to his doom, here is the back: Haha! Ouch! Oh dear...here are the parts anyway... Here is the instruction of the first model, the Cargo Chopper. I love Creator sets for the different models, they always excite me. Just ignore me finishing off my nemesis in the background. Something very interesting that I liked in the instructions was this step where you must add those three 2x2 yellow rounded pieces under the chopper. This is for support while you build, which is handy, and later you take it off: And even later use it as the cargo. I found that to be rather innovative and clever, as well as - Hey! What are you hitting me for? Both instruction booklets have the same back: Now heres the Chopper itself. I love the design of it, it isn't quite minifig scale but its great all the same. This is my first non-Xpod or House creator set, and it sure is fun. Here me and iamded go for a dizzy ride. I love the nose of the copter, and the landing gear is fantastic. A shot from the other side. Oh dear, it seems we've been a bit sick from that ride, and were vomiting transgreen 1x1s. The cargo itself is nicely made, though I forgot to put on two tiles here :-$ . It fits in real well with the chopper to, and the line is great for giving iamded the wedgie he deserves: This is my first power function set, so I was pretty excited. The motor is intergrated really well into this set, and is activated by pushing that little 3x2 plate with the 1x1 slopes on it forward, until it hits the motor button, that orange knob. Another point of interest is the use of bley barrels on each side. I like this as I don't have those pieces in that colour. A shot of the motor. Its really simple, all you do is pull the hook out to any length that allows, then press the orange button and it will wind it back up. This makes the Chopper pull the cargo up into its bay, and iamded pull me here reluctantly to a whacking: A top view, is that MY head? A view of the chopper without the cargo in it. I love the lowered cockpit: The leftover pieces from building: (NOTE: iamded's head does not count as set piece) And a final shot of the set with me and iamded. Oh, it appear we're dead, oh dear... Hope you enjoyed this review, soon I will post the two alternate models. I loved this chopper, its great to play with and has nice construction. It also has some handy pieces too. The motor function sounds like a gimmick but is well intergrated into this model. Well worth the price, so far this is another win for Creator I say! So far I recommend this model, but later we'll see if the alt models are up to scratch. Also, since this is my first review, comments and criticism welcome on everything.

Thanks everyone, heres part 2: The second instruction booklet includes instructions for both alternate models, which is good, I hate having too many manuals: Here she is, the plane: Its very nice and well proportioned, but where did iamded get that laser? Overview, the landing gear is very sturdy and nice, and the wings are surprisingly good: Top view, iamded's head fell into the propellers, I was trying to save him, honest! A view of how the motor on this one works, by pushing the orange button you can make the prop spin. It is well integrated like the chopper, though the prop only spins for about 2 1/2 seconds. Still, its a nice feature: The tail is also well made, simple, but lovable. Oh, and check out that tank! The prop spinning, Agh! Is that MY hand? Final view, there seems to be some sort of explosion here 8-| Well I think I got iamded more than me atleast. The second model is also great, though not as good as the chopper. The lack of space to fit something into the cockpit brings it down a bit, but it is a very nice model overall. I recommend it, though unlike the chopper it will be hard to mod into minifig scale. So far so good with 4995, here are the leftover pieces from the model: Enjoy! Batbrick Away! >:-)

Thanks guys, heres the final part: The Instructions for the boat begin on page 46: The overall set, its actually much nicer than I thought it would be, the pictures on the box make it look ugly. Top view, Tommy Guns do not actually come with set ;-) Side view, the designers have done an excellent job with the hull, considering the lack of many slopes pieces. You can see it is pretty much minifig scale too: Here you can see that by pushing in the red technic axle, the "anchor" on the front will be hauled back into the boat: Back view, these outboard motors are pretty cool, though I wish they could go own into the water more: Overall, though the weakest model, its still a lot of fun, and has a clever way around the lack of a shapely hull. I was impressed with it after the building it, it even has two rounded SNOTTy bottom pieces on the nose of the boat to give the impression it is speeding through the water with the front lifting up. Lots of leftover pieces for this one: The pieces: Sorry about the poor photograph there, it was getting late :-$ Overall the Cargo Chopper is another great set in the fantastic Creator line. Loads of fun, great play, and some clever designs, it challenges you to make your own things, and even includes some nifty pieces (bley barrels! *wub* ) I won't give it a rating, but I'll just say I certainly recommend it to fans of the theme and Lego fans in general. Now, finally, iamded and I teamup in the face of a larger foe. Get that Lord of Pies! Batbrick Away! >:-)

6258 Smuggler's Shanty Overview Smuggler's Shanty was released in 1992, it consisted of 69 pieces, 3 minifigs (two pirates, one Imperial) and it cost $9.25 (USD). The set itself is a small but rather sturdy den for the pirates! Review: The minifigs consist of two pirates and one Imperial. The minifigs are not all that rare, which is disappointing, I would of liked a rarer fig! But still it is a good cheap source of pirate and Imperial figures. Here is an overall shot of the set, which includes the three figs, the shanty which is made using palm leaves pieces, and a nice grey shark nibbling at the soldier's oar. A close up of the soldier rowing hard in his boat. I would have preferred to have a normal soldier with shako hat, as I have more officers than normal soldiers now!: And a close up snap of the main structure. Note the wine glass, which was a nice touch! Funnily enough, only 4 pieces of treasure were included in this set, compared to the usual 8 gold coins in other sets. A view from the back, which also gives a good view of the pieces used to construct the shanty mainly simple black 1 by 1 bricks: The Shanty looks good from most angles but their are a few where the roof construction looks rather odd, but that is just a minor nitpick! Yet another view from the front,, this time at a slightly different angle. The yellow base plate looks rather nice too, I prefer it over the tan pieces we trend to get nowadays: "Attack!!" The Stupid drunk pirate in the background does not even notice! Overall I think this is a rather good set, despite some shortcomings, such as the lack of treasure and odd roof from some angles. The shark, Imperial soldier and useful parts make up for it, and of course the price is cheap on most auction sites, I got mine for a mere ?5 ($10), with the cheapest price on Bricklink being $8. Rate the set then leave your comments, thoughts and opinions!!!

Great little set! I bought this set only a few years ago MISB and I am still very happy about it. The hut is simple but very effective as a castaway building on some deserted island, the palmleaves are a good addition to any Lego collection. This set had a nice amount of weapons, two for each pirate and two of those weapons are flintlock muskets as opposed to just pistols. Nice poll as well, but you made sure nobody can give this set a 1 which is very nice (but probably a little mistake :-D ). I gave it the top-rating. *y*

I bought one of these new from Bricklink a few months ago as part of my Pirate splurge I went on.

Well since this topic has resurfaced, I would add my 2 cents about my appreciation of this set. It was the first and (unfortunately) the largest Pirate set I owned as a kid, but I played the wazoo out of it. Some of the minifigs have lost almost all their face printing after so many play sessions! Theres just something about the hut that appealed to me more than the cheesy skull-face islands we keep getting.Probably that it wa kind of neutral, good for my pirates, settlers or islanders. Though the palm leaves were rather fragile and used to break off the studded parts. It would be nice to get more of these "beach village army builder" sets.

Hi guys. I picked these up the other day, but it's taken me this long to get round to posting the reviews. So, here we go: Tub comparison with a minfig (thanks Brainbox): The lighting changes a bit throughout the photographs, as it was going dark outside, so I only really had my desk light, and I kept getting in the way. 4837 Mini Trains Now the box I really like. It's no different to those of last year's sets, but the colour here is simply fantastic, and really seems appropriate for the theme. So this is what you get inside. All the pieces are still inside the bag, the optical illusion was accidental :-D . No pieces of particular outstanding interest, but the dark green cheese slopes are rather nice. Look out for those later. 1 2 3 This is the main model, and uses all the pieces in the set (bar these two, which according to the inventory are spares, but as with all my other Creator sets, I'm cheating and leaving them in). This is far and away the best model of the three, and evokes the iconic version of a steam train. The green looks superb, but I'm not sure whether that's due to the model itself or the actual colour. Moving on, we get to the second model: 1 Leftovers (yes, I admit, I was using a piece of paper) This isn't actually a bad model. I don't think it's quite as nice as the previous one, but it's not bad. It's different from the first model as well, which is good. Too muich of the same can be a bad thing. Finally, we come to the third model: Leftovers Now... I'll be honest. I don't really know what this is. It's not that good a model compared to the other two. That's all I can say, really. And of course, all the pieces fit into the tub. Overall: I have to say, I do like this set, despite the weak third model. The strength of the primary and secondary models make up for any weaknesses in the third, and I can imagine the pieces being fully usuable in building other trains. While the basic idea of these tubs isn't quite as good as the X-Pods with regards portability and general 'niceness' they aren't bad. And for a fairly cheap price (?3-4) as well. 4838 Mini Vehicles This is one of those set boxes that you see because of the ridiculously loud colours. Sound marketing scheme if you ask me. I've managed it again. There are pieces outside the bag. Or are there? Now these I like *y* . 1 2 (I don't know what the clip is for, there isn't one on the other side) 3 4 5 This is the main model of the set, and again all the pieces are used bar these three, the spares. It's quite a nice model, although the car's a bit odd. Still, I like the ramps, and the colour scheme reminds me just a little of G1 Ultra Magnus. Hmm, I think that boom arm could do with refixing... 1 2 Leftovers This is actually quite nice as well. It's that classic breakdown truck, and the boom arm itself is quite nice, with quite a bit of movement. Another solid model. 1 Leftovers I'm surprised by the amount of detail here actually. Not only have TLC included a spare wheel at the back, but also what looks like a trailer hitch, which all adds to the 'realism.' Another nice model to round out a nice set. And in the tub. Overall: I'm not sure which of the two I like better. When I bought them, and on the way home, I much preferred the train set. But after building this set, I'm not sure. This is another good set from the year when TLC seems to be giving us so many. There are some good pieces in here too, and while there's nothing unique, they're still good. So, thanks for reading, hope it helped someone, and if there are any requests, I'll see what I can do. That's requests for pics, not songs ;-) . Edited by WhiteFang, 23 May 2009 - 06:56 PM. Indexed

So here it is finally, my first ever review of a lego set..oh wait, it's actually 2 sets. So i don't really know how to do it right, but i'll try the best. (Sorry if some pictures are a litte bit dark, but i'm not really into photography and i got bad light here) Let's Start with the Dwarf's Mine Defender: Theme: Castle 2008 Set Name: Dwarf's Mine Defender Number: 7040 Pieces: 86 Price: ?9,99 (EUR) First, as always, the box: The back, a few instructions on how the defender works, for those how don't know ;-) : And the instructions: We continue with the minifigs, sorry i forgot to make a closeup of the dwarf: And finally the mine defender itself, i personally think it isn't as bad as maybe some people think. The chain for the catapult is great i think: I kinda love those controls, the mechanism with the rubbe rband actually works pretty well, but only on a not-glossy underground. That's pretty much all of it, it's small but i like it a lot. So let's go on to the tower raid now, which would be my absolute favorite of those new sets. -------------------------------------- Theme: Castle 2008 Set Name: Tower Raid Number: 7037 Pieces: 364 Price: ?29,99 (EUR) Again, first the box & Instructions: We got 2 sets of instructios here, one for the tower and one for the siege tower: The Minifigs, we got one archer and one soldier here, both with the torsos of the 2007 sets: Now thw orc side, starting with the great leader, with the new armor and the golden helmet (i love those pieces!): Closeup of the armor & helmet: Then we got another orc-knight: And the prisoner, with handcuffs! The Crownie Tower looks great overall, though there is something i don't really like about it, but later on that. Now the back, and that is what really bothers me, there areno walls on the first floor except the one with the wall-piece and the door, and theprison also is open at the back. The orc easily could jump out there: Not sure what these are all about, they really don't add much to the set: Enough rant now, let's go on with a pretty sweet detail, the golden crystal on the little table: The wall piece on the first floor you can ram in: And finally the very best thing of this set, the amazing orc siege tower! From the front: The great working ram, you can pull it back very far and it got pretty much power: Here we got another sweet detail, the siege "platform" that moves out by pulling a cord in the back of the tower: Finally a picture of a bit siege action: If you ram in the lower wallpiece, the brown shelfs of the prison-floor collapse and the prisoned orc is finally free! Summary: Likes: As i mentioned before, i really think that's the best ever produced siege tower, it's got so mich details and works extremely well, also the overall look of it is magnificant. The destroy-mechanism of the tower is pretty cool too, the brown door is a fine detail too. Nothing much to say about the mine defender, i like this little set, and there's nothing really to bother about it. Dislikes: The Back of the tower. That's really the only thing that's a bit bad imo, they could have put there 2 more walls on the first floor and something to lock the prison easily. Final Thought: The Tower Raid for me personally is the best of the 2008 sets so far, it's got great playability and looks simply good. My opinion: Buy it!

Great review, pictures and all! Thanks for showing all the mechanisms of the tower, I didn't notice them from either the pics we had or the instructions--it didn't hit me that when you knock down the wall the second floor breaks. That is a genius idea. This looks like a superb set, unfortunately my priority right now is the Troll Warship. Still, if that really is U.S. $80, I might skip it and go for this instead, which is only $20 US. One note, though. I think there might not be a back cage on the second floor of the tower so that the mechanism can work. Did you try to see if the second floor ground still falls if you add it a fourth cage wall? Also, you could just pretend that the tower is built against a mountainside. It would fit perfectly and add more defense to the Knights. Great review! :-) VK

I got myself today 3 Dwarf's Mine Defender and I have to say that sets does suck big time: the plastic rubber band doesn't do squat, and 3 wheels i really not enough. I only built 2 of those and changed the front of it with 4 wheels and no plastic rubber band and I changed the 2x2 dark bley plate. Its still looks good but the crappy rubber band system is really not well thought off. Anyhow my Orc army is growing >:-) *yoda*

The rubber system is not effective at all. I bought 2 defenders recently and i found out that when the wheels move, the rubber just stuck there without rotating the blades at the front :-/ I have not really found a solution for mine yet. So far, i only took out the rubber band, placing the blades on the ground, removing of the red technic part on the left side. In this way, when the defender is moving on smooth ground, the blades will move too ;-)

Green Grocer Reviewed by Dunamis Set 10185 2,352 Pieces $149.95 from The LEGO Store (Glendale, CA) Build time 6.5 hours Holy guacamole! Almost exactly one year after Caf? Corner was released we get the third installment in the increasingly popular LEGO exclusive town series. Combined with the famous 10182 Caf? Corner and its trusty companion 10190 Market Street this trio makes the foundation for an amazing city block of LEGO goodness. For those new to this series of sets, check out my reviews of the two previous sets in this line: Cafe Corner Market Street I would not necessarily recommend reading too many of my reviews in one setting as you might experience loss of brain cells and/or drowsiness. You have been warned. So, how does Green Grocer stack up to the two previous sets you ask? Well, follow along kind reader and I shall attempt to unravel this question. The Box: The gigantic box is pretty standard and looks amazingly similar to the Caf? Corner box. The back of the box shows some of the features of the green grocer as well as a lot of the cool interior that was absent from the previous sets. In addition, we are shown an image of the three sets together and a small insert image showing how they connect together (as if we could not master that difficult maneuver?) Opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals. As it seems to be the norm now, we have the reusable cereal box type tab system that we saw so often in 2007 sets. However, upon opening the tabs we are pleasantly surprised to find a cardboard tray! Have not seen one of those in a while. As you can see in the photo, we have two 32x16 green base plates, three instruction manuals and a bunch of bags that are broken into four groups: Group 1 has 12 bags and goes with the first manual and builds the first floor. Group 2 has 9 bags and goes with the second manual to build the second floor. Group 3 has 14 bags and goes with the third manual for the top floor and roof. And one bag that is not numbered and hence you can open it whenever you feel like it. There are no stickers ? Yay! Moving right along, we get to the three instruction manuals. The Manuals: The three manuals are 55, 47 and 47 pages in length. They are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings: - Piece call outs for each step - Parts inventory at the end of the second manual - Page numbers Color separation in these manuals was fine for me except dark bley and black. We get a nice photo of all three sets together: Plus, we get a nice tip showing how to split up the bags and what goes where. Those additional pieces you see in the photo just below the numbered bags are the pieces that come from the single un-numbered bag (along with the base plates). Parts list Random manual shot The Pieces: Upon opening the first set of bags, one thing is clear; there are a TON of little tiny pieces! The minifigs are included in this first section as well. Interesting to note that there are a handful of printed pieces and as I mentioned previously, no stickers. We also get a host of new and exciting pieces to add to our collection. Keep in mind my scope of LEGO sets is generally centered around Star Wars, Technic, Creator and the occasional racer set so what is new to me might have been around 15 years. At any rate, here are some of the more interesting pieces: Again, note the printed tiles. This time around, LEGO has decided to include 33% more minifigs than the Caf? Corner and Market Street sets. Yes, we get four minifigs instead of three! Here are the cast of characters: Pictured (left to right) is Sir Top Hat, Miss Jenny Blue Overalls, Patti O? Furniture and little Timmy Cub Scout. I?ll leave it up to the minifig aficionados to decipher which torsos are new and to tell us all about the hairpieces. I can say with reasonable certainty that the four yellow smiley heads are not new (somebody check that?) Don?t forget the lovable little cat named ?Tom?. He is the arch-rival of the mouse ?Jerry? that lives downstairs: Overall, there are a lot of pieces, large variety and wide range of colors. The Build: If you have either of the two previous sets, you will feel right at home here. Just like in the previous builds, it seems like the first ten build steps are consumed with laying a bunch of 1x1, 1x2 and 2x2 tiles everywhere. Almost feels like 30% of the pieces are used up right away (see below). There are several sections where you build various parts of the interior. Take a look at the cash register/counter below: And the beverage cooler: And the produce stand and everything that goes in it: Looks like someone has mail: Looks like someone just had a baby: This set is incredibly well done and gives inspiration to go back and add similar items to Caf? Corner and Market Street. As before, the average builder is introduced to some new building techniques like using the hinge plates to make the angles on the front of the building as shown below: Also the top of the roof shows some interesting ideas: Overall, it is a really fun build that kept me entertained the whole way. The Design: This is a great set with lots of little details. I especially like the little mouse hole in the wall leading to the Jerry the mouse?s area. They even included a little slice of cheese! It seems the designers can?t get away from the ?usual? staircase which I always feel is way too big. Maybe future designs can incorporate a spiral staircase to save room for other things in the model. One welcome addition is the fire escape as seen below: I?m going to show a bunch of examples of various items in the set so you can get the feel of the amazing detail in this design. Take a look at the lamps (torches?) just outside the door: And the streetlight with fire hydrant: Brickwork and archway: Awning: Here is the back side of the building. Note the trashcans and yard tools: Here is a close-up of the railings on the second story balcony and the second photo is the finished product with curtains in the window. Nice use of cups to make the banister on the second floor: Here is the fireplace on the second floor: Second floor staircase with Tom?s hiding spot: Check out the radiator on the third floor: More third floor: Nice grandfather clock and rug (third floor) Check out the deck that is up on the roof. Complete with two chairs, table, umbrella, flower pots and grill: Interesting use of minifig hammers on the roof: Finally, here is what is left over when we?re done: A couple of shots of the front: A shot of the back: And here are all three together: Overall Thoughts: This is an incredible set and the best of the three in my opinion. It is hard to top Caf? Corner but I believe Green Grocer just did. I absolutely love all the details and building techniques that went into making this set. There is a ton of different parts and wide color selection. As usual, we get a bunch of tiles and small plates, but that goes with the series. Also, we get four minifigs and lots of minifig accessories. I?m giving this set a score of 100%! I thought about it and I really don?t know how they could have made it any better. In short, RUN don?t walk to go pick this set up! Final Rating: 100% Build 10/10 (Excellent - Lots of nice interiors, details and accessories to build.) Functionality 10/10 (Outstanding. Raises the bar with interior and detail. Think Caf? Corner on steroids.) Design 10/10 (Excellent ? can?t say enough good things about it.) Parts 10/10 (Great selection and diverse colors. Great minifigs.) Price 10/10 (Price ratio is excellent but lots and lots of little parts. Well worth the price.) As alway, feel free to comment, complain and question what you see here. I'd like to hear your feedback on this amazing set.

I didn't know Green Grocer had a rodent infestation !! And the use of the new built furniture and detils like the radiator is freaking awsome !! Also that set has a definite plus for me: its the back details !! I love the stairs, the deck with table !! Wowx that is what I call sweet backdoor details !!

Very nice. Very nice, indeed. Lots of lovely, little details, even at the back. This review hasn't changed my opinion one bit, I'm still looking forward to when I can finally pick up mine at the post office. I'm crossing my fingers that there will be more buildings following after this one. I'm guessing that LEGO's just testing the waters to see how far AFOL's are willing to go regarding price vs. details. Green Grocer is still epic, though.

Truly an awesome review. Thanks Dunamis. I ordered my two copies (one to build, one to store in the "vault") last week. Can't wait to get this one! The attention to detail here is what makes the set great. There's nothing to criticize about this set. It's really the closest thing to perfection that I have seen from TLC. The difference between this set and CC is the interior detail, and because of that, GG now become (in my opinion) the best set EVER released by TLC. Do the CC/GG/MS sets fit well with the 50th anniv. town plan? My impression is that out of the box, at least, they don't. Which is too bad. However, I don't think it would be hard to mod the Town Plan so it looks like it belongs in the same town as CC/GG/MS. These sets, to me, are what I have always wanted from TLC as an adult. I hope they keep up the line, and add more elements to this excellent lineup.

Thanks for all the feedback. As you can tell, I really enjoyed building it. Cardinal Brick, on Mar 8 2008, 09:26 AM, said: Is it the first set you'e given 100% to? Yes, it is. I gave Cafe Corner a 96% and I felt this was a better set and improved on the things that I dinged Cafe Corner on (lack of minifigs was one thing.) That's why I enjoy reading the comments so I can see if my ratings are in line with what everyone else thinks and to see if I missed anything. I can't wait for some of you to build it and share your thoughts as well.

The amount of details is exceptional, from the different railings to the mousehole and the radiator.... sheer brilliant. :'-) And two female MFs (or hippies, you never know....) and a child.... only one adult male character who nearly looks like.... well, anyways. It?s simply a milestone, and a very creative and inspiring beauty. *wub* Easter Parade on! And, sweet GG.... will you marry me? :-$

I?ve got something, I want to share with you. A beautiful dream came true: #1: the box: Top: Back: the alternate model is also very well done. The pneumatics dump the bucket and open the flap (?). Open: you can see a diagram how the pneumatics work. Just a happy kid playing. The plastic inlays (?): All: #2: the parts: As you can see, 8854 offers a very large variety of different parts. Loads of Technic bricks, gears and even plates. Also note the threaded axle 10, 5 large pulleys, a big turntable and the 1x20 Rack. #3: building: The mechanism for the outriggers and the rotation of the turntable: The turntable: The pneumatics are finished: The mechanism for the telescope: The finished model: #4 random shots: You can see how the turntable will be rotated. Thanks for reading- erm? viewing the pictures! Please comment if you want to!

Looks like you have the original 1989 version with the yellow top cylinders. :-) I got one too several years ago, although I probably paid too much for it. :-P On a side note, if that pneumatic tubing feels harder and stiffer than the modern type, I highly recommend that you don't use it and buy some of the newer stuff off Bricklink instead. TLC originally used a different material for the tubes and this stuff degrades the nozzles (on pistons, switches and so on) over time. The old tubes also grip the nozzles much more firmly and if you aren't careful when removing them, it's actually possible to rip off the nozzles completely. X-O I had this happen a few years ago, although TLC replaced my broken pistons for free. I got rid of that stuff for good after that, although the pistons on my Power Crane still have slightly discolored nozzles. Edited by CP5670, 10 March 2008 - 04:57 AM.

Thanks for another fun review! This set is high on my list of things to buy, I love cranes, built many and bought many including the classic 8460 from 1995 and the more recent 8421. That threaded axle never stopped intriguing me... It was use in so few sets (I believe 8851 contained one as well?) and I still don't know why it's better than any other axle. Congratulations with a near mint copy of this set! :-)

It was use in so few sets (I believe 8851 contained one as well?) and I still don't know why it's better than any other axle. The purpose of the threaded axle is to carry tension. Regular axles are used primarily for carrying torsion (for gears), sometimes for compression (8855 landing gear, helicopter skids), and sometimes just for looks (roll cages, canopies). But used in tension, connectors will usually just pop off. With the threads and the corresponding nuts, this part can be used to squeeze parts together (like the pen in the plotter of 8094), or to hold heavy assemblies onto turntables (like 8862 and 8851). With the power crane (8854) reviewed here, that is the complete list of sets which used this part. I wrote about it here: http://www.ericalbre...1984.html#Parts Eric

Hi! This is my third (old-school) technic set review! I don?t want to talk much, please enjoy just the pictures! #1 the parts: #2 building: The two axles, you can see in the middle, are not connected and don?t belong to each other. The axle on the left side is for the steering, on the right side for the engine. The dark-gray ?Technic Gear 16 Tooth with Clutch? allows the connection from the differential gear to the engine, trough the axle for the steering. The V6-engine: The winch: That?s a part you don?t see everyday: a 1x2 Rack. It only reappears in 2 sets from 2001 and 2004. (The Rebel Wrecker has been released in 1994.) The ?Front double wishbone with anti-sway bar?-suspension (yeah, I got it from Technopedia! X-D ) The finished model: #3 random shots: I really like this picture! Authoritative, isn?t it? 8-? :-D Thanks for viewing the pictures! Please comment if you want to!

Nice pictures. I also sort out the pieces the same way if I'm rebuilding a model. *y* This set packs a lot of functionality into a fairly small size, but was rather expensive for its size ($70) when it was still available, compared to other sets of that time. You can also rig up the Technic flag sticker that it comes with to the main model. I've done that on mine. You may want to reinforce it with tape if you're going to leave the model on display though, as it will break up over time due to UV exposure like many stickers do. I had to do that with mine after it started to crack, although it still looks pretty good.

the only original stickers are the front headlight-patterns on the 2 red 1x2 bricks. The others have been destroyed - must have been the bad decaying sticker quality that breaks when you'll remove it - so I printed them. I didn't print the flag for only the alternate model needs it, although it's a neat idea...! and LordGalewind: clickey! I keep that in mind. One of my 8880 is already dusty enough!

Thanks for reviewing this classic set. I got it when it first came out and still love it: the suspension, steering and robust look of the model haven't been done that well ever since. This set puzzled me though, back in the days. The rear suspending part containing the differential and some gears was shown different on the box from the instructions. In the instructions it showed that the (grey part of the suspension) in the back had to be made using a 1x2 smooth tile and 4 cornerplates (2x2) in grey. The box however showed a much sturdier solution using a 1x8 tile and a 1x8 plate. It is also visible on the cover of the instructions. The pieces I mean are in this picture: BerndDasBrot, on Mar 9 2008, 07:05 PM, said: Otherwise, great set!

Thanks! You've just motivated me to go on a "senseless-preliminary-design-errors-hunt"...! A few things I've discovered: Left Side (Alternate Model): the steering link can only be put in place with a little violence... the handlebar (?) is turned (far more than it's actually possible) although the wheels are straight. Right Side: The 1x8 Tile simonwillems pointed out The half bush right next to it is... *can't_find_the_words* ..."wrong". Could be that the Technic Triangle is missing. The "windscreen"- 1x6 Technic Plates are mounted with 1/2 pins instead of Axle Pins with half bushes. Who can find more...? X-D

I've seen a few cases like this where the box pictures are slightly different from the actual model. The Airtech Claw Rig compressor is another one that comes to mind. The changes sometimes seem pointless and make you wonder why they bothered. :-P Quote the only original stickers are the front headlight-patterns on the 2 red 1x2 bricks. The others have been destroyed - must have been the bad decaying sticker quality that breaks when you'll remove it - so I printed them. I didn't print the flag for only the alternate model needs it, although it's a neat idea...! The other stickers on mine have held up pretty well, although I didn't try to remove them after I put them on. The flag started to break after a year or so and just fell off its axle at one point. I taped over it and it's holding up well now, although it's a little frayed along one edge. This is actually the earliest set I've seen that uses this crappy sticker material (which is unfortunately very common today). Even other Technic sets had good stickers for many years after that.

It 'worked' with my copy. :-D So this set is capable of demolishing itself.... But still, one of the best Technicsets I have, with all stickers intact. I'm not so sure about that flag though, must check on that.

Hello, my dear friends! Here's something new. I am actually making a review with pictures! Yes, I got a new camera for christmas. Now I was testing to see how the camera would reflect, so some of the pics are a bit blurry. I have based this review from Dunamis's reviews. He is my inspiration.So, without further ado, I bring you the Review! Set #: 7693 Name: ETX Alien Strike Price: $19.99, ?12,99 Pieces: 246 Box: Okay, so as you can see below, the Box is pretty simple. As always, European versions won't have the Piece count, name, etc, just the Number I believe. Mine, having the American Version, has the info on it. as you can see, it has the Classic MM logo, and the red Planet, as well as the set in a pose itself. Very Nice. I linked it because the Pic wasn't resizing. http://www.brickshel...ke/dscn0017.jpg Below is the back of the box. It shows the other sets and some features of this set. Contents: Next we have the Contents. This set includes a medium sized DSS (xwingyoda), a bag labeled one, and HUGE bag labeled two, the 1 bag contains a smaller bag, and the two bag includes two smaller bags. 5 bags in all. Also pictured are the instructions. I have linked it due to the non-resize. http://www.brickshel...ke/dscn0019.jpg Figs: Included in this set are three figs. Two jellies, and 1 astro. The jeelies are fine, but I pefer the LoM ones. But they glow. Those new alien commanders for Summer look promising though. The astro is nice, and includes an extra gold Visor. MOC ON! Astro Miner: In all MM sets there is a human and alien set. The Astro par of this set is a Mini-miner. Here is a pic of construction and that wonderful space logo sticker. Not Much of a cockpit. :-/ Finished Miner(The set number, too): Overall I like the miner, and It is nicely designed. I feel the cockpit is lacking though. Aliens: The alien Vehical is the Main part of the set. This pic shows the beginning steps. Solid and sturdy. But those four axles/pin parts(blue) are pointless. No support, and they don't get used at all. Nice TLC. :-| Now we get cooking! This pic shows the tail added on and the more bulk being built. We get a little repetitive and build the craft up in this pic. And this pic from the instructions shows how the alien craft transforms for battle. The completed set and extra bits. Parts: 8/10 Figs 8/10 Price Per Piece ration: 9/10 Playability: 9/10 Overall: 85% The alien craft is great. The attack feature is nice and there are a ton of trans green parts. The alien falls out of the cockpit when turned upside down. I love this set, and it's perfect for MM fans or beginners.It has nice parts, and read the above part for more details. Gallery when Moderated. Keep an eye out for future reviews! Please comment. :-)

thanx for the review. i have one question. do these aliens have moving arms? as far as the set goes i think lego did a bad job on the alien ship. i dont think any of the alien ships look good in Mars Mission the human fanction got a lot better this year and i would have bought this buggy if it came by its self..

Sweet first pic review! *y* I got this set for a birthday present last year, and it is pretty fun overall. The alien ship in this set is actually one of my favorites. It just looks cool, and the way you can fold it out is really clever. The only negative for me is the cockpit of the mining unit. Not really because it isn't detailed, but because mine is top heavy, and keeps falling forward. It's kinda funny if you think about him driving along and then falling forward...but not funny at all when you're playing. |-/

Well, as bad a concept aliensvshumans is for a theme... I really do like this set. The human rover has nice parts for reuse, especially those oldschool space wheels. And despite those wobbly wings, I really like the alien ship. goes from a flying saucer-ish shape to a spread winged almost raven shape, very ominous and cool looking. Now that 'alien commander' is terrible... if I don't buy bionicle minifigs already, why would I be interested in that thing? Kinda wish they'd take the Drones from the retiring ExoForce theme and do them in green, they'd make nice alien robot things...

Hi! This is my forth (old-school) technic set review! Since blakbird pointed out that all my technic reviews are red, I chose a yellow dune blaster for today! just kidding. this set is red as it should be! (Don't worry my next reviews will be yellow and black... uhhh forshadowing... ;-) ) I will start with some facts! 277 elements and released in 1994 that's enough. #1: the box: #2: the parts: #3: building instructions and catalogues: Wow! No folds, no wear marks - simply: *wub* "Was lesen coole Kids?" - "KLICK! Das super Magazin fuer coole Kids!" (How obvious...) #4: building: No differential. I really love the way the 1x8 Technic Bricks on the sides will be positioned later. Fun fact: the engine contains no 2L-Technic Axle. ...and finished. A real quick build. #5: spare parts: ...for the alternate model. The yellow Technic Handle should be from 8412. Maybe a bonus feature from the seller! #6: random shots: #7: final thoughts: This is my second 8829 and I also noticed that the engine turns very hard. The alternate model is really (sorry to all those of you who like it) crappy. I mean- a nice idea, but not with this wheels! :-| Anyway: a really beautiful Technic-set! *reminiscing* (this word exists, does it?) thanks for viewing the pictures, I hope you enjoyed it!

I don't own the 8296, but what I can see from the pictures, I would say that 8296 is very similar to 8829. The only things that are different ist that 8296 is studless and features a steering wheel for the seat. But 8829 has got bigger wheels... >:-) It also would have been nice, if the wheels from 8296 could have the same tread.

Please comment if you want to! A great set review, as always. Nice try making a review of a set that was not red. It almost worked! Maybe next time. *sweet* One thing I noticed is that a bunch of your pictures are missing the beam that goes over the left hand wheel as a fender. Like this picture: What kind of camera do you use? The pictures have very good depth of field, meaning that both the foreground and the background are in good focus. This is usually hard to do without a very small aperture. Yes, "reminiscing" is a word. It means to fondly remember the past. I also noticed that the engine was sticky. Set 8408 has the same problem. It took me forever to figure out what the problem was. If you take the engine out of the model, it turns nice and smooth. Then when you put it back in, it works terrible. It turns out the key is that, in the back, there is an 8 tooth spur gear and a 24 tooth crown gear used as a spur. If you look at Technica, you will see that there are two different crown gears. One of them works well mated with an 8 tooth on parallel axles, and the other one doesn't. The difference is only supposed to be longer teeth, so it really should not matter, but it does. If your set works bad, try switching the crown gear to one of the other variety. Worked for me. Eric

First, 8829 is a lot bigger. I really like the huge rear balloon tires. They both have rack and pinion steering, and they both have trailing arm rear suspension with a V-2 engine. I think the body on 8829 is a little more well done. For 8296, I think the alternate tractor model is much better. For more comparisons, see Technicopedia. Eric

Hello All Apologize for digging out a such old post. Recently I got a bag of Lego Technic parts where there have been mixed three sets: 8858, 8829 and 8235 The resurrection of 8858 has been described by me in a separate post. Going back to the Dune Buggy – when I saw it for the first time back in 1994 I did not like it, as I was always big fan of 8840 (which I consider to the day the best looking Buggy) and set 8829 looked to me ugly. So there were those all parts in the bag… then I though why not build it ? And I started to do it. When I finished I was very surprised how the final look of this set is! Really taking my words back. Unfortunately in the bag there were missing some parts and I could not rebuild the back spoiler. So I made some changes to it and make it from spare parts that I have and it came out acceptable. I also added some additional parts such as “fake” steering wheel, “Rally” logo, antennas. I have also reverse mounting of the rear tires – why Lego did them like that I never know – as I think they look better this way. Set: well the review has been already made by owner of this post so I will only add few things into it. Engine – V2 (aired cooled?) is driven by 4 gears -> from the single wheel (no differential as in 8840) using two old school z14 tooth bevel , then by z24 tooth crown and z8 tooth type 1. Actually the (as in most old sets) the pistons are moving very fast (not as in current sets) and smooths – I needed to extra clean all engine parts as there was a lot friction. Suspension – set has “engine bay” working using two old gray shock absorbers 6,5l – the movement is not big but works very nice, better then in 8840 in my opinion. Steering – this is a bit odd as there is no direct connection to HoG as in most old sets, but first the gear rack is moved by z8 then two z14 tooth where reverse movement is taking place. Later connection of two old school z14 tooth bevel goes to HoG Details – this is the most that I like in this set, specially how the use of axle pin connector perpendicular and 1x10 bricks with 3x3 cut corners and plate 1x5 toothed ends 2 studs with center axle hole are making the body shape – is just wonder. Tires – the balloon rear are pretty nice the front is a new version of those that were in 8840. What I do not like: 1. Missing of Technic Figure (8840 had it.) 2. no steering wheel in the original set 3. no differential – but having in mind that Lego has introduce 24-12 teeth would be difficult to build the transmission in such small space where the engine is. I will shortly upload new pictures and post them here later on . Over all – I think it is worth buying it as it is very payable ! Actually very payable and runs smoothly , the steering, suspension – perfect Thank you and regards

WOW! This buggy was my very first LEGO set. I like this review - it remembered my childhood. I also liked its body with those 8 studs long bricks on sides. I can also remember trying to build engine in such way that it works smooth without success. Anyway I think its "studless version" - set 8048 is much better.

Finally, after a very frustrating incident with the Internet Explorer 7's 'Back' button, I present to you my very first review. This is a review of set 8158 Speed Racer Vs Snake Oiler, it's also the first review of a Speed Racer set on EuroBricks. Also you should know that I didn't put the stickers on as they can be quite valuable later on down the road, so I'm sorry for the lack of stickers. :-$ So without further ado I present to you my first review. He He, that rhymes. :-D EDIT: I just finished resizing the pics and uploading them to BrickShelf after having a heated argument about when my bedtime is with my mother. So, I will be doing a complete redo of the picture portion of my review of set 8158. I'm going to work on that as soon as I finish typing this message... EDIT 2: Review fully redone now, *sighs*, that took forever. EDIT 3: Almost forgot to put in a new link to its BrickShelf folder. This is V.2 of my review of set 8158, enjoy... Theme: Speed Racer Set:8158 Speed Racer Vs Snake Oiler Price: $19.99US Pieces: 242 Minifigs: 2 First off pics of the Box, Instructions, DSS, Minifigs, and New Parts: There are so many stickers they had to number them! X-O SO's sunglasses are chrome Gold. 8-? Close-up of the hemets. New parts include, First System Lego hubcap, new more curvy fenders, curved windshield, and a S-shaped connector piece. Now onto the Build, First Speed Racer's Mach 5: Back part of the car. The cockpit of the car. They connect with the new S-shaped piece. Front part of the car. Front and cockpit also connected using the new S-shaped piece. Side view of the car, so far. Underside of the car, so far. Adding more detail. Ground level front view of the car. Side view with added detail. Underside with newly added axles. Demonstrating how the new hubcaps are put on. Now on to building Snake Oilers Orange-ilicious racer: Back part of the car. The cockpit of the car. They are connected using the S-shaped piece. Front part of the car with seemingly random color choices. *wacko* The front and cockpit are also connected using the new S-shaped piece. Adding Orange-irific fenders. Side view of the car so far. Adding more detail. Smoothing things over. Ground level view with Lime Green "eyes" and white "fangs". Side view with more detail. Rearword view of the car with newly added cuve-acious windshield. No hubcaps!?! :-| Now onto finished views of both cars, First the Mach 5: Side view with sweet hubcaps. Up close and personal with the Mach 5. A rearend shot. "I got hubcaps, I got hubcaps!", Speed racer. Now SO's Snake Racer, yes thats what I'm calling it. :-P :-D Beautiful! Blurry, :-$ rearend pic. "Watchout it bites!", Snake Oiler He's ready to take on SR, Hubcaps or no hubcaps! >:-) Racin'! Now for some comparison shots: Hope you all like V.2 better then V.1, I know I liked it better. X-D Seriously though I even learned a thing or two doin' this last version. ;-) Now it's time for my summary: Overall a very well designed and executed set. It's only downfalls are that there are way too many stickers, 32 to be exact, :-| and there are no cool contraptions on the cars to take out the other racer. A great buy for $19.99, I reccomend this set to everybody because of the reasons I staed above and because even I, who is not a big fan of Speed Racer, X-O was drawn to this spectacular little set. Price: 10/10 Pieces: 8/10 Too many stickers. Minifigs: 9/10 Needed some accessories. Playability: 8/10 Needs some cool contraptions on the cars to take out the other racer. Overall: 35/40 General Tarful Edited by imperialshadows, 01 June 2008 - 12:07 PM.

I would like to comment on the review, but the pictures are too big - it simply takes too long to load. Regarding that new resize function. I can see it does "nearest neighbor" rescaling.

Thanks for the review, I think i'll certainly get these sets. They look very nice and have nice minfigs (I love racing, as long as minifigs could sit in them). The fact that there are so much stickers make me think this is an model building theme, like when you build plastic cars (with all those tiny pieces and a load of stickers).

Thanks for resizing the pics. It is strange that you didn't know about that Z-piece before. It was well used in old space sets. The cars are pretty nice, but I think the people sit way too high in them - the windscreen gives almost no protection. I am planning on modifying them to 7 studs wide since that's my current standard for this kind of race cars (Seriously!). Looking forward to the next review.

Hi! This is my forth pre-old-school review. As promised: a yellow-set ! My 8862 arrived today, survived the washing machine coaster and actually was real fun to build! #1: information: This set contains 664 parts (only! I thought I’d be far more!) and was released in 1989 in the TECHNIC theme. Be sure to visit Technopediaif you want to know more! #2: building instructions: Wow these instructions are used! I'm not used to this after all this sets with unread instruction booklets... The pneumatics page: The last step for the alternate model: #3: the parts: Wow! Look at all those technic beams, gears, pins...! (A few parts are missing in this photo!) #3: building: The left worm gear is for the outriggers, the right one for turning the “rear boom” The three 12L Axles: left one: outriggers, middle one: steering, right one: erm… rear-boom-rotation. The two worm gears in the front part: left one: lifting the bucket, right one: dumping the bucket. The turning-mechanism for the “rear-boom” is finished. Once again a toothed 10L axle. The Boat Weight 2x6x2 is hidden underneath the radiator grill. Okay… many hoses and a nice, comfy seat have been added. Now you can recognize the Backhoes real shape. Only with a little violence it’s possible to lift the bonnet (?) through the Pneumatic Pump. Yeah, outriggers. Same technique that the 8854 uses. The finished “boom / jib / scoop thing” (=BJST) :-| X-D The finished loader bucket. And to end the building process: the same picture from the introduction. (OFF-TOPIC: “It is all part of the miracle of nature! - The circle of life!” #4: functionality: This time, I tried something new! I hope you can spot something - if not: Technopedia! Okay, here we go. #5: random shots: I’ve got way too many pictures this time, so I refer to my brickshelf folder. Until it’s moderated you can follow the multilingual links! eins deux three quattro fem zes sédem osiem #6: final thoughts: Definitely worth buying! As a child I thought it looks hideous - but today I’ve found out it’s totally fun to build and freaking functional. Three things I want to mention though: The BJST can only be slewed (a new word!) if the outriggers are deployed. It is also possible that the BJST will reach the ground (danger of grinding or sticking) even if the outriggers are deployed. The two mechanisms for the loader bucket can actually interlock, and the 14 tooth gears might break / disentangle from the axle. thanks for viewing the pictures, I hope you enjoyed it!

Thanks for the review. It looks beautiful. My father was a backhoe driver, so understandably I used to drool over this set in the catalogs.

I'd love to see how they compare side by side... It looks bigger than 8455 but I don't own any of the big old chuncky tires so I find it so hard to tell. By the way, I have been reading all of your reviews but I have been a bit busy of late so I haven't had time to comment. I hope you have more planned; any chance of a supercar one?

Another nice review. The slow shutter speed pictures are great. I think that was the only set with 8 distinct functions for a very long time and was only displaced by the 8455 Backhoe in that respect. The turntable on the back doesn't turn very well though, as the weight is all distributed on one side. The screw axle prevents it from popping off but there is still a lot of friction in it. I don't have mine built anymore but it might be worth trying to put a weight brick or something on it. Quote Do you have 8455 as well? I'd love to see how they compare side by side... It looks bigger than 8455 but I don't own any of the big old chuncky tires so I find it so hard to tell. Yeah, it's quite a bit bigger. When everything is fully extended, it becomes something like 26" long. Although the 8455 actually has more/better functionality. Edited by CP5670, 24 March 2008 - 08:15 AM.

yeah, I meant they're rare. ;-) but I can imagine that a normal axle with the old half bushes will help. Sometimes these are really strong; if you put 2-3 in a row? EDIT: I just tried it: a normal 10L axle with 2 interlocking old half bushes type 1 on each end. (I chose those who only can be moved very hardly along an axle.) I slewed the BJST / back arm a few times tried the pneumatics parallel to it and it didn't loose. Edited by BerndDasBrot, 24 March 2008 - 06:06 PM.

I was thinking of getting one of those off BL several years ago, back when the price used to be more like $15 or so, but I realized that I hardly ever use the couple that I already have. :-P They came out with the modern turntable the year after this set, which mostly negated the need for these screw axles. I think their only use now is to hold non-Lego objects onto models, like the Technic pen in 8094. I guess you can try to make linear actuators out of them, but they're often too rare and fragile for that.

The finished “boom / jib / scoop thing” (=BJST) :-| X-D thanks for viewing the pictures, I hope you enjoyed it! Another great review and a wonderful set of pictures. I like your nomenclature for the BJST. Acronyms always sound nicely scientific; much better than "digger". No one would know you made it up until they found out what it means. I also really like what I will call your "kinetic photos". They convey a sense of motion and show the range of the mechanism without the big file sizes of animations. How long of a shutter speed did you use? The secret to not getting too much friction in the turntable is using extra nuts and jamming them together. You don't want to actually clamp the nuts tight across the turntable. You want to jam two nuts tightly together at each end which prevents them from unwinding, but still leave a little free play (gap). This way it will hold the assembly together but not prevent it from moving. Mine moves quite easily. This same concept is used on the pen plotter or 8094. "Slewed"? I think that's a word. How about "slewn" or "slain" or "slewifacated"? I think "rotated" is best. *sweet* Eric

By the way, don't forget to build the alternate model of 8862. It is a combine (farm equipment) which is just as good as 8274. I liked it so much that I bought two copies of this set so I could display both. My favorite alternate model (not counting Universal Sets) is the 8480 submarine. Maybe it is time for a white set review? *skull* White is pretty rare. For your blue set, I recommend you review 8462. There are only a couple of green sets, and 8479 is the best. And then of course, 8458 is silver!! I think we all know what the best black set is. And according to your photography, you have lots of them! But don't forget 8868. Eric

Although there are other ways of doing the same thing that don't use such rare parts, and the 2008 Technic sets will come with pre-built linear actuators anyway.

Quote How long of a shutter speed did you use? 15 seconds. Quote By the way, don't forget to build the alternate model of 8862. I will review it too and post it in this topic! Quote "Slewed"? I think that's a word. How about "slewn" or "slain" or "slewifacated"? I think "rotated" is best. actually I took it from your site! X-D Quote White is pretty rare. unfortunately I don't own 8480 but I think 8824 is also a very good (though small) white set! 8462 rocks as a blue set. I just got it a few weeks ago. Let's see... 8462 also is one of the last TECHNIC sets I would call Old-school. 8479... okay too, but 8458 is IMHO not. 8868 and the totally mysteriously black set will follow...! Quote I was thinking you could somehow attach a 16-tooth dark gray gear (the one that spins freely around axles) to the nut, which would make the axle move in and out when the gear turned and convert the gear's rotary motion to linear motion in a fairly compact package. Did you had something like this in mind? if the toothed 10L axle rotates the axle nuts want to rotate too but they can't because of that 2x4 Technic Plate. So they'll decide to move along the axle. The 1x6 Bricks on each end make sure that the axle won't move in or out. Thanks for your feedback!

That is unacceptable. It is imperative that you put a mortgage on your house immediately to get it! *sweet* Yes, 8824 is a good white set. I also see from your room photos that you have the 8839 Supply Ship which has lots of white. This is a really nice set. 8462 is hard to call old school, but at least it uses regular beams. The air tanks are the best part of the set. I wish LEGO had used them more often, especially on the highly pneumatic sets. The tank makes all the difference on 8459. You are right, 8458 is certainly not old school, but it is a great set with wonderful suspension. It is of the same era as the Super Street Sensation with all of the panels for body contouring. 8868 is Technic at its best. There is nothing else like it, especially with the compressor.

So they'll decide to move along the axle. The 1x6 Bricks on each end make sure that the axle won't move in or out. Thanks for your feedback! While the assembly you have drawn would work as a linear actuator, I would not recommend it. The torsional stiffness and strength of an axle are proportional to the polar moment of inertia, a section property. Most of the stiffness comes from the outside of the cross shaped axle. But in the threaded axle, you lose all the stiffness of the outer area because it is not continuous. This means you only get stiffness and strength from the small core. I think the threaded axle would bend and break very easily if subjected to much torque. Eric

Quote 8462 rocks as a blue set. I just got it a few weeks ago. Let's see... 8462 also is one of the last TECHNIC sets I would call Old-school. 8479... okay too, but 8458 is IMHO not. Yeah, the Tow Truck was the last set that still used mainly studded beams. They made many changes to Technic the following year, with models becoming predominantly studless and making heavy use of the flexible axles/hoses and decorative panels. The Technic logo and box art style was also changed a lot. I really like the overall construction of that set. The model is fairly lightweight but extremely sturdy. It must be one of the strongest large sets they've released. Quote Did you had something like this in mind? That's basically the idea. As Blakbird said though, it wouldn't be very powerful and would put the axle under some stress. The linear actuators they're bringing out this year do the same thing and should work much better.

I'm very sorry for that doublepost... I made a picture for you, sinner, but forgot to upload it: Your dad, Patrick Parrot, driving a giant backhoe. Sadly his second job as Photojournalist and the fact that Bianca Lamb was strolling by, distracted him. as a consequence he spoiled the whole construction site bringing death and doom with a Technic Backhoe to Fabuland.

Some time ago I sort of complained about the fact that there was not much Technic represented in the Eurobricks community (this was the topic, if someone is interested). I am glad to see someone took that complaint serious and started reviewing technic sets on large scale to show us how fascinating the theme really is! This review is once again an excellent one, I really enjoyed reading it. I must buy this set sometime soon because I always liked the three-way pneumatic system it came with and the overall look of the machine. For many years it seemed out of reach, much to expensive and hard to come by as a kid. Now as an adult there are many ways to acquire this wonderful set. Keep on reviewing! *y*

This is a review of Speed Racer set 8159 Raxer X Vs Taejo. This is my second review and the first review of this paticular set and the only one on EuroBricks... at the moment X-D So without further ado I present to you my review... (I like that saying so much I decided to use it again in this review, it's originally from my review of 8158, which can be seen here.) Note: Sorry that this review got delayed, but there was a hostile takeover of the computer, X-O don't worry everythings fine now. X-D Set: 8159 Racer X Vs Taejo Theme: Speed Racer Price: $19.99US Pieces: 237 Minifigs: 2 Note 2: I did not take photos of just the new pieces this time because they're the same "new" pieces as in 8158, just in diff. colors. If you want to see a picture of them click here. First off pictures of the Box, Instructions, DSS, and Minifigs: Not quite as many stickers as set 8158, but there still are quite a few. Can you guess which ones which? :-D Yes, Taejo's hair really is Red and Black, for Racer X's head TLG just reused the baddie's head from 7620. |-/ Now onto the build: First Racer X's X Racer :-D (Thats not it's official name.. I think.) :-$ Back end of the car. The cockpit, and yeah there are no seats for Racer X's hiny, just a flat 2x2 Dark Bley plate. The cockpit and rearend of the car connect using an S-shaped connector piece. The front part of the car. The fornt and the cockpit are also connected using an S-shaped connector piece. Adding some details including Yellow fenders. The underside of the car, so far. Adding some more detail. Newly added motor vents and smooth details. Adding a front bumper, amongst other things. Side view of the car, so far. "No backseat driving, wait a minute, there's no backseat!" The underside with newly added axles. Demonstrating how hubcap piece is put on the car. Now onto Taejo's GRR (Glorious Red Racer) :-P Front part of the car. Cockpit, regular seats... check. Cocpit and rearend of the car connected using S-shaped connector piece. Adding some detail. The front part of the car. Front and cockpit connected also using the S-shaped connector piece. Adding some fenders to the car. Underside of the car, so far. Adding some smooth details. Taejos is the only car with an actual hood. Side view of the car, so far. Underside of the car with axels. Now some finished shots of both cars: First Racer X's fine Black and Yellow racer Reminds me of an older Ferrari from this angle. Up close and personal. I'm guessing the 3 holes are exhaust outlets. Racer X rollin'. Now it's time for Taejo's Red racer "I could've sworn I ordered some hubcaps!" -guess who... Taejo Racer X admiring Taejo's fine red automobile. Up close with 'Big Red'. Rearend shot of the car. "I challenge you Racer X!" -Taejo Racer X bein' a complete badass and smokin' Taejo. >:-) Now for some comparison shots: (The Silver pocket knife is just to hold up Taejo's car.) Now a shot of the extra pieces: Now if you combine 8158 with 8159, you get this: "Go, Go, Go!" Now it's time for the summary: This set is an excellent buy at $20 dollars, it's well designed and has lot's of details, it also has very unique minifigs. (Which are always good in a set.) It's only downfalls are the lack of acessories for the minifigs and that there are no cool contraptions on the cars, and by "cool" I mean lethal to the other racer(s). Now to the scoring of the set: Price:10/10 Pieces: 8/10 Too many stickers for such a small set. Minifigs: 10/10 Unique and creative. Playability: 9/10 Would have been perfect except for the lack of acessories and cool contraptions on the cars. (But both are easily modified/fixed hence the nine.) Overall: 37/40 A great set! Bonus: Try and count how many times my Silver pocket knife appears and win... the knowledge of knowing how many times the Silver pocket knife appears. :-P :-D This concludes the review, more pictures of either set 8158 or 8159 or both available through request, via PM-ing me. ;-) See ya' next time folks... of course I don't mean that literally X-D ...

Thanks for the review, mate. I may get this as well, so I can get Racer X.

Speaking of pocket knives, I just got Speed Racer and Snake Oiler at K-Mart and might mod the helmet so it actually looks like the cartoon. The problem is - I don't want to shell out two bucks for a clear visor! >:-( By the way, I know trans-clear visors are non-production, but where did they come from? a pick-a-brick? if so, what store? Well at least if I do go through getting the elusive clear visor, it's not as bad as the insane $25+ red vader helmet! This set is great. I would have gotten this along with the one I purchased, but I didn't have enough dough with me to get both.

As promised, and with only a single day of delay is my review of the 2008 set: 4994 Creator Fierce Creatures. This small set is the same size and price range as last year's 4939 Cool Cars reviewed by prateek and dillthepill. The box General info You get 193 pieces (vs 206 for Cool Cars) which is quite a lot, but most of them are small. There are a lot of hinges and some good slopes and wings. The building instructions contains three models, but no further ideas for inspiration. Primary model: Spider The first model is a big spider which shares some similarities to the secondary model of 4895 Power in the design. The legs each have 3 joints, where the ones in the middle have "stud joints" to be moved sideways while the rest use hinges for all joints. There are 8 of them and it does get a little tedious with all the repetitive building in this relatively small model. I like the design of the face with a lot of eyes and a big and ugly mouth, but the real gem is the X-pattern on the opisthosoma made using double/inverted slopes. It is poseable and I think it looks more "fierce" when inverted. Secondary model: Snake The face of the snake is nicely detailed with a splitting tongue and a mouth than can move a little. There is a problem with the construction. It uses stacked hinges for some of the joints, which are hard to pull apart without stressing the pieces. Tertiary model: Fly I'm not completely sure what this insect is. I will say it's a fly, although the tail and head are too pointy. This is a neat little thing. Conclusion Primary model: 8 It is a good design, but lacks some sturdiness in the legs. They fall off a little too easily. Secondary models: 6 They are pretty good when you look at the bricks that are available, but they don't wow you in any way and they suffer from the same issues as the primary model regarding sturdiness. Alternate models: 3 It is hard to come up with alternate models with so many small pieces and plates that are only 1 stud wide. The colors might make you want to build a Spyrius space ship. Playability: 8 The models have many movable joints and you can put quite a scare into your minifigs when their town gets attacked by these creatures... unless some EN forces are there to protect them. Price: 6 Creator sets are known for their great price to bricks ratio, but this set doesn't quite measure up to sets like Cool Cars. Pieces: 7 The pieces aren't great by themselves, but who doesn't need a fist full of hinges, slopes and basic plates in standard colors? I don't think this is a must-have set like the big rig was last year. The pieces are great and it has a nice primary model, but the set lacks a bit when it comes to the usual strong Creator qualities like alternate models and price.

Enchanted Island 6278 Pictorial Review Original price: $66 Pieces: 412 Figures: 7 This 1994 set marked the beginning of a new era for Lego Pirates - it became a theme more centralised around playability and not so much grand ol' ships. 6278 Enchanted Island was the flagship set of the Islanders subtheme, heavily based around Polynesian and Native American concepts (In fact, TLC was successfully sued by a number of tribes for using bastardised Maori names, such as Kahuka). It was released as a Legend set in 2001, but due to poor sales was discontinued again. The largest of the Islander sets, Enchanted Island is a portion of an island with a river running through. The left hand side features some sturdy buildings built into a tree-like structure on a rocky outcrop, whilst the left hand side features a tower built out of "wooden" posts and a large tribal statue. The box cover shows all the details; it does, however, differ from the instructions' finished product in that it has been more aesthetically arranged - bushes e.t.c. have been moved to fill in gaps and to not obscure other things. The sides of the box show nothing particularly special, although in one scene it depicts the Islander Canoe chasing the Pirate boat with the treasure; just one way to play with the set. The back of the box, however, is superb, featuring a large number of alternative models: a toothy statue, a Pirate tree (think Wolfpack) with an Islander base, Kahuka's throne, a fire-breathing statue and a souped-up boat for the pirates. These, and many more, can be easily made because of the large diversity of pieces. The set has a huge number of minifigures for its size, the third highest number in the Pirate range (The SES and the BSB being first and second, respectively) - a whopping 7! 5 Islanders, including the all-too-common King Kahuka, the elusive Islander babe and 3 standard warriors - this set alone will never leave you short of enemies! 2 pirates, Ironhook in his standard attire with a scurvy dog at his side attack the island, although they are only moderately armed - 2 cutlasses and a pistol between them; a musket would've been nice. The Islanders, on the other hand, have 4 shields, a bow and quiver and 6 spears, not to mention the big pokey thing with horns on top (Weapon? Idol? Staff?). A monkey, parrot and crocodile provide the obvious creature features, with a fair amount of gold to finish off. In the instructions, the goblet does not have the lid, although it does on the box; it's a nice touch anyway - adding a little more diversity to the monotonous treasure stashes. The pirates' boat is a nice 2 sail vessel, with oars for when the wind stops and a treasure map. The sails are similar to those in Lagoon Lockup, but with an extra front sail. It's an awesome little boat, better for raids than a rowing boat, but not too big that it can't sail up rivers. It can comfortably fit 2 men and, at a squeeze, 5. The sails are expensive if you buy them seperately; normally this won't be a problem, but they can cost aroun $5 each. The Islanders' boat is a canoe with a sail and an outrigger to stabilise it. The sail is beautifully done, with 2 spars taughtening it. There is a clip for the rower to leave his weapon when at se and the mast can turn to get as much wind as possible. It's quite a top-heavy boat, but it doesn't look hideous and without the mast/sail it looks great. 3 Islanders can fit in it, and more if they sit on the outrigger. The markings on the canoe are stickers, but they look fine and are probably more robust than markings for their job. Furthermore, they're waterproof! *sing* Kahuka's throne can be carried by 2 loyal subjects... ...Or strapped to his pet crocodile! The clips on the side can be used to rest his weaponry, or hold spears for battle. The throne looks nice, although I'm not too sure about the blue against the red - I'd have prefered white as it would clash less... An overview of the island; it is built in 2 halves - left then right and then joined together loosley, so it can be seperated for transporting. Around the back to the left and right, there are large open spaces that are great for battles - this set isn't so much about a large solid build, but creating a "village" - smaller structures linked by bridges. And the back... To the far left is a platform built onto the rock, with access from the river via a ladder. There's the standard Islander drum with the lovely zebra-skin part (Where did they get that?!). I've never understood the white flag - I was under the impression it was used for surrender... Further along the rocky bank, there are some hinged palm leaves that swing upwards to reveal... ...The treasure! It's an OK hiding place; not the best place to hide it, right where the pirates sail past, but it feels fabulous; it fits right in. Above it on the rocky bank is the main structure. It looks very disjointed when you build it (bricks all over the place), but once it's done it looks nice and rural, with leaves everywhere and the "balcony" where Kahuka is standing. You get a nice roof made from 2 large palm leaves tilting down. Around the back there's a slight shelter, a table for picnics and a ladder to access the upstairs. I was rather annoyed that it is so open, but the set is designed from just one perspective... To the left is the bridge to the other building... A nice, one piece bridge made of the softer plastic used for muskets and the post-1991 cutlasses. It looks good, but be warned! It tilts when you pull a pin, sending the pirates flying! This contraption is a good idea, but it is very stiff and so doesn't swing, even when burdened by a minifigure - you'll want to modify this bit if you get it. The other building looks like it is made out of posts and beams. They are all red; brown would have been better, but it would have added too many colours to the range, just like the use of black for trees in some forestmen sets. There are 3 clips for spare weapons; only 2 of these will ever be used when all the Islanders are armed, but it gives the pirates scope once they've been disarmed...There's another nice palm tree roof on top. 2 ladders give access...there's a total of 4 in this set - worth getting, eh? Although they're 5p on Bricklink, for a KABOB, they're like gold! At the top there's another hidey hole; the palm leaves lift up on hinges to show the treasure or hiding Islander. It can be seen from behind, but this set is designed from one perspective only. Nice cattlehorns too...alongside the slats you can see in the floor - 5 years later and it would've been a solid plate... The big statue is one of the main selling point of this set, alongside the tilting bridge - they're the action features shown in every catalogue at the time, but it is not really special, just original. The statue fits in with the theme perfectly - Kahuka's mask, his shield and this statue all depict the same deity, which is a nice "collectible" idea. The back is rather plain, except the angled 1x1 bricks - a good touch. I'm not sure why there's a black brick in the back of the head, but this is easily remedied; it could even be done with a brick from this same set, just swapping the two over... Aside from the head turning, the back can open to store sacred objects, or, in my opinion, prisoners, hence the gaps for breathing. Either way, it's a lovely piece of architecture and deservedly a flagship element of the set. There's your standard cooking pot floating around, although a 1x1 yellow stud as human flesh (remember, minifigs are yellow, no matter what the licensed themes say!) is a superb finish. This set is a stunning set for both kids and AFOLs who are just getting back into Lego/Pirates - it is a great army builder and, due to its release as a Legend, is extremely cheap on eBay - you should be able to pick one up for £18, or £15 if you're lucky. For that you get a lifetime's supply of Islanders, 4 ladders, some wall panels, 2 baseplates (one raised and both with rivers and printed vegetation around the edge), a ton of weapons, a fair quantity of standard bricks, but most of all, a heap of vegetation: This is an easy to buy set, with normally around 5 on eBay at any time, and is well worth it, for the parts, the play and the nostalgia! It can be easily modified; when used in conjunction with any other outpost, a much larger fortress can be made, especially if more rope bridges are used. if you pick 2 of this fine set off eBay (It'll still be less than the original price!), a huge complex can be constructed, giving you an instantaneous village for around £35.

Excellent review! *y* Getting a better chance to look at this set actually makes me interested in it. I was in my dark ages throughout the Islander days, though I have built up a small force of them (10?) from eBay buys, but no actual sets. If this is really as reasonable as you say there, I may just have to pick one up soon. Oddly, I do own the baseplates to this set, having also picked them up in a lot on eBay, so I might be able to recreate it manually, but I think I'd rather pick one up whole. It looks like a great mix of parts and makes a decent looking display piece. Thanks again for the fine review! *y*

Thanks for a lovely review! I only recently bought this set off Ebay (pretty good deal: MISB for 30 euro's!) and I enjoyed putting it together and mixing it with the other Piratesets. When you put two sets of two baseplates together you'll get a large pond with an island in the center, just to achieve that I bought two more baseplates off Ebay. The result is this MOC. I always loved the Islanders and have most of the sets, not all of them but that is going to change in the future. *y*

Excellent review! I really like this set and so I gave it a 5/5. This set is on my list to get. I especially like the speedy pirate boat, and the also very fast outrigger canoe with a sail. I don't think a small number of these cannibals will make much of an impact on gaming though, even if they get a bonus with spears. Duke

Nice review ( although I'm pretty sure Eldorado Fortress has 8 minifigs, making this set no 4 in the minifig count.) I gave it a 5. The number of islanders and vegetation pieces comes in very handy for land based scenarios. I've got 3 copies of this set, 1 of them costing me less than 2Euro's from an ebay auction in Scotland. Along with Forbidden Island it's easily one of the most common and affordable pirate sets to be found on he second hand market.

A great and informative review with very fine pictures, thanks SlyOwl! *sweet* A wonderful set this is indeed, full of nice details and pretty playable, and a cool subtheme that offers a lot of fantasy and charming characters in a marvelous layout. I really love that little boat with the outrigger, and the neat buildings and sweet landscaping works together very well. TLC got sued for using some names of native sounding origin? Now that sounds really strange to me.... such names´re widely spread within novels, movies and such stuff, I didn´t know that there´s some kind of copyright on them.... 8-|

Good review, mr. SlyOwl! And good pics too! I know it probably deserves better but I only give him a 3. I'll be surely the only saying that I don't like this set but I remember I had it for christmas when I was a child and it disappointed me very much because I expected it much larger after seeing it in the LEGO catalogs. Well it's just a little trauma I had :-P LOL Anyway I must admit it's an interesant set, specially because of the large number of mini-figures and accesories it brings with and the two little "ships" Edited by BlueBard, 31 March 2008 - 01:13 AM.

It's a great set and one I have yet to add to my collection despite my large number of Islander extras. Enchanted Island, aside from having so alluring a name was good value for money in that you only needed this one set and you had a good representation of the islanders both in the size of the set and the number of minifigs. The flipping rope bridge and the river give it a great rainforest retreat sort of feeling and one is inclined to think of this set as more inland than directly coastal for me. Whilst the Islanders were never seen in the same light or popularity as Pirates and Imperials they were an obvious and colourful addition that to me added a whole new depth to the Pirate system and one was now able to play a 3 or 4 way war adding a greater political element to the sets. Enchanted Island is probably the 3rd most appealing of the large land bases for me after Port Royal and Eldorado Fortress. Good review and glad to see the set recognised!

Hello Eldiano. Although the review is fine and you have memories related to that set please have in mind that the post you were replying to was in fact some 7 years old.

Eldiano, thank you for posting about your desire to have this set. I do own the set, and I do recommend it to others if they somehow find a used one. The bricks are kind of sparse, but the the bricks it does come with are really nice, I love the figs, and the base plates are by far my favorite made by TLG. Captain Braunsfeld, I suggest that you read through the link that covers topic bumping more clearly. I apologize for the confusion Eldiano. I do believe that I have found a way to remove the confusion of posting in old topics soon among the Pirate Staff and to the other members of EB, please stay tuned. Sinner, on 18 July 2010 - 03:16 AM, said: 3. LEGO reviews don't date. Thus if you have something relevant to say then feel free to post in a topic, but if it's more than a few months old please make sure it's good.... and if it's been a few years it better be really good! For example, if you liked the review or set and want to say so you probably shouldn't. If you've got an answer to a question (such as "Does anyone have pictures of the alternate model?) then by all means post! What you shouldn't do is ask questions to the original poster; he/she may not even visit EB any more.

Fortunately I got this set on 2000 (not the released version, the original one). And I said "fortunately" because it's a lovely set. How could I rate it, but awesome? A little Islander "army", the islander girl, Ironhook and that cool boat with two sails, the jail-polynesian statue. I must recognize that I have a thing with the Islanders. I know that they are weird, poorly based on the polynesian aborigens, etc. But they are very original, broke with the traditional enemies, and gave to the Pirates theme an exotic and wild look.

I realized that building the chess set from the new pirates theme, they are two grey heads that reminded me of the king kahuna throne, which goes to say that I am hoping they bring back new sets, I just wish they were bigger. I would love to build the old ones, but I would side more towards the newer model if they ever released them.

What an amazing (old) set! I loved Pirates in my childhood, but that was before the Islander and Spanish stuff... mine were the BSB and soldier fortress with the big baseplate. As I'm now returning to Pirates, I've tracked down most of the 2009 sets and of course bought the new 2015 sets... but knowing I missed this "middle" period of Islanders vs Pirates makes me a bit sad... those Islanders are soooo "Monkey Island" (those of my age likely feel the same) to my eyes! Oh for a "Lemonhead" minfig... ;) I'm curious now how much this set sells for, given it was apparently one of very few Lego actually re-released! I recently bought a MISB BSB that was an early 2000's re-release, and it was very pricey... but then, I suspect the BSB has a LOT more of a nostalgic following these days than this set! Can anyone give me a rough idea what this set goes for in as-new condition these days? Regardless, a fantastic review with some great photos of the whole set and minifigs... even though this is an old thread, I am glad someone else bumped it recently so I can add my thoughts too. :) One thing I've noticed comparing the newest Pirates sets to the 80's ones I had as a kid (and these from the 90's) is the move away from baseplates and big "panel" pieces. I actually like that in a lot of ways; whilst I miss baseplates being included as they are a great starting point for creating new things (and make the sets easier to "play" with), visually, I think Lego-designed model sets look better without them.

Sorry to bump such an old thread, but I´ve just discovered this set is on sale at Amazon.de - for a mere 25 Euros. I am tempted. Not because I like the set or the models, but because of the parts. As most of you might know, I´m especially into Exo-Force. So would you recommend to get this set just for the parts? Are they a good choice to combine with EF-sets? Would anyone of you be interested in obtaining the fleshie-parts of the minifigs from me, as I totally don´t need those?

I picked up this set a few weeks ago (along with the smaller sets that come with the Mach 5 and Racer X's car), and I was pleasantly surprised. The commentator's stand is nothing to write home about, but the assortment of figs is great (numerous new face prints in flesh, I believe), and in spite of the large amount of stickers, the three cars are each unique and very well-designed. My only gripe about them is that Cannonball Taylor's car (the black and yellow one) was a missed opportunity, as in the movie it's yellow and purple. I know TLC is dropping purple for the future and had a bunch of problems with it in the past, but it would have made for a great looking car IMO.

Hi! I've promised a lot lately. I'll review 8868, 8880, Space Police II, Blacktron II... And I WILL. It's just the time that is blocking me. And my university. And the fact that I just picked up 8460 in original box for only EUR 36,50...! *sweet* The other reviews will follow - please bear with me. And this set review is also a gift to this nice fellow who gave me the title! That's what I'm talking about: #1 useless information with high numbers: This set contains 841 parts and was released in 1995 in the TECHNIC / Tech Build / Advanced (sub-) theme. The bricklink price guide displays for “Used” a Qty Avg Price of $125.85 and for “New” a Qty Avg Price of $212.82. I got it for $56,98. Still can’t believe it. :'-) This set was rereleased two times (8431 in 2002 and 8438 in 2003). #2 the box: Front: Back: Open: The box is higher than other Technic boxes. Why? I don’t know. 8460 doesn’t have any real large parts. Whatever. Inlay: I wonder why TLG doesn’t make inlays anymore… They’re noisy and brake easily but are great for (pre-) sorting. #3 building instructions: I will quote myself from the 8862 review: Quote Wow these instructions are used! I'm not used to this after all this sets with unread instruction booklets... Triple-wow! ‘nuff said. This is the “first” page. (Fortunately Peeron offers scans!) The last step for the alternate model and a few nice photos showing how the pneumatic pump will be erm- pumped. Yeah. Random page: I forgot the overall thoughts to the instructions: These are Technic instructions as we’re used to them: part count, easy to understand (okay, the string part at the end was too much for me) and the color distinction is okay too. 100 pages long and if I can trust my eyes the pneumatics page can be fold out. (I don’t have this page but I assume it.) #4 the parts: #5 building: An easy and fun build. Okay, this could take some time. My longest building review up to date. The front steering: The rear steering. The axle pin between the rear steering is for the axle which rotates the crane. The two worm screws in the front are for the outriggers (they’re not linked. One for each side.) The small wheel in the back is for the rotation. Adjusting front and rear steering. outriggers are finished. You can notice a 8 tooth gear that will rotate the Technic Turntable. A steering wheel has been added. Could be the same stickers like the alternate 8880 used to have. The steering can be operated with both actinic lights (?) No. We’re far from finished. I’ve got a lot of parts left at this point. Wow. A 4x4 corner plate! Pneumatics and a winch: If you can’t recognize it on the photo: The Technic Beams are the erm- wrong/other side up. The 1x6 Technic Beams on the left side are normal. The axle that will extend the crane: 7 gear racks 1x4 the 1x6 Technic plate will keep the two pneumatic cylinders straight. *sad* 8-| Huh? Did you blink? You missed a special part: The whole rotatable thing will be attached to the Technic turntable using two long Technic pins. The pin on the right side should be in the middle of the three “turntable holes”. On the right side, it’s the first hole. Asymmetric! Why? Because we’ll add a cute cab! #6 functionality: You can find the features in comparison to other Technic cranes here. Technopedia, of course. I made one "sentence" out of it: (please don’t find any mistakes.) :-P “two axle rack and pinion steering, pneumatic luffing and gear driven telescoping via crank for the boom which can slew 360° on turntable driven via gear, crank driven hoist and gear driven outriggers at four corners which snap over center.” #7 random shots: Comparison to 8854: uuuh… once again a depth of field. I tried to make it look authoritarian like 8858 but I failed. Somehow 8460 looks cute. #8 comparison to 8421 Mobile Crane / Crane Truck: I feel that a question concerning this will be asked, so I deal with it right now. First of all: I don’t own 8421 yet. I know. A Technic freak really should own it. Anyway: 8421 has more than twice as much parts as 8460, is motorized, features a V6-engine and a very neat mechanism to extend the crane/boom twice using a braided string with end studs. Try to find out how! Of course 8421 features (far) more than 8460. IMHO 8421 should have been a copy of 8460, a set so successful that it has been rereleased two times, but the designers overshoot the mark. 8421 is a (breathtaking) monster. Compared to it, 8460 looks cute - not pale! #9 final thoughts: I got it on eBay in kind of good condition, for about 50 dollars. I know that it has been worth the money in any point of view. *wub* I didn’t use the word “old-school” for now. I’ll change that: 8460 belongs to the favored few of old-school Technic sets! thanks for reading and viewing the pictures, I hope you enjoyed it! Please comment if you want to!

Somehow I competely missed your review when you first made it, I saw your pics on brickshelf and wondered about the review... You have managed to review my all time favourite technic set! It was the first large Technic set I was given by my parents, when it first came out in 1995. I played for hours with this set, making minifig seats in it (it was so huge there was room for four minifigs to sit next to eachother in front....) I made various applications for it, a bungee-jump system with a large rubber band, and lots of containers to be lifted. The first changes I made included the inverting of the wheels and the disabling of one of the flashlight-steering wheels because they obstructed eachother. By the way, the nob for your winch is yellow instead of black (I know this set by heart, so watch out :-P ). I always liked those nobs. I do own the 8421 and I can tell you: this 8460 is much, much stronger, it can carry more weight because the boom is lighter then the 8421: they are powered by the same two pistons... You know when you made it right: when the crane is in upright position, fully extended and you release the brake from the winch. Does the hook lower without having to pull it? If it does, you succeeded in constructing the set right. The alternate model was great fun too, the pump is cleverly hidden and the crane folds up great between the cab and the loading platform. You could easily mod it with a pneumatic claw on the crane, a motor to turn it and a compressor. The only flaw was the loading platform which had no floor (only some axles). Thanks so much for reviving my memorie concerning this great set! *y*

I'm in the same situation as you; I have this set but missed out on the newer 8421. This was a great set for its time but the 8421 definitely looks better to me. I've been trying to find a good deal on it on ebay but it's pretty expensive, considering that it only went out of production last year. Quote Inlay: I wonder why TLG doesn’t make inlays anymore… They’re noisy and brake easily but are great for (pre-) sorting. The box designs in general are crappier these days than they used to be 10 years ago. You don't see the old "featured parts" trays anymore and the boxes don't have the different sections either (these also acted as internal supports for larger boxes, so they were less prone to being crushed). The cardboard material is also quite a bit thinner. I think it's a result of TLC's overall cost-cutting moves since then. Most people toss the boxes and probably don't care, but I keep all of them. There was actually a time when the boxes used to be even stronger. I have an old 8859 set and the outer box is made of a hard, styrofoam material, although they probably stopped using that for environmental reasons. Edited by CP5670, 06 April 2008 - 10:13 PM.

A great review, thank you. I do not know these old sets like this one, but it is very cool to see how they were made. I have an un-opened 8421, maybe I should do a small review of that when I get to build it. btw. boxes are expensive, so at a given price point, it's a choise between more bricks or nicer boxes. I have no doubt what most people would chose. Front Edited by Front, 06 April 2008 - 10:21 PM.

Thanks for the review. *sweet* For it's size and parts count this is a remarkably featured set. I don't think I've never seen the alternate model before. Personally I prefer 8421 because I think it looks much better and I love the six wheel steering. I also love the three segment boom and the transmission; they fit it all in so neatly. I realise that it has trouble even holding up itself, but ultimately it doesn't matter as it's not like you are really going to construction work with it. What bothers me more about 8421 is the design change in the boom from chainlinks to strings. I would try to mod mine but all I have is the prototype picture to base it on... and I don't have enough links anyway! :-P BerndDasBrot, on Apr 7 2008, 07:29 AM, said: yeah, somehow I wonderd why only VBBN (thanks!) responded...

Somebody (I haven't got the time to look :-$) on Brickshelf has made a quite good alternate. Lego have been a bit inconsistant with alternate models lately. The recent tow truck had a good one; I even made both!

Great review! While I admit I wasn't into Technic at the time this came out (I was a mere child, give me a break! :-D), I can see now why it was featured so much. From the booklets to display stands at toy stores and at my local LEGO center (when it was still around), this thing was everywhere! With your review, I can now truly appreciate all the details of the set. I got to admit, I can see the appeal now! That comparison shot you took is amazing. I love not only just how it included the little details such as the stabilizers, but also looks incredibly fun to play around with. Great set and an even greater review!

thanks guys! @ sinner: i hope you refered to 8285 so my answer will match: 8285 is interesting: main model: american styled truck, alternate model: european styled truck. I don't think TLG produced many european styled truck. EDIT: I just found a wonderful MOC-alternate on brickshelf: 8436 by industrialdesigner. If I got him right, he designed a few offical technic sets for TLG. @ all: promises, promises, promises... hm. and again it's eBay that's blocking me.

Set ref: 7624 Name: Jungle Duel Number of minifigs: 3 Number of pieces: 78 Price: 11,90€ It’s the smaller set from the last Indy movie, “the kingdom of the crystal skull”. Here we go! A general view of the set: We have a tent, some food ( a chicken leg is always welcome!), a fireplace, the things with all the swords, a bench with a broken table, 3 ants, a map (printed tile) and other accessories. Don’t make that girl hungry or... YYYYAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH! Ho no! Our diner, a giant ant, has gone away! Those giant ants are made in a smooth plastic, in dark red and trans black colour: And here a closer view on the two new hairpieces: The new girl hairpiece is really cute, and I’m a bit disappointed by the new man hairpiece…Those hair lake some volume… But I’m really happy to see that TLC has made some new moulds for hairpieces! It’s the good part of the theatre lines! So, it’s a really interesting set because you’ve got a lot of useful pieces for a city Mocers, with the two new hairpieces without spending a lot of money!

OK! I think, it''s a no-brainer that this is a must-have for pretty much anyone who likes LEGO! It's cheap and a great minifigs & parts pack! I'll be getting at least 1 of these! Here is what I like about it: 1. Great minifigs with nice torsos, sweet faces, and awesome hair! (Gotta ask 'em where they get it done! ) 2. Golden katana! 3. Chicken leg! YUM! 4. Nice campfire! And this is what I don't like about it: 1. Dark bley knife! Seriously, they could have at least made it silver like the sword, if not chrome! 2. Rehashed tent. 3. Spiders with 6 legs!!! I actually don't really care about the tent and the multi-legged creatures. Those go straight into the sorting boxes. Perhaps I might use the tent someday for a steampunk MOC of some kind, or a stop-motion film, or maybe some kind of contest... Anyway, what's up with that thing that holds the katana, the sword, and the saber? It's in the airplane set too! Is it perhaps one of the treasures of the new movie or is it something Indy takes with him everywhere in this film? 44However, nice pics, nice review! Thanks, dude!

Set ref: 7625 Name: River Chase Number of minifigs: 4 Number of pieces: unknown Price: 22,90€ A general view of the set: We’ve got an amphibious vehicle, a small boat, an observation post and a dark green croco (so beautiful! ). For the figs, we’ve got Indy of course, Marion and two Russian soldiers, nothing special here. In the back of the tree, there is a box, to put some things: The amphibious vehicle is very nice! The proportions are really great (not too big, not too small) and there are a lot of details everywhere, like the propeller: A back view: An inside view: The small boat is a dark grey Zodiac, but the details are nice too, giving it a retro look, in the same way of all the Indy vehicles: The outpost has a net to permit to the bad guys to capture some nice guys and girls… But it seems that the girl Marion is scared of the nice croco! So Indy comes and help her pushing the Technic axle with this round inversed tiles, which push out the net and capture the croco. Now Marion feels happier! And she takes a can of oil and whacks the poor croco, without defences! Who has said Marion is a nice girl? So, I’ve bought this set like an add on to my city. In fact, the elements of this set can easily be integrated in a town layout. I plan to use the outpost for my forest section, and the amphibious vehicle is always a nice touch of originality in a layout. Yes you can use all those military things without creating an army in a layout: just put the violent parts out, and you’ve got nice things, like a biologist car in the case of the amphibious vehicle!

Sweet review again, Alex! Great pictures, I loved the little comic with the croc. You're quite right here too: alex54, on Apr 16 2008, 09:17 AM, said: Yes you can use all those military things without creating an army in a layout: just put the violent parts out, and you’ve got nice things, like a biologist car in the case of the amphibious vehicle! Without the gun, that vehicle is a nice little amphibious car with a tent (I assume) strapped to it, some tools, a spare tire... The little tree hut is quite cool, and a nice touch with the box in behind there. I love the design for those gasoline cans too. Thanks again, Alex! You're lucky to be getting these sets! ~Peace

Thanks for the review! I really like this little-ish set, quite alot of detail, it reminds me of sets from the late 90's More Soviets are always welcome too, and the new torso for Marion is nice, as is the new dark green alligator All of the neat little accesories are great too, a cup, shovel, binoculars and of course the cans of gasoline Again, thanks for the review, alex

Great review Alex After seeing these pics i'm really looking forward to getting this set, i really like how lego has designed the gas tank that's just so good. Finally a different shade of green for the croc, it's about time and more than welcome. The vehicle looks good and a fun build, though i'm not that fond of that commie tree

Merci Beaucoup for the great review Alex !! Where did you get the sets ? That set is called River Chase This is a great set !! I love the amphibious vehicle with all the darj green part !! I agree with you that the the dark green croc is fantastic !! I'm also happy to have a dark bley Zodiac and a new Marion Torso. That "tree hut" is a fun feature where the playability doesn't screw the design !! I really love the commies !! Its fun how Lego reuses those fleshie heads and I really don't mind at all. So its evil for evil since one of the commie has the zazi face I also love the ptrol cans !! ingenious !! I still have rants on that set: * Why oh why another similar Indy !! Arghhh I can't stand it !! * Why oh why the same Marion head !! Can't wait to have those sets !!

A very fine review of a really great set, thanks alex! This set has everything, a croc, very nice MFs, a neat tree trap, a cool zodiac and a marvelous and very detailed amphibious car in a beautiful color scheme. The only thing I´m not colpletely sure is the design of that jerrycan (thanks for the right word and the interesting link, Kingboy ). Although the use of the revolver´s pretty clever indeed and fits well too, it´s still clearly, well, a revolver.... very unusual and interesting for an official TLC design.

Set ref: 7626 Name: Jungle Cutter Number of minifigs: 4 Number of pieces: unknown Price: 39,99€ A general view of the set: We’ve got 5 giant ants, two Russian soldiers, a General, Indy of course, 3 trees, a small entrance of a cave, and the debroussaillor vehicle (I don’t know the English name of it…). You can’t enter into the cave, because there is a spider web with its spider…Unless… Unless you know how the mechanism works and the spider web go up… And reveals a case with diamonds and accessories. A closer view on the mechanism (which is simple but works well), and you can also see the difference, or maybe the same, size of a spider and a giant ant! And I’ve always thought that those spiders were very big compared to the minifigs! So those ants are really giant! Poor small frog! The three trees with the entrance make a nice jungle layout! Don’t speak too loud, you will wake up the soldier… Don’t worry for him, he will be waken up by the vehicle before being eaten by those giant ants! A front view, making the vehicle really menacing! A back view: Push the red part from the back and there are two parts that fall down from the vehicle. I don’t know why… The movie will clarify this I think… And here you can see how the two big circular blades turn when you push the vehicle… Simple but effective! Run Indy, run! This set is really nice. The playability of the different elements is great, the colour scheme is nice too (I like those dark green tree parts!). The vehicle is really impressive without being too big and its very well details! In general the designers of the Indy sets have made a really nice works, with a lot of efforts in all those details everywhere! I’ve got some project for this set, to integrate it in my city... I’m a city mocer, and not an Indy fan. So I don’t have bought the temple, the bigger set of the series, because it has nothing special for me in term of part selections or in the design, in relation with the town theme, and because my supermarket doesn’t have it yet! So, we are waiting for a member to review it and make the part 4…

Great review, thanks a lot for all the pics. I agree that this is probably the nicest set of the Indy 4 wave. So much dark green and I love all the plant pieces. It's been ages since we've had enough pieces in a regular release to build nice forests so it's great to see 11 of the dark green leaves in one set and all the vines! The design of the cutter looks very solid and brick built as well. Giant ants are great looking too.

The figs are nice too; two Russian soldiers, the cool-looking general (I think his name is Dovchenko or something) and the repeated-but-still-nice Indy with RPG. Thanks again, looks like I'll be picking this up along with Jungle Duel. (By the way, I think this set is called Jungle Cutter).

Thanks for this fantastic review, Alex! Those trees are a neat add on to any jungle, as is that sweet cave. But the main part of this set, the Jungle Cutter, man, that is wicked! Packed with that awesome dark green and with those wonderful treads, not to mention the smoothly spinning buzz saws. However, this set's a tad overpriced in my opinion, and looking through the instructions they have that crazy colour syndrome again, using blue, yellow and red parts in the internal build. Still, thanks for this sweet review with neat pics! *thumbup* ~Peace

Thanks for the review alex I agree that this is the best set of KotCS sets (although the airplane comes quite close..). Although I'm not too fond of the trees, the cave is good, and the jungle cutter is brilliant. Plenty of great features, and very detailed, with much of the engine showing and a decent cockpit (if that's the right word..). The general and the two Soviets are great too (could we have a close-up pic of them please? ), good to see that neither torso has exposed fleshy skin like the Nazis. As said though, it is quite a pricy set, I was expecting it to be just over the price of Race for the Stolen Treasure. Great set, thanks again, alex!

Ahhhhh now this swamp vehicle looks great to me, when i first heard lego were making it i was worried that it would be a poor version. However im pleased to see that it's not, even though i'm not a great fan of those treads. The trees don't really add anything to the set which is a shame, still the parts are welcome at least. The entrance is good though it could do with being bigger, but i guess we can moc that. I really like the commie general, he looks like a real bad megablocks

This is the 3rd review, that i had read. It's very tempting to fly over and get those sets from there. Because, i may need to wait for some months before it arrived. It seemed we will have a new small little creature to add into the ranks. These "Red Ants" is cute and of course looks nasty too. Haha. I love those trees, foilage and plants very very much. It can be used for my MOC and is good for any "Green" project related expansion. I love it. About the vehicle, i find it abit wierd. It seemed too big in the set-up. Hehe, but still i love this set.

Here's a review of the second largest set in the Dragon Masters subtheme for castle month, Dark Dragon's Den! Figs: The set comes with 3 Dragon knights, two of which have the dragon wings on their helmets(Sad thing is, one of my knights was missing the left wing on the helmet). There are also the definitive dragon, Wiz the wizard (or Majisto if you prefer)two horses, and a hawk( try to find him in each picture!) The set: there's a large spot under the mountain for the dragon to guard the treasure chest. The chest has 2 red and green 1x1 circles in it. Another gate in the back, along with a door for knights. The right side of the mountain has a ladder and a removable rock face. The left side has some stairs leading up to the top. I love this tree design. simple yet effective. A shot of the top- Hey, what are you doing?!? NO!! Throw him in the dungeon! Overall: This set when first released in 1993 was priced at $43USD, although that might just be because of the Juniorised pieces (6 BURPs!). It's a fun set that provides excellent playability. If you can find it at a $20-$30 price point, pick it up. Overall grade: 8/10 Edited by KimT, 10 August 2008 - 01:33 PM.

Ah, the wonderful Dragon Knight (Or was it Dragon Masters?) sets. I personally preferred the Black Knights, but these guys still had some awesome sets! Thanks for this review, this looks like a neat little set, although those modern stairs look a little out of place. That tree design is indeed a neat one, I remember having that in one dark Forestmen set I got. The interior sure is roomy.

the wizard somehow "controls" the dragons i think, like, for example the wizard of the new castle line does with the undead skeletons. but i think it isn't sure that the dragon master's wizard is evil. as it is still unclear which factions of the older castle series are "good" or "bad".

I always liked the BURPs, I don't know why. Maybe because they were dark grey and dark grey pieces seemed a bit hard to come by at the time. I always assumed that the dragon was, sort of, the mascot of the Dragon Masters. The wizard was there to keep him under control so he wouldn't turn on them. I always figured that the wizard was working with the Dragon Master King, and they were fighting against the Royal Knights (the dudes with the lion faces on their torsos), or whatever they were called. I like this set a lot. I think the castle theme declined after the Dragon Masters and Royal Knights themes were discontinued. The new knights never really took the cake. It's funny, but it seems, to me anyways, that when the Lego Minifigs lost their regular smile/smirk faces (whether they were masked by a beard or not), that's when Lego began to decline...a bit. The Dragon Masters had their vicious faces and all, but they still had that smile/smirk underneath their rough exteriors. The new knights look a little...less confident.

The 8291 Dirt Bike comes from a long line of Technic bikes, and I think it's the best ever. It looks great, and it's fun to ride around in the house. I hoped to find a figure the right size for it, but none of mine would fit. Unlike a lot of Technic models, it looks good from all angles. Considering the size of the model it has a complicated way of connecting the engine to the wheel. The rear shocks are just the right stiffness... ...and they have a good amount of travel. I thought these shocks were new. I need to get out more... Functions: Shocks: Two front, one stiffer one in the rear. Drivetrain: 2 piston engine linked to the rear wheel via gears and a chainlink. Steering: Yes it does... Stand: Retractable. For the price, size and subject, what else could be added? 10/10 Parts: Considering that it has three shocks and a 40 chainlinks it's a great set for parts. Some hard to use large parts are included, but they are not overused. The usage of the green does limit part usage somewhat though, and I'll be struggling to find a use for those wheels for anything other than a motorbike. 8/10 Price: At $39.99 AUD for 248 parts it isn't the best value set. The US price is $25.00 which is somewhat better. It does have some more complicated parts however. 7/10 Looks: Lego seems to be moving away from the see-though look for Technic sets and this is a good example of it. I'm not a big fan of fairings but I think they work great in this set as a fuel tank. 8/10 Fudge: This set was great for me as I have never had a Technic bike. However for those that want this for just parts or have other bikes it could be a hard sell. The alternate model (a chopper) is a complete rebuild (which I didn't make), and it's great that Lego have been including these most of the time lately. 7/10 Overall: Recommended. 8/10

I think the green motocross bike looks great. I like the use of fairings on this bike. The only thing I really don't like about the Technics bikes in general, is the "clumsy" design of the chaindrive. It sticks way to much out to the side. If they made a really big bike model, it would be more in place with this chain drive. I'm not sure if it wouldn't be possible to design a shaft drive to the rear wheel, ala BMW style. But the green "Kawasaki" look great with the front and rear suspension. I have the Street Bike, 8420, a somewhat larger and more complicated set, and will probably add the motocross bike to my collection soon. It would be great if Lego could make a line of bikes, like they do the Ferrari line. Front

I saw this set at my TRU for only $20.00. Now I might go get it! Thanks sinner for another nice review! Quote hoped to find a figure the right size for it, but none of mine would fit. Well, just sit your booty down and ride it wourself... ... Okay, well, maybe if you have a bionicle lying around or a halo figure.

A very good review, thanks, Sinner. That´s really a pretty cool model, very detailed with useful parts too.... hmm, perhaps that one´s gonna get the first Technic set I´ll buy, beside that 4481 Hailfire Droid.... um, thank you, Sinner....

I have just finished building this set. I was a bit disappointed with the amount of bricks when they were out on my table, but the final model is really nice and totally makes up for that. I like the small details like on the handles and fuel tank and the only real negative thing I can say is that the cog seems a bit oversized in the rear. I don't know if the designer frequents this forum, but I'm sure he will be happy about how much you like it - it took quite some time/prototypes to get to this design: (Sorry about the size of the picture - it isn't mine)

How did I manage to miss this review? I must have overlooked it somehow... Thanks for making this one Sinner, it's always nice to see reviews of Technic sets. I'm not so sure whether I like this set, I am not that much into motorbikes, but Lego did a good job on this one. It looks a lot like an upgraded version of one of the first bikes Lego made, namely the 8838 Shock Cycle. I also believe the back gearwheel is somewhat oversized, it looks better with the smaller one you attached. It is good to see that Lego is back to making the Technic sets the way they were (except for the green, that is )

I wasn't very interested in this set at first. It seemed to be just a nice looking truck with a small motor... but when I found out it had a transmission I changed my mind! Here is the transmission. It allows the single motor to be used for two functions. This system has been around for a while, and Lego seem to be using it more and more. The Transmission Driving Ring alone (the red circle) goes for $5-15 USD on BrickLink, and you also need the Catch and Clutch Gear so I have been buying sets that have them instead. I now have enough parts to make a Supercar gearbox. (I bet a new supercar comes out next year now...) This is the gear that rotates the arm. Note the colour of the 24 tooth gear; it seems to be a new gear trend. A lot of work has been put into this truck looking real. Personally I think they went too far as the truck seems to have been designed for a tilting cab, but it's disabled to prevent breaking the front. Bottom of the transmission. The bottom shaft lifts the arm. Note that there are more dark grey gears. The motor fits in very well also. The bottom of the arm. I was surprised by the usage of a 12 Tooth Bevel to link with the 36 Tooth Double Bevel as I had never seen that done before. As you can see there is no room for any drive train. Standard steering for a recent technic truck. There is a hand-of-god at the cab top that links via two Knob Wheels. It looks good from the back. You can also see the white Clutch that connects the transmission to the motor to avoid burnouts. It goes decently high, and can go a bit higher if you use the crane arm. Compared to last years fire truck. (If I didn't buy the fire truck for half price I would have been annoyed that Lego brought out what is almost a motorised version of the same set.) Functions: Cherry Picker Arm: Motorised rotate and lift that links to a motor via a transmission and anti-burnout clutch. Steering: Rack and pinion controlled via a hand-of-god linked by Knob Wheels Doors: Open and close. Good functionality that works well, but I wish they made the cab lift and I'm a bit sick of the lame fairing door trick. 7/10 Parts: Motor, battery box, transmission, clutch, practical wheels, only two fairings, compact turntable... this is a great parts set. 10/10 Price: At $99.99 AUD for 726 parts it's OK value when you consider what you are getting. The US price is $60.00 which is better, but still not great. I bought mine for $80 AUD which was good however, and I suspect that the price is designed for easy sale...8/10 Looks: I'd buy this for the looks alone! 9/10 Fudge: The functions work well and I llked it more than I thought I would. Oddly mine seemed to be missing a Axle Pin with Friction, but since it includes extra parts for the alternate model I didn't mind using one of my spares. On the subject of the alternate model, it is a dump truck which is made out to be a total re-build, but it isn't. It could have easily been done like Super Street Sensation was, but Lego have probably determined that instructions like that confuse people. 8/10 Overall: Recommended. 8/10

Looks like an interesting set. I didn't realize the motor controlled two functions through a transmission switch. That's always good to see. I'll probably pass it up though until the price falls a bit. The overall design is a bit too studless for my liking (I think the 8275 bulldozer has a much better balance of studded and studless pieces), and the wheels somehow look too small to me. I also have something of a backlog at the moment; I still need to pick up that bulldozer along with the 8421 mobile crane (on ebay).

Set: 7627 - Indiana Jones - Temple of the Crystal Skull Pieces: 929 Price: $AUD149.99 Out of all the Indy 4 sets, this one seems to cop the most flak - which may account for the fact that the other 3 were reviewed weeks ago and this one has sat, unloved and alone, waiting for someone to turn their eye upon it (or, y'know, buy it). Luckily I'm a sucker for spooky old temples, filled with devilish traps and hidden treasures, hissing fountains and overgrown foliage, creepy skeletons and crumbling stonework, so here it is: Indiana Jones 7627, Temple of the Crystal Skull. Part 1: The Figs First off, the figs - 6 humans and 4 skellies (or should that be skullies? ) Indy, Mutt, Irina, and that sneery Russian guy that's in the 2 smaller sets. Nothing new here. Aha! What have we here - two natives. I wonder if hair is a sign of power in this culture, since one guy is completely bald and the other one has the most extraordinarily luxurious black mullet. Somehow I doubt the movie will answer this question. Back view - as you can see, the scalp tattoos are also popular in this tribe. Fashion conscious! (Note in the background the paws of the fearsome black jungle panther, ie my cat, curious as to see what the tribe was up to.) Also, don't ask me why these guys are carrying axes rather than, say, spears. And what everyone's been waiting for, the skullies - three of 'em and a conquistador skellie - very cute. Note the backs of the crystal head have a plume-sized hole - or maybe that's just where they injected the blue brain-plastic. Spooky! I love these skulls, I wasn't sold from the initial pics but they have a very creepy smile and the head shape is just... weird. With the large eyes, it's kind of Homer Simpson-esque. And here we have the token vehicle in the set - a weird little tank thing with treads. Kind of looks like a cross between the amphibious boat and a mini-tank. I'm sure there's a military expert around here who can tell us exactly what it is supposed to be. The treads are nice, but the rest of it is a bit thrown together. You can tell they wanted to keep the dark green colour scheme but the budget only allowed them 5 parts to do so . All in all, a mixed bag with the figs. 4 repeats from the cheaper sets which means we have one new native figure and the crystal skullies. There are heaps of the old-skool skele heads scattered around the sets so those that prefer can replace the skullies with ordinary skellies. Bizarrely, the top of the box which has the line of 1:1 figs pic (you know what I mean) doesn't have names for any of the characters, whereas all the smaller sets do. Part 2: Box, Parts Front of box: Back of box: Two instruction books: Parts. This set has come under criticism for being overpriced - myself included - but the official piece count is 900 plus, which is pretty good considering it also contains the baseplate. 6 big bags and 2 of those 12x12 bricks in dark tan. (Note: set does not contain live Black Jungle Panther™) The DSS, helpfully comes pre-scrunched thanks to TLC. Even in a $AUD150 set they can't get that right... sigh. The dark tan baseplate. Say what you like, I'm in love. I know some people don't like these, but they were such a staple of Castle/ Pirates for so many years that I don't consider them a juniorised piece at all. This one, recycled from the 05 Police HQ and 06 Hospital, is much better in design than the King Leo's Castle one as the different heights and asymmetry make it look much more like a natural piece of ground. Perfect for MOCs. And it's dark tan - how could anyone not love such a huge slab of dark tan? Note this love doesn't extend to applying the stonework stickers which are, frankly, crap. Random instructions page: Part 3: Temple of Doom - or just a doomed temple? The complete set, front view. Isometricish view: Back view: Top view: First impressions? It's very dark tan, isn't it? And green. And bright green. And dark green. And dark red. And normal tan. And dark bley. And pearl gold! In fact, it's a bit of a mish-mash of colours. I'm of two minds about this. I kind of prefer the palette to be a bit subtler, but I can see that a playset designed for kids isn't going to sell bucketloads all tastefully done in shades of tan with lashings of dark-green foliage. There's a huge amount of dark red in this set, which is always a welcome colour, but I'm not convinced it quite works with the 2 shades of tan on offer here. On the plus side, there's also a huge amount of dark tan in ordinary 2x2 bricks, tiles, plates and 1x1 and 1x2x3 slopes, which is great for anyone wanting to stock up. Let's take a closer look. I'll do this roughly in order of the build itself: a) The big scary face. This is a simple, fun build and very effective at projecting menace at the temple entrance. It actually detaches very easily from the temple (as pictured on the box art) to allow easier access to the inside. The eyes are flick-fire missiles, with Scary Face's hair conveniently providing ammo refills should you run out. All in all, from me. (b) The Back Spin the skelly head and stone steps appear - we haven't seen this feature in a while. Nice to get these pieces in dark bley. A conquistador hides under the stairs - this is a bit useless as the stairs can't fully extend while he's there . Moving right... a trapdoor - what could possibly be behind it??!!??!!? Answer: not much, really. A little red stair. I really like these 2 stickers though - very intricate. The staircase leads to what I like to think of as the Crystal Skull Transmogrification Chamber. Now, I know nothing about the movie except that it's supposed to be have a kind of 50s B-movie plot rumoured to feature (look away, spoiler-haters)..... aliens. These weird, creepy gold chairs look made from the bones of aliens if you ask me, with their strange vertebrae and silver claws. It wouldn't surprise me if bringing these aliens back to life was part of the plot of the movie... hence the crystal skull? I guess we'll find out May 22. In any case, transforming aliens clearly like a disco whirl as when you pull the handle, the whole of this assembly spins giddily around. A very clever and simple trick - it's basically just a wheel under the platform but the effect is great. Also under here is a bottomless pit (stickered)... I would very much expect a villian to be thrown down it at some point. "So, do you come here often?" "I don't know who designed this club. These chairs are REALLY uncomfortable." NB. I am really, really over those pearl gold 1x2 roof corner slopes which started popping up in the 2006 Castle range, infected Exo-Force and have now spread here. Can we please have these in a different colour? Or a different pearl gold piece? Pretty please? ( c) Left tower (looking from the front) A small tower with a trans clear gem. (d) Right tower Waterfall with booby trap. I like the sticker, it's very cartoony, which fits with the set somehow. When you turn the wheel, flick fire missiles spray out and hit whoever is on the stairs. Both towers have a trap where if you move the skull, another one pops out from the dragon mouth. (e) Central turret thing This thing is kind of annoying and doesn't really sit or work well. It's kind of like a laser beam sending messages to space, I guess. As the central dome rises, the two plates peel away. I find it is a little bit tight to work smoothly and the two plates doesn't really sit well together at the top. Maybe I just need to rebuild it. I'm sure this will also be explained in the movie. (f) Final trap - the stair that isn't there The final trap is at the front - as Indy goes down the staircase, you can push the red heads and all the 1x8 bley bricks come tumbling down. Simple and works well. (g) Alternate view Here's how it looks as pictured on the box with the head removed. As you can see, this allows better access to the centre of the temple. As you can see, sadly there is nothing actually interesting there except a staircase to the turret and 2 dark tan slopes which are just stuck there and look a little out of place. I mean, come on, everything else has a splash of dark red and gold! Your Destination: Nowhere! Part 4: In Conclusion So after all those endless pics, what about the set itself? CONS:As a playset, 7627 doesn't quite make sense. Admittedly, the traps that are there are well-designed and unobtrusive. On the other hand, there's a great big whopping entrance at the front - but I wasn't sure if the figs are supposed to sneak in through the backdoor and go up the spiral staircase and past the waterfall (as shown in the box art) or if they were meant to end up in the golden skull room. The middle area doesn't really connect with anything, nor does the giant space turret. It may be that some of these questions are answered in the film, but whereas with 7624, 7625 and 7626 I could at least picture a story myself (eg with River Chase is fairly obvious what's happening - a chase down a river with a croc and a communist staking them out)!, the Temple set is a little all over the place. The design feels a little off to me - not really bad but not really great either. PROS: On the plus side, the natives and crystal skulls themselves are great. At 900+ pieces, this is also a great parts pack for dark tan, dark red, plant pieces, gold oddments etc. I especially love the baseplate in that shade. I like the overall shape of the temple - a big staircase with secret nooks and crannies. The build is reasonably interesting and there are some clever tricks with the traps. But upon reflection I shouldn't have to sell this set - it should be able to sell itself! As I said before, I'm a huge fan of dark, mysterious old temples so for that I have to give it some love. It reminds me of the big old Adventurers sets and the whiff of nostalgia is itself a powerful intoxicant. However, for the price Lego is selling it in Australia/ Europe/ Canada I couldn't recommend it as a must-buy for full price when the smaller sets in this series are themselves so good.

Thanks for the great review, svelte_corps. I've been wanting to see this set in detail since it debuted at the conventions. I have to say that, on the one hand, I agree that the minifigures, the crystal skulls, and the colors are great (I even like the waterfall), but, on the other, I kind of think that the set itself is a disappointment. It looks like they tried to accommodate design and playability needs, but really didn't come through on either. So, as you pointed out, the mid section doesn't really fit in with the other parts, and the trap sequence doesn't really flow, either. But, perhaps your right, and all will be answered in the film. I was surprised at just how empty the temple looked in the photo taken from above. They really should have gone the extra mile and made the temple look more like a temple, and not worry so much about the action features. Eh, but so it goes. But, I, too, am a sucker for tombs and temples, so I won't be able to pass it up. Archaeology on!

Thanks svelte_corps for the great review, if it's out in Aussie then it should hopefully be reaching NZ soon. I can't wait! This looks like a great set, for me at least. I too am a great fan of spooky old temples, they are such fun. I love the look of the base plate, but the stickers don't look all that great. I wish they printed it like they always used too. I have to get this set. And the other ones too. Thanks again, you have brightened this sad day.

I was going to review this on Monday but my camera ran out of batteries! Anyways, great review! As I have the set built, it's a really fantastic set. The waterfall is a reall cool sticker, and the flick fire missiles are quite interesting. Another point of interest: There are seven of the new flick fire missiles overall, if anyone cares.

svelte_corps, on May 1 2008, 02:44 AM, said: (e) Central turret thing This thing is kind of annoying and doesn't really sit or work well. It's kind of like a laser beam sending messages to space, I guess. As the central dome rises, the two plates peel away. I find it is a little bit tight to work smoothly and the two plates doesn't really sit well together at the top. Maybe I just need to rebuild it. I'm sure this will also be explained in the movie. Great review! Now I'm really truly convinced that I'm gonna buy this set. My faith was a little wobbly, but its benn restored Anyway, I just wanted to point out that the temple's entrance might actually be the turret thing. If you watch the teaser, there are some very similair stone pillars surrounded by sand (there are 4 not 2 though ) and when they close up it looks like all our characters are sucked into the sand and magically appear underground going through some stone plates(which act like steps to go down) that dissapear. So, in theory those steps beneath the turret are actualy the entrance, and I'm asumming from this picture That the steps with 1x8 bricks with the dragon heads at the end lead us of somewhere else. All in all this temple looks like a mixed up version of the real temple, which is fine by me (SIDENOTE: I'm not sure but based on minifig inclusion, either Lego was cheap or Colonel Dovchenko is dead by the time Irina and her goons reach the temple, I'll wait till I see the movie. ) Edited by Belloq, 02 May 2008 - 02:14 AM.

I know that alex54 had already reviewed this set beforehand, but I wanted to give my 2 cents (it is really more like $1.50) on this set I bought from toys 'r' us on friday (guess what, the price had not been increased by a dollar like all other sets, ). This is my first review of a set ever, don't be too mean. 1) Box It captures the potential (I don't know how the scene plays out... for now ) action of the scene nicely and is very pleasing, good job TLC . On the back it shows some of the play features of the set and a net little comic. Indiana Jones seems to be surprisingly calm considering that he is about to be captured under a net and attacked by a snake (the thing he fears most). 1a) comic not much to say on this... 1b) screw up At the top of the box, both "Russian Guards" have the same grining face, in the set one has the generic bad guy face from 7620. 2) Contents The box opens up to reveal a quartet of bags, an un-crumpled manual (YAY!), and a sticker sheet (BOO!) 2a) DSS Yoda said every for of rambling imaginable about this accursed item, I have nothing to say. Meh... 3) Minifigs The only thing that has not really been discussed about the figs that you get in this set is that Marion has a slightly new torso. 4) Parts of interest When I opened up the baggies, these were the components that grabbed my attention. A DARK GREEN alligator, a net piece that I Know has appeared in sets before hand ( I needed it for a MOC I am working on), some raft part that is probably very old, a ladder with two pairs of hindges, and a DARK brown version of this part. 4) Build (amphibious vehicle) This I one of the more enjoyable builds of the new line. But that is just my opinion. You start of with some thing very simple... By the end of the next page, it starts to bulk up More detail... Beginning to look like a car... 4a) Build (rear attachment) Bulk it up and add Taillights... Done... Slap it on to the main vehicle... 4b) Build (Front attachment) I am running out of things to say... Bulk it up... Add some detail... Add a gun and headlights... And attach to the rest to get the completed vehicle... Add stickers... I honestly think that the amphibious vehicle looks much better with the stickers than without... 5) Build (boat) This build goes by rather quickly and adds to the playability of the final set. Base... Apply clamps... Add more to engine... Build more detail and a gun base... Finished boat... Plus stickers... I love how Lego slips in the product number into their stickers. 6) Build (tree fort) This is the weakest part of the whole set. But I find my self liking it more and more for some odd and inexplicable reason. That tan 6x6 will most likely see use in a pirate themed vinigete soon (not mine ). Install net-launcher... You spend the next two pages building this... And putting it on... A tree branch that is an ugly mix of brown, dark brown, and frown... (our commie friend seems to like coffee a lot) Second branch... 3rd... (a wee bit to much on the coffee there, don't you think?) Final step... The only redeeming value of this section is how well the net launcher works, fantastically. The rest is just utter fail. 7) Spare parts Very little in terms of what is left over... Finished set... All in all, this set is a fine build and an excellent parts pack for dark green components. I recommend this set strongly, despite its few weaknesses.

Nice review! Although you need to use the Macro setting(a.k.a. the Flower setting) for better pics. Are you using a digital camera? You really need Macro... The idea is, turn it on and hold down on the 'take picture' button halfway until the pic focuses. Then press it down all the way to take the pic. I'm glad this one also comes with the new Uzi; I wanted an extra...

Very good for a first review! I bought this set and Jungle Duel at Target the other day (I was going to wait and buy them when I go to Downtown Disney this summer, but how could I pass up saving four bucks that I can spend on store-exclusives? ) and I have to say I absolutely love them. The amphibious vehicle (don't they call it a Duck in the movie?) is definitely my favorite LEGO vehicle I've ever built. Everything about it is wonderful- the size, the colour scheme, and it's accurate to the one in the movie. And Irina Spalko's hair is to die for. On a side note, I don't get why they made Marion's arms white in the set. The shirt underneath her vest in the movie is obviously blue. I switched the arms out for light blue ones and it looks a lot better, and it makes Marion's eyes look great. -Ryan

While i truely fell in love one more time with the older lego city sets, i thought, why not make a review of one of the, in my opinion greatest city sets of all time. Let's not talk too much, here we go! Set Nr.: 6395 Name: Victory Lap Racetrack Number of minifigs: 13 (!!) Number of pieces: unknown Release Year: 1988 Starting with the beautiful old Legoland box: Front: Back, with some cool alternative models: Inside: We continue with the great minifigs, which are not less than 13! I don't think there is any city set with more figures, is there? Civilians: Race Crew & Assistant Personnel: Drivers: All: Here's a overview of the whole set: The "Rescue Rig" (don't exactly know how to call it) with trailer: The score board & Traffic Lights, which would be one of the details i love the most about this set: The next sweet detail, the Camera + Cameraman! Of course we have a doc, if there is some kind of accident: The pit stop boxes, i love the small tool-holder with the axle and wheel behind it: The control room high above the racetrack: Ready to go?!! That was it all in all,all i can say is, if you see this set anywhere on ebay ore somewhere else, get it!

Thanks for this review! You have reviewed my most favourite town set of all times, I am so happy to own this one. I actually is a story to go along with it: In the summer of 1998 I went on holiday with my parents to the country of Luxembourg, in the city of Wiltz we encountered a small toystore which still had this set for sale, (9 years after the release!). I did not had the sufficient amount of money to buy the set and had to leave it at the store, I was practically in tears... Four years later we passed through Luxembourg and I remembered the city and the store. We made a detour and stopped by the same store. Every other old set was sold, the only one remaining was this one! I bought it immediately and treasured it ever since. I use the baseplates a lot in my cities, they serve well as roads with parking spaces next to them. This was the first set I owned which had the huge 6x24 plates in them, I remember my surprise when seeing plates of such enourmous lenght... I recently made an entire racetrack together with this set and to promote myself I will place a link HERE

metalandi Thanks for this wonderful lovely review. I enjoyed myself very much when I am looking through at the lovely pictures. I must admit, this is what I called a "real classic" race prix I miss those cute sweet little race cars which is able to contain a mini-fig. Furthermore, this set offers 4 race cars and 13 mini-figures In addition, if town collectors remember, the car number tiles are printed instead of using stickers. This is the other set I owned, which holds the similarity above. 6381: Motor Speedway Overall, great review! simonwillems, on May 9 2008, 02:20 AM, said: I recently made an entire racetrack together with this set and to promote myself I will place a link HERE I saw your entire racetrack.

Hello all, I don't believe there has been a review of this set yet, so I wanted to take this opportunity. Up for review today is 8160 Cruncher Block and Racer X as part of Batbrick and iamded reviews: Here is the box, I have to say I love the art on it. It's very colourful and makes the truck look a lot less crap than it does on the box. Plus, you have to love the "Missile launching action" bit right, am I right? Why are you all staring at me? And here is the back. Pretty generic, but shows some nice details and so forth. Oh dear! In turning around the box have I killed myself AND iamded!? Okey dokey, up first is the best part of the entire set: the minifigs! Racer X is wonderful, though coming with a boring Bruce Wayne face. But it is Cruncher Block, his lady Driver Taejo that really shine. Look at those awesome suits! The cool faces! Taejo has a ripped shirt! Now up is the first building part of the set, with me and iamded looking rather slick in X's car. While I'm not a big fan of yellow, it is very nice, and slopes in an underused colour is better than no slopes at all: Front view, the new windshields are fantastic: While a very cool car, it is rather silly of TLC to give us the exact same one we got in the smaller set. I didn't get the smaller set with this car, so I'm still happy, but it is a bad marketing move: Sorry iamded, I know it's your birthday, but......VROOM! Now for the second part of the build and my favourite, the front of the truck: Annoyingly enough, this part opens up to shoot a pointless rubber projectile: To do this, you open the roof (a nice detail btw) and pull back the mechanism, here: Thus blowing the front part open and launching it.....well, not far really The wheels and covers are pretty cool, and the front is nicely designed, the red looks good and the rear vision mirrors are a great touch. And now for the most disappointing part - step three, the trailer: (Note - Clicky joint piece not part of set, just used to hold it up!) That's right, almost the entire thing is open, even the "filled in" side has holes! I'd certainly be cared to be back there, one bumpy hill and back you go! I didn't put the lame computer stickers on, and the control area is pretty lame in general. Not to mention Taejo (who is depicted on the boxart as standing at the desk, would most likely just be sucked out the back at those speeds! There are some pluses too though, like the ridiculously awesome minifig paintings I'll be using for Wayne Manor. Also note the "control" on Cruncher's desk that when turned, turns the gun at the bottom. It's an alright feature: Here is an example, I've shot iamded on his birthday. What? It's a love ray! Haven't you seen the Care Bears? And though I'm not a massive fan of stickers, this is just too cool. The little aquarium is very simple but very clever, using a printed piece between two clear windows to create the illusion of a tank: It looks much better in real life, trust me, and here is a side view to better explain: Now, to connect the two is a good thing, I like the way a simple technic piece assumes the job. Oh, and behold my hand! The completed truck, which, while a mixed bag, still doesn't look too bad (I guess): Now the completed set, which, despite its unbelievable large flaws, still looks cool. (Warning, the kickass iamded and Batbrick figures do not come with this set): More pics here: http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=3147324 All in all: Minifigs: 5/5 - Racer X is beautiful, Cruncher Block and the Driver too, and Taejo has a ripped shirt, damn! Design: 2/5 - Pretty poor considering the best part is available in a cheaper set, and only the front part of the truck looks cool, but still not truly awful. Build: 3/5 - Despite having a bad trailer, it was a fun build and sometimes you need something that doesn't take ages to make. Price: 2/5 - Overpriced easily, but Rogue Shadow is worse! Fun: 3/5 - The mere concept of such an open truck kept me playing with this baby for hours! Total: 15/25, not as bad as it would seem. Overall I'm really glad I bought it as the minifigs are fantastic and the paintings and fish tank are cool. It's fun, stupid and downright ridiculous, but while not a great set by any means, certainly isn't as bad in the brick as it looks in photos. Until next time, Batbrick Away!

Awesome review Batbrick! I don't see any appeal at all really in this set, but that's okay, as I want to stick to Castle anyway. The car is the best part IMO, which you can get in a different set with another cool car and for a cheaper price. But the main downfall to this set is the fact that the truck's trailer is half blown up and the survivors are magically staying inside and not being sucked right out of there, as you have mentioned. I would have thought TLC would at least included some sort of cover that you could take on and off easily (kind of like the modular buildings). Having said all that though, the front of the truck does look incredibly cool, and those minifigs are sweet. Too bad they all have flesh tone printed on them. So, while this may not be my set of choice, I can see the appeal... well, really I can't, but it's just my opinion! I'm sure there are plenty others who would love to scoop this set up. ~Peace

WARNING! This reply may contain several minor movie spoilers. If you haven't yet seen the movie and want it to be a complete surprise, do not read. Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: But it is Cruncher Block, his lady Driver Taejo that really shine. Look at those awesome suits! The cool faces! Taejo has a ripped shirt! I was originally skepitcal about the driver figure—I like the head, but I was trying to figure out why they put in a female minifig with no hairpiece. After having seen the movie, I now understand why; Cruncher's driver is a fairly manly looking woman, and most of the LEGO hairpeices would make the minifig look too girly for the character. :) Now that I know why Taejo's shirt is ripped up I don't mind the bits of fleshie color that are printed on it, but I do wish they would make some of the new torsos a little more head-colour agnostic...there's no real reason why Cruncher and his driver couldn't have had ties that came all the way up to their necks instead of having those little wedges of flesh showing through loose collars. Yeah, they are low-level mafioso type scum, but they aren't complete slobs. Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: Front view, the new windshields are fantastic: They are indeed very nice, it's the main reason I started looking at the Speed Racer sets in the first place. Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: While a very cool car, it is rather silly of TLC to give us the exact same one we got in the smaller set. I didn't get the smaller set with this car, so I'm still happy, but it is a bad marketing move: I think the error they made was in the smaller set though. In the movie, the only time we see Cruncher's semi is when he's being chased by Racer X. Racer X and Taejo do end up on the same team for a cross country rally race (along with Speed of course), so I guess that's where they were going by putting those two together in the smaller set, but it would have been much more interesting for them to have made up a set with Taejo and one of the cars from the very goofy, comic book-gimmicky teams they are racing against. Especially since one of the teams (that is chasing Taejo specifically) is a bunch of Army-wannabee loonies—I'm sure more people would have loved some sort of dark/sand green racer with one of the IJ Soviets at the wheel than another Racer X. To summarize: Two Racer X's is bad, but it is the smaller set that should have been changed (imho). Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: Annoyingly enough, this part opens up to shoot a pointless rubber projectile: Thus blowing the front part open and launching it.....well, not far really As much as I normally don't like the stupid techic launcher thing, and would rather not see it in a set ever again (although one of these days I will make a giant multi-launcer rig out of them just for fun), at least there is a reason for it to be in this set, as Cruncher's semi has a missile launcher in the front end of it in the movie. I think you're supposed to lift the panel that hides the missile before launching it, similar to the way that panels slide out of the way on the semi cab to allow for firing in the movie. Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: And now for the most disappointing part - step three, the trailer: That's right, almost the entire thing is open, even the "filled in" side has holes! I'd certainly be cared to be back there, one bumpy hill and back you go I'm gonna chock this up to the standard LEGO philosophy of "playset" rather than "model" design for a lot of things. The semi rig and Raver X's car are the models, the trailer is the playset. Seeing as how the trailer is Cruncher's mobile office (rather finely appointed with lots of paintings and his pirahna "babies" in their tank behind his desk), and the intent seems more or less to have a playest bit in order for kids to re-enact the scene from the movie, I'm not going to give them too much grief over this. They tried to capture the basic bits of the movie set (which we see mostly from the inside during the movie) and translate it into a playset type environment. That being said, I do wish the back walls were more solid, as I see no reason for there to be gaps in the back wall when the front wall (or the "fourth wall" as the case may be here) is already conspicously absent. Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: There are some pluses too though, like the ridiculously awesome minifig paintings I'll be using for Wayne Manor. Also note the "control" on Cruncher's desk that when turned, turns the gun at the bottom. It's an alright feature: Could have been a little better, but it's such a minor bit of this scene in the movie that I can see why they didn't spend too much time and effort on it. It would have been nice to have more paintings though, had the back wall been more complete (and I like your idea of how to use them :) ). Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: And though I'm not a massive fan of stickers, this is just too cool. The little aquarium is very simple but very clever, using a printed piece between two clear windows to create the illusion of a tank: Definately a feature which is not showcased nearly well enough on the box art. Since it is one of the major features of this set in the movie, it's nice to see it translate rather well into brick. Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: Design: 2/5 - Pretty poor considering the best part is available in a cheaper set, and only the front part of the truck looks cool, but still not truly awful. That may be a bit harsh (but not much) given what I've said further up this post, but it probably only deserves a 3 at best, so I'm not realy going to quibble the point. :) I still think that Racer X should be exclusive to this set and a different car should be in the smaller set with Taejo, which would have improved the cachet for this set overall. Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: Price: 2/5 - Overpriced easily, but Rogue Shadow is worse! True...this should have ideally been about a $30 set (especially given the general awesomeness of the IJ Race for the Stolen Treasure set), unless they made the trailer a bit more detailed (better back wall, perhaps some drop down gun ports like in the movie) or at put least one (or more) of Cruncher's goons in the set, then maybe I could agree more with the msrp. On that note: if I remember correctly from my visit to my local TRU yesterday in search of the new IJ sets (since local Targets seem determined not to get them in stock yet), they had this set on sale for around $35 along with an offer for a coupon good for $7.50 towards the purchase of a ticket to the movie with any Speed Racer toy purchase over $25. I may be wrong on the sale price, but I know the ticket offer was there. So, if you haven't seen the movie yet, and are interested in this set, TRU may be the place to go right now to get both at a slightly cheaper price. Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: Fun: 4/5 - The mere concept of such an open truck kept me playing with this baby for hours! So you did enjoy the playest aspect of the trailer, even though you didn't care for the design...looks like they didn't do too badly then on what they wanted out of that bit. :) Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: Overall I'm really glad I bought it as the minifigs are fantastic and the paintings and fish tank are cool. It's fun, stupid and downright ridiculous, but while not a great set by any means, certainly isn't as bad in the brick as it looks in photos. I was actually thinking about going and getting this set now that I've seen the movie and I understand what the heck is going on here more. Your review has definately added an additional impetus to that notion. My pocketbook (does not) thank you!

Batbrick thanks for the sweet review. You give me great insights into this set. Hehe, I agreed that Racer X is nice, but I believe we can get it in the other set for a much lower price. For me, the trailer which does not have a cover is bugging me alot. That's why, I holding my reservations against this set. At most, I will consider the other 2 smaller sets for collection purpose. Nevertheless, Batbrick great job

Nice review, brickbitz. I actually think this kit is really very nice for the size. True, you only get three figures, but it seems that's a norm in most batman sets. Besides, everything else is great. The tumbler looks like an amazing build - they really nailed this tank of a ride. And the Ice cream truck... Plus, this set does seem to have some neat pieces in it (trans green popsicles and lime hubcaps, anyone?). I think this far beats the rest of the batman lineup this year, which seems quite disapointing overall. Edited by Grevious, 16 May 2008 - 08:12 PM.

Thanks a lot for the review brickbitz. I really love this set, sure the figs are annoyingly not new, but the ice cream truck is fantastic and the Tumbler is a marvel of black slopes. I see now that it is far too huge though, I reckon I will either keep it that way as a "mega tumbler", mod it to become another Battank, keep it as a model Tumbler, or pull it apart and use the bits to make a Tumbler like Wetwire's awesome one. Love those popsicles though, and those wheels are very nice, so overall as a loyal Batfan I love the set, even though it could've been better. Batbrick Away!

General Grievous Reviewed by Dunamis Set 10186 1,085 Pieces $89.95 from LEGO Shop @ Home Build time 3.5 hours It is the start of summer here in California and along with the weekly deluge of new action films we start to see some of the next wave of Star Wars LEGO sets. The latest offering from our favorite building toy company is none other than the infamous General Grievous! No doubt you all know the story of Grievous; two parts Technic and one part human and his hatred of the Jedi. Follow along as we get a close-up view of the mighty General. No doubt the observant will wonder why I purchased this set from Shop @ Home instead of my trusty LEGO store in Glendale. Well, it’s really as simple as two things: I’ve been traveling a lot and didn’t have time to drive to the store to get it AND gas is now $4/gallon and I would likely spend more in gas than the $9 shipping cost to get it to me. So there you have it. The Box: A gigantic box (much larger than expected) held the mighty General. We’re back to the perforated tabs on the side and two stickers on the front that let the box lift open: Inside, we have 17 bags, two manuals and three stickers on a relatively small sticker sheet. The Manuals: The manuals are not terribly thick in fact the second manual is noticeably thinner than the first. They come in at 75 and 31pages. Interesting to note on the back we see the next (and more interesting) wave of sets later this summer. Nothing new to report on the manuals as they provide the LEGO standard of high quality and features we expect. - Piece callouts - Models divided into sections - Large images - Page numbers Since there were links posted to the .pdf files of the instructions online, I’m sure you can all get an idea of the manual and the parts inventory. However, for those of you without access to the Internet here are photos of the parts inventory pages: Random manual image: Features page: The Pieces: The short answer is you get lots and lots of little pieces in white, gray and black plus some big pieces in white, gray and black. Mixed in the set is a fair amount of oddball pieces like minifig tools, Jedi hood and trans yellow dome. Fear not, despite the eclectic collection of parts, it all comes together in the end (not unlike a typical day at work for me…) It is probably worth noting again that there is a heavy amount of Technic parts and pieces here. The Build: The build starts off with a rather in-depth build of the stand in which General Grievous stands on. Once you think you are done, you keep adding on to this (rather solid) base. I bet there are 250 pieces just in the base alone! It is quite nice when you get done with it though and really adds to the display. I’m glad LEGO didn’t skimp on the base as it completes the model. Once you get through all that, the rest of the build is a real thumb-bruiser. Anyone who has built a decent size Technic set knows the feeling of your thumbs being sore when you are done. You get the same effect here. It is actually a fun build and I really liked seeing how the designers used all the various pieces to recreate a fairly accurate model of Grievous. The model is built from the ground up as seen in a few of the progress shots: Here is what is left over: The Design: The design is quite good and is very accurate. Some might be disappointed that since this is a Technic set we don’t have more articulation in the shoulders and have the ability to separate two arms into four as seen in the movie. However, it would seem the real intent is for display and not functionality. Here is a shot of the torso and the detail involved: Here are Grievous’ organs: Careful observers will note that my model is lacking two “arrow” stickers from the two white chest pieces. I failed to see these on the sticker sheet and only grabbed the large Grievous sticker. So, note that there are actually THREE stickers and not ONE. Chest protector and respirator: Head and arms: I was a little disappointed that we got two yellow blades and no green blades on the lightsabers. Note how all the lightsabers have different hilts which is a nice touch: Here are some shots of the completed model with a few other sets shown for scale. He is actually pretty tall: You have the option to remove the top two arms and put in shoulder plates if you so desire: Detail on the back: Overall Thoughts: I’ve been saying for a few years that we should have a Technic Grievous set and we finally got one. Designed more as a model and not a fully functional swooshable figure, Grievous is a tad flimsy. You won’t want him to veer too far off his massive and sturdy base. It would have been nice to have is cape with him (like the Technic Vader set). I do like the size of the model and it is impressive to look at. LEGO Star Wars System fans will likely want to think twice before purchasing but Technic and UCS fans should be satisfied. Final Rating: 75% Build 8/10 (Very Good – Fun, relatively quick build. Technic fans will be more pleased than others.) Design 8/10 (Very Good – Some nice SNOT and Technic techniques. A bit flimsy but the base is kind of cool.) Parts 7/10 (A mixed bag of stuff. Probably can’t get too many diverse builds from this except for other robot type models.) Price 7/10 (Just OK – A bit stiff at $90 USD for a nice display model with limited functionality.) As always, let’s hear your thoughts and feedback.

Hey Dunamis, think you can get a straight-on shot of the face? The red pieces inside the eye sockets are topped with trans-greenish-yellow studs which make his face look eerily alive and very close to his screen appearance. It's a nice little detail that seems to not show through on pictures I've seen of the set. The legs are a little wobbly. I'm scared that he'll be leaning too far forward in about 5 years

Though the alien craft does also look neat, and it's cool how it can fold down into aa walker. Or rather, a sentry turret, seeing as it can't really move while in that mode. Still, it's nice. My favourite part is the mini mining robot though. So cute! ~Peace

Thanks for that interesting review, brickbitz. The alien fighter looks pretty nice, nothing special but streamlined and fast nevertheless. That transforming feature´s a nice addition for sure, and these new flicker missile with its launch apparatus.... hmm, I hope I won´t spend quite some time in search of that little 'rocket' piece.... However, there´s still something I miss with these alien crafts.... I don´t know.... I like some more organic looking design, and they even come in some nice and different shapes, but still.... perhaps a real space fighter just needs a solid cockpit, cool windscreens and controls to satisfy my odd likings. That 'exo suit' looks really good and I wonder why it´s a little underrepresented on the box art. The jet pack/space scooter´s a really good idea, and the only thing I hate´re those darned studless technic beams.... it could look so much better with a studded version of these parts. But of course that´s only due to my personal preferences.

Hi y'all! Guess what happened today? When walked into my Toys 'R' Us in Fullerton, CA, just to buy a simple Tiny Turbo racer, what do I see? All the Agents sets sitting on the shelf, ready for the taking! I didn't have too much money with me, so I just got 2 of 8631 Mission 1: Jetpack Pursuit! It's a really cool little set, so I thought I'd review this puppy for you! I shall proceed in the order of the instructions. So, let's get started! The Minifigs Let's begin with the minifigs, Saw Fist and Agent Chase! They are really cool, some of the coolest minifigs I have seen in a while! I took off Saw Fist's wig & chainsaw so you can see his head and cybernetic arm better! Here is a back view of Saw Fist, and - SURPRISE! Agent Chase has a double sided head! One side with his cool "mission face" with sunglasses and headset, and one with his casual Bruce Wayne type face (note, though, that it is not really the Bruce Wayne face). His wig, btw, is Mutt's hairpiece in black! Very neat! Poor Saw Fist seems to be forced to always drag his chainsaw around for it is way too long to just hang down from his shoulder like a normal arm. The Snowmobile Next up, we have the snowmobile, a sleek little vehicle with only minor design flaws! The container with the jewel is attached to the vehicle by a single stud, so it doesn't fall off, but is easy to pick up! In the pic below you can see the only two tiny design flaws: Thanks to the exhaust pipes, the laser cannon (or whatever it's supposed to be) can't be lowered any further than this. Also, the corners of that slope-ish piece that the handle bar rests on are sticking out a little at the sides. Other than that, it's pretty well done! The Jetpack Finally, there is the Jetpack! IMO, a name like Autogyro-pack or something would make more sense, but whatever. Although a little bulky, the Jetpack is very well designed! The rotor can be tilted back, and at the lower back of the Jetpack, there is hook with which you can grab the container with the jewel from the snowmobile. What I like best about the Jetpack is that although it is attached to the minifig in kinda the same way as that of the Riddler, this one doesn't rotate around. So, the Agent is being held in place steadily! "See ya later, chainsaw-cyborg-dude!" Stickers This set comes with a surprisingly large sticker sheet. The reason is that half of it are extra stickers! There are two large Agents logos and one Inferno logo - perfect for Agents MOCs! There are also a star and a small, round sticker portraying the number of the mission. The star seems to be part of some kind of game where you collect the stars from all sets on an Agents ID that you get from the Mission 5 set. I don't know, though, if you get any gain from this except for becoming a full-status Lego Agent! Below, you can find the list of parts from this set! Click here for a better quality pic! That's pretty much it! I hope you liked this review and will run straight to your next toy store to get one or more of this set! This was my very first set review! So any questions, comments, or requests? Any more pics you want me to take? Would you like me to exchange the chainsaw with something else, or do you want me to try the Agent's new hairpiece out on another fig? If so, just tell me! See ya!

Thanks for the excellent review Oky! Judging by this set, the line is going to be promising. I really like the figs and I'm glad to see that robot arm is actually a new arm mold. Awesome!! Can a minifig hand fit in the end or just the chainsaw attachment? Could it fit an Exo-Force robot claw? There's a lot of detail in the torsos and I like that the Agent's suit is like a moto-cross uniform. I love that the snowmobile has a working tread. Copmike, Ras and I tried to build a snowmobile with working treads, but we ended up using chainsaw blades in the end. Great work Oky!

That's a great review for your first one. I think the jet pack if far to bulky it could do with some minimising but that’s life. I assume that you can’t fit a standard hand in the chainsaw arms are the hole would be to large but would you be so good as to confirm this for me? Overall I quite like the jet ski and the ability to lower the arms to much doesn’t both me. How much was it just so I can get an idea of the price? Finally thanks for posting this review so quickly.

This is MUCH MUCH MUCH more promising than the 2008 Batman set for $10.00. The vehicle looks like someone took time to design it, but the Batman one looks like . Lego dear Lego, where is the quality for Batman??!?! I really like the new cyborg arm, and the propellers on that thing : ), it is a really promising line although I would get rid of all those bionicle pieces.

Thanks for the great review Oky Wan The two vehicles look quite nice for a small set and the minifigs look great! The two sided head is nice, although it would've been nice if it was a new head rather than the standard frowning face. The cyborg looks good, nice and cartoony, I like the printing on his back. The belt on the hips should be useful, not to mention the robotic hand. I assume that anything that fits into a 1x1x1 cylinder can fit in it? I hope so Thanks again Oky. Any chance you can get any more sets?

Huhm .. i like the idea of the agent-ID .. but offcourse all they want with that is that you buy all six sets .. but it can be a good idea for children, they wouldn't think of "hey they get all money only because i have a little card with stars" or something. Well, not to rant, i think it's good. Also, can you make that name yourself? maybe set 5 comes with a extra stickersheed with all letters, that would be nice "Agent Rupee" A very nice review Oky Wan Kenobi. =Rupee

Thanks, guys! I really tried to make it a good first review! Now to answer your questions: The robot arm can fit EF robot claws and anything that a minifig can hold in his hand or that would fit into a 1x1x1 cylinder, so normal minifig hands are too small to fit. TLG is using the robot claw idea for the main villain of the Agents line! Do you still want me to try it out and take pics? The price was 10.99 USD at the TRU I bought it at. I bet it'ss be a dollar less on S@H! And I'm sorry, but I probably won't get any more sets any time soon. I have to save my money for all the other good set that are to come. But if I would get another set, it would just be the one with the helicopter and the all-silver car! If anyone gets this set, can he/she PLEASE review it? Thanks! Any other questions I can answer for you guys? Edited by Oky Wan Kenobi, 18 May 2008 - 08:59 AM.

Oky Wan, thanks for this wonderful review! I really have mixed feelings towards Agents set. Haha, but I love the Agent mini-figure. The double-sided face is great and I love the sunglass look. It's nice that they made use of Mutt's hairpiece which is personally my fave hairpiece at the moment The jet-pack is neat. Making use of the additional secure backing onto the mini-fig is really very smart.

I kind of like the set. As said it has a very cartoonish style to it so I'm guessing the kids are going to love it. And as a parent I'll love it if the construction isn't to fragile. ;) I'll probably be getting a few for myself but only as parts pack. copmike, on May 18 2008, 11:29 AM, said: And the excaustpipe is a new peace also I think? Yeah and it's all over this years releases. From what I've seen so far it's found in: racers, Speed Racers, Mars Mission and Exo-Force sets. I just wish that instead of a 2x1 plate with an exhaustpipe in each end they would have made it an 1x1 plate with a single exhaust. That would have been a lot more useful.

I love the way the bad guy has a special attachment on the jewel case JUST to allow the Agent to grab it with his hook. It's like the two of them sat down beforehand and drew up the plans for the vehicle together... CYBORG: "OK, and then I'll make my getaway in the special snowmobile and you can follow me..." AGENT: "...And I'll scoop up the jewel and return it to foil your plan". CYBORG: "Perfect. See you Tuesday?" Dr. S.

Good review! Thanks Oky Wan. Hmm, although I really like the villain (not just the new arm, I think the color is very... villanous, as all Bond-villains with class have minions in uniforms. It's even possible to fill out their numbers with Exo-force grunts of the same color) I'm not that hot for the agent himself, his uniform... nah. It doesn't even look like clothes, just give the man a suit or some nifty leather. I think I'll try to grab some sets from the agents line just for the new parts (to begin with... MOCs may follow, who knows?) when they are available in stores here in Sweden. Haven't seen them yet, though Indiana Jones just got here so there might be some further waiting for me. Now I want to see reviews of the other sets :)

And that monobrow, I mean, villain guy looks very... er... well, the monobrow is unique, thought I noticed the suit looks a bit skin tight in the crotchal area.

Thanks for the review... Ill probably get one copy of this set. Mr. Freeze and his cart look neat. I dont like the huge wing on the back of Batman's buggy so Ill probably mod that out.

Quote But I have to say that these two small vehicles just look plain ugly IMHO, without any inspiration nor orginality Indead. The only reason to get this set is if you couldn't afford the Batcave back in 2006 and want a Mr. Freeze fig for a cheap price. And anyone who did get that kit really have no reason whatsoever to get this. Wait, did I forget something? Oh yeah - thanks for the review, Riddler. Edited by Grevious, 22 May 2008 - 11:54 PM.

I'll get it, I admit the vehicles are extremely poorly designed, I mean REALLY poorly designed, but the Mr.Freeze fig is fantastic, and I would buy two of this set just for him, as his head and gear are very useful for mocing. It also comes with some nice pieces, like the grappling hook, little wheels, exhaust pieces and such. Still, a pretty bad set build wise, but it has atleast inspired me to make my own Batbuggy Thanks for the review theriddler, appreciated. Batbrick Away!

Thanks for the review! For such a high price that we need to fork out, compared to a total pieces of 76. It's is very expensive to pay for such poor design. But then, I will still considered to get them. As what Sinner had said, this is a very good way to get Mr Freeze without getting the Batcave. And it so happened that, I do not have the Batcave too. I believed that is the cheapest set among the four. So, for the mini-figs ONLY, this set is recommended. Other than that, I am sorry.

Like many others, I'll buy this just for Mr F, quickly recycle the parts, and pretend this set never existed. The flame detail is indeed terrible. The Bat is back - and he's flatulent! This third Bat-wave isn't really doing anything for me. I'll get the Penguin set as well for pretty much the same reason - although the sub on that is pretty cool - but skip the others. Maybe Batbrick can make us all nice alt-mocs to improve these sets... Thanks for the review though!

Pretty nice review for a first time ???theriddler???. Next time though, if your camera has it, use the macro function (little flower icon) and perhaps a tripod. That should get rid of any blur and provide you with better pictures. Apart from that, a good little review. Keep up the good work!

Neat little set. I do like the parts a number of hard to find bits all in one pack, depending on how much it costs in USD I'll have to consider it. And while the buggy designs kinda suck, I'm a little happy to see them, its been years since TLC made any small go kart style vehicles. I guess Tiny Turbos have been overshadowing that market?

That's a great set. It'd be even better if it were sold as two separate little cars. They remind me of the dozens of little LEGO cart vehicles I got as a kid. Those were always fun, quick builds that resulted in lots of cool play. I think this set is aimed more at kids and, in that respect, it's a pure winner. It doesn't hurt that you can get Freeze and the newly designed Batman both in this set for a reasonable price.

In actuality, I think that this may be my favorite Batman set of all time. I know, I know - it's a small set with crappy tiny vehicles; so it probably sucks for the fan who likes to display sets; but look at the MOCing side and you see this set has a ton of potential: -New Batman fig. Well, mainly the torso; but it looks nice, sleek, and armored! A definite plus whether you're a MOCist or batfan. -Mr. Freeze. Because nobody bought the Batcave when they should have...and by nobody I mean me. Plus, I love that head! -Cheapest way to amass the lightning piece. The other sets that have it are lolhueg (Well, not really, but I don't have $50 to toss around on a little skeleton tower...), and it's a great piece. -Two little blue gems. I may be alone on this, but those are my favorite parts (the gems), and that's my favorite color for them! <3 <3 <3 -Several other useful parts, including a +O piece in black, some light/medium blue bits from Mr. Freeze's kart, the oddly placed grappling hook, and some cheap wheels. Now, I don't know about you guys, but this is as close to a Batman Battlepack as we're going to get, lol - I'm buying at least three, maybe more once I get my summer job ^.^ (Oh, and the fact that the US price is only $10 helps a little, but this year you guys can't complain - you got practically every set first, ESPECIALLY the new castle! T.T) ~Trexxen

I got this yesterday and built it this morning. Apart from the figs, it is very crappy. Mr Freeze's buggy is OK but the bat buggy is easily the worst vehicle I've seen for years. Colours are all over the place, the grappling hook feels cheaply made, the inclusion of those odd pearl silver parts which have been in the Exo-Force sets seem especially random here, the terrible Bionicle flame piece... It's the first Lego vehicle I've built where I've immediately had the urge to disassemble it and pretend I never bought it! Really, I only got it for Mr Freeze so I shouldn't complain. But still. It's a real step backwards. The comparable Catwoman dragster set was heaps better. The Penguin sub is sweet though Thanks for the review anyway!

Coming in at around $50 US, Turbo Car Chase is one of the bigger of the new Agents sets. A big box with a helicopter, car, and gate in it. Seems like a winner, but how good is it really, and is it worth the cash? Let's start with the Minifigs. This set comes with a standard Inferno Henchman, Spy Clops, and Agent Chase. The Henchman is you basic LEGO criminal type with a gun and a jumpsuit, nothing real groundbreaking here. Spy Clops, on the other hand, is very cool for, technically, half of a Minifig. His head has a neat electronic goggle print and the rest of him is a torso mounted onto a set of six legs made from Exo-Force robot arms. The whole thing is really well done and neat as hell. Agent Chase (Turbo Car Chase! ) seems to have a standard agent body and a double-printed face with one side a sunglasses and headset print. The other face is a determined Agent look. The set also includes a laptop with Doctor Inferno wallpaper. The laptop is a new piece and works like the LEGO books that are in a lot of Harry Potter sets. Molding on the keyboard is really well done and the thing can be held by a Minifig along either corner, but not in the middle and not while closed. The gate in the set is nothing revolutionary by itself, and I sort of get the feeling that it was included to drive up the piece count and the set price point. That being said, there are some things to like here. For instance, the gate has four wheels of barbed wire attached to it. The barbed wire is new and makes me want to start building some World War I trench MOCs. The rest of the gate is fairly big and it has a handy ramp attached so that vehicles can roll through it easily. The main feature of the gate is a sound brick. It's much better then LEGO sound and light units of the past, when the gate is opened it depresses a button and an alert klaxon blares that sounds every bit like a prison-beak in progress. The triggering action works surprisingly well and it's pretty much for this feature alone that I'm not going to immediately break the gate back down and add it to my parts bin. The designers did make an effort to create more then just a fence though. A nice control panel connected to a big spotlight crowns the piece, and a pair of cameras watch the opening. It's really hard to mess up a LEGO helicopter, and this set is no exception. The Inferno Chopper is a nicely proportioned and well built machine. It looks properly menacing and has the uniform orange and black of other Inferno property. It's armed with a set of four Technic pegs cleverly used as guns on outriding mounts, as well as a pair of the newer-style flick-fire missiles. I personally don't care for flick-firing missiles, but these look decent enough and seem to stay put so I really can't complain about them. Along the fuselage are a pair of intake pieces that I've never seen before and I'm guessing are new. They're pretty well designed and will come in handy for MOCing down the road. The action feature of the aircraft is the wench system. This is very different then other LEGO wenches in that you build the entire mechanism and housing. You can then use it to raise Spy Clops up and down from the bottom of the chopper using the rotor. Now, this also keeps you from sitting there and just giving the rotor repeated spins to simulate flight. I'm not too thrilled with that, but there are a hundred other LEGO helicopters out there with fully rotating rotors, so I guess I can let it by just this once. As you'd suspect, the bottom of the cockpit is completely open, which makes this a vehicle pretty much solely for Spy Clops (Sorry Henchman). But there is plenty of room beneath the body to attach a plate with some seats on it to accommodate another pilot without drastically altering the design, or even removing existing pieces. The Turbo Car is a slick little honey of a LEGO car, and the silver pieces that make up the body work contribute a lot to that fact. The front license plate appears to be an Exo-Fore code brick. But it also hides the activation lever for the passenger ejector seat. The seat works about as well as the Spruce Goose, which is to say not well at all, but here it's the thought that counts. The interior of the car is really well done. There's even a radar screen for keeping track of pesky helicopters. But the Bond-like features don't end there. A lever in the compartment raises pair of guns in the hood and a knob on the rear deploys a quad rocket system with more flick-fire missiles. This is a car that won't be stopped easily! The rear has two cones sticking out. I'd like to think they're smoke nozzles or oil-slick sprayers. All-in-all, this is a really good set. The car is pure LEGO vehicle love and looks fantastic. The silver pieces are very nice and it's a shame LEGO doesn't use metallic colors in System sets more often. There are, however, a LOT of sticker for this set and I know how much that bugs a lot of people. I personally like how much detail the stickers add to these sets and don't mind them so much. The set also comes with an Agents ID card for Chase which you can put little star stickers on from other sets as you get them. It's printed on a real nice piece of sturdy plastiboard and would be cooler if you could put your own picture and name on it instead of pretending to be Chase. Sold by themselves, the car and chopper would be must-haves. All tossed together with the gate sort of makes the set a little less then the sum of it's parts. And with 498 parts (most of them small) that's not so hot. It's only slightly over-priced in my opinion, but if you do shell out the money you won't regret it. I'm very comfortable recommending this set to anyone. Close to perfect, but the price and some minor flaws bring it back just a little. I'd say 4.33, but out of 5 is close enough!

I picked up this set earlier in the week and was quite pleased with it (in fact I have missions 1-5 and am happy with all of them - this series is much better than the old Alpha Team ever was). I look forward to reading your thoughts on it. I will say 2 things about it now though. 1)My set came with defective instructions. In 2 places pages are missing and duplicates of other pages repeated. For instance, the car instructions are missing steps 16-21. Fortunately, I was able to make out what pieces went where in the missing steps by studying the illustration in step 22. I hope you have better luck with your instructions. 2)This set contains the best LEGO sound brick ever (it's just begging to be incorporated into my Arkham Asylum).

WOW! Thanks, Deino, for this great review! I can't wait to get this myself, but right now I gotta save for the CW sets! The car is with no doubt one of the most mind blowing things TLG has come up with and we can only hope that there will be more models made out of almost only metalic colors! The spider cyborg, while not as innovative as some of the other cyborgs, is a very nice fig, and his head will be very usefull for Splinter Cell MOCs! And those intake pieces are only relatively new btw, they are in almost all of the current $10 Racers sets. Any chance of you taking a pic of a line-up of all the silver parts in this set?

Thanks for the review Deino! I love going back through the old "Agents" thread just to see how wrong we were about these awesome sets! I actually really like the gate, those portcullis pieces people may know i always find nice uses for, and I really, really, really want that awesome sound brick. The figs are a bit disappointing in numbers, but agent Chase is very cool, generic henchman are great, and Spy Clops is one of my favourite minifigs ever! The helicopter is wonderful too, I love that it is customised for Spy clops to winch him down. The colours as usual for these sets are fantastic, the dark blue, orange and chrome silver! The car is the best though, I love all the functions. How does the ejector seat work though? Batbrick away!

Wow, thanks for the great review Deino This set is really a must have for me. The sound brick seems great, the helicopter looks very nice and the car is superb! All of the James Bond features are really cool, though I'm very interested in how the ejector seat works (or doesn't work..). The car itself is very sleek and full of beautiful silver, and the inclusion of the new rims and windshield mean that I won't have to buy many Speed Racer sets. As for the minifigs, they all look great, especially SpyClops. Though it looks rather easy for him to fall off of his spider legs. Can you confirm this?

ES.JPG 47.94K 110 downloads The ejector seat A long Technic axle runs the length of the front of the car. It comes in to the seat area here and nests into the gray joint which is attached to the small gray Technic beam. The beam is attached to the ejector seat (bottom white 3x2 plate) with a Technic pin. The seat, in turn, is attached to the side of the car with a Technic pin. The result is, when the axle is pushed forward, the gray joint and beam tilt the seat and "eject" a Minifig. After about 20 shots the Minifig only went outside of the car 3 times...the rest of the time he just bounced around the inside of the car. So they get an A for effort, but an F for execution

Thanks Deinonychus for another great review. I must say I do look forward to people uploading reviews of new sets, it really helps me decide if I want it or not. If it's a good set (IMO) then it adds to the excitement of picking up one myself! This, I must say, is one of those sets! The only concern for me, like alot of others, is the price. I will just have to wait and see and continue to look at these photo's Deinonychus has provided for us!! So much for thinking the Agent line was going to be weak! I wonder if the ExoForce style code brick number plate is a hint from TLC as to what will replace ExoForce at the end of this year? JB

The car is just beautiful, and with a good use for the most expensive part of the gate, this is on my wish list for sure, just have to see how much cash is left over after buying the new death star in a month or two. Agents has to be the biggest surprise from Lego for ages, without any pics it sounded so-so, but they've done a brilliant job with it, love those metallic coloured pieces!

Hello all Eurobricks members, I will present to you a very short review on the recent Castle Battlepacks. This time, I will be reviewing Skeleton Battlepack, and I hope everyone of you do enjoy viewing it. This was a request that put up by hollisbrick in the Castle thread. Initally, I thought it was a very simple set to do a review. However, for the love of Castle, I decided to whip this up for every Castle fan out there. This is an image of how the Skeleton Battlepacks look like. I have bought 12 last packs of these in total so far but none of the Crown battlepacks yet. There were snapped much faster, that I imagined. Do pardon me for the poor lightning. Today is a bad weather, it's hard to get natural light. The Skeleton Gang For a single battlepack like this, with an attractive reasonable price. You obtained a series of 5 skeleton mini-figs with tons and tons of useful castle accessories. To me, it's a very very great buy, and it's a MUST to stock up for my army building! Some add-ons! However, I was not very satisfied with my Skeleton armies standards. Therefore, I decided to make some slight modifications with some additional castle accessories that is stocked in my Castle warehouse. After the makeover, Ok, this is what I called a real skeleton army. This is mainly my opnion and it have to be aligned with my standards. I felt this improved battlepack gives a punch to the exisitng battlepack. The two soliders on the right, is able to align with the rest of my Castle Chess sets armies. While the one on the left, it gives me a great archer back up with the quiver and helmet attached to him. The ones, on the center especially the armored guard which equipped with the black nose cone helmet is my fave. It is able to illustrate the "Elite" among the rest of the guards with its armor and helmet which was featured in my Castle Deep Forest Expansion MOC.. Promotion On! In addition, the one which was hastly done with a modify mace, it looks rather simple. In time to come, I will change it and gives a better equipment and look. These are the remains. I can use the axe for my dwarf in my dwarf mine defender. In that set, there is no weapon for my dwarf and I have to get it from other sets. The rest of the accessories, makes a very good stock up for future upgrading! Overall: 9/10 This is not a playset. It is mainly bought for its abilty to mass recurit any armies, and is a main love for all Castle Army builders such as me! This set mainly have no major faults, and I love it so much. Although, I have done some slight modifciations, but this set is a must for me to buy more and more! Meanwhile, I will need to wait for the next shipment! Hope everyone have enjoying viewing this simple review of mine! Edited by WhiteFang, 25 May 2008 - 12:52 PM.

I like the look of them after your make-over, a real skeleton army there! Did you say you've bought 12! Tht's lots of Skelies. Are you planning a big MOC or something?

dragonator, on May 25 2008, 08:21 PM, said: Thanks for the review WhiteFang. I love these sets, and I wish they were available in NZ. So far, it seems they may never come here... But I can sit and hope. I like the look of them after your make-over, a real skeleton army there! Did you say you've bought 12! Tht's lots of Skelies. Are you planning a big MOC or something? No problem! I had bought it last month. I thought it was so simple to do a review for this. Was looking through the thread, then I realised there is a request for it. It was an unexpected shipment that send to Singapore. It came in very limited quantity. Most of the battlepacks were snapped within a day or two when it arrived. Well, I am thinking of building something big in the future. It's just a plan that I have not decided yet. For me, I always love to see the beauty of a big army with different battalions, forming a kingdom. That's why, I always buy many many sets that have figures that attracts me. And for this battlepack, it served a very good purpose for it!

WhiteFang, on May 25 2008, 06:14 AM, said: For a single battlepack like this, with an attractive reasonable price. You obtained a series of 5 skeleton mini-figs with tons and tons of useful castle accessories. To me, it's a very very great buy, and it's a MUST to stock up for my army building! I wish these battlepacks had a reasonable price click here to see the Canadian price of these battlepacks, 18 dollars thats 6 dollars more than the Starwars battlepack yet you get the same amount of Lego (or Less then a Starwars battlepack). How the Megablok does Lego price its items . I'm gonna have to skip this set, and a few others that I wanted because of this bloody outrageous. Back on topic thanks for the detailed review, Whitefang I also like your little changes to the set they really make this set look better.

Yes, the price for the battlepacks is a little steep. However for the amount of mini-figs and castle accessories, the price and quantity justifiy my bulk purchase. This is one way to acquired soldiers without spending much money on other sets. In this way, you will save much more. I understand the concern of Star Wars Battlepacks from your country. But in my country, Star Wars battlepacks are priced much much higher than the Castle Battlepacks. Asuka, on May 26 2008, 01:38 AM, said: Thanks, WhiteFang! Castle Battle Packs.... simply wonderful!

Too expensive to be coming with only a few figures. 20$ earns you the same amount of figs, plus a catapult, barricade, two horses and a jousting divider. Are you refering to these following sets? Both these sets adds up to $18.00 (CAD) And the skeleton pack have the same price of $18.00 (CAD) *prices quoted from S@H I understand that 7009 and 7090 offers more pieces, horses and same amount of mini-figs compared to a typical battlepack. IMO, I feel that all 3 sets are all army building sets. 7009 offer small catapult, 3 mini-figs, a skeleton white horse. 7090 offer a joust divider, weapon rack (good accessories), 2 mini-figs, a horse with barding and a skeleton black horse. These sets have different purpose. For me, buying multiples of 7009 is to build its catapult, white skeleton calvaries. While 7090 is to build on Crown calvaries and Black skeleton calvaries. However, Battlepacks have a different agenda. It offered some castle accessories that is not available commonly. For a Castle army builder like myself, castle accessories are always in demand. The black robe, silver armor, silver short-axe are not very common castle accessories. It can be used as a good stock up too. I am not saying this battlepack is an one way solution to solve everything. That's why, different sets are released to target on different purposes.

WhiteFang, although I realize that the battle packs are great specifically for building armies, and castle accessories (which is why its such a shame that I won't be able to buy these things ), while sdpirate's sets are more for a catapult, Calvary whatever. The fact to the matter is with the battle pack you get: 5 minifigs with lots of accessories. While with the sets that sdpirate showed us you get: 5 minifigs with an okay amount of accessories 3 horses (including two skeleton ones) A ballista A weapons rack, and a jousting barricade. You cannot say that the battle pack contains the same amount of stuff that the other two sets have and therefore should be priced the same. It just seems that Lego is ripping off Canadian army builders, to me if the battle pack contained a small catapult, or wall so that it contained about the same amount of stuff that the other sets had it would be fair. It seems stupid that you will only get minifigs from one set, while you can get about the same amount of minifigs plus a bunch of other stuff from two other equally priced sets. That’s why to me these battle packs are a rip off, because of what they contain, IMHO the Battle Packs seem to be only worth about 10 dollars.

MacK, I can understand your concern when pricing is concerned. Pricing is always a big issue for us to determine whether to buy or not to buy a certain set in a particular country. Pricing varies differently across different countries such as US, Europe, Canada, Australia and etc. This is something very hard for us to decide on. We can't be sure why TLC placed their pricing strategies this way. Well, I think we should appericate what TLC is trying to do for us, by not using price as the only factor to judge whether to buy this set or not. At least, I am sure there are many of us trying to request for battlepacks to muster armies for their MOCs, Armies Collection and etc. Different people have different judgements towards different sets and different themes. I respect your opnion. IMO, let's don't let price be the only determined factor to decide whether to purchase a particular set or not. Instead, consider an array of factors that is offered. However, I do know that consumers like me and you are always affected by price. iamded, on May 26 2008, 01:40 PM, said: Thanks for the review Whitefang!

That mace was a much looking weapon. It looks much firm than the orignal look. The design was inspired from Dwarf Mine and Dwarf Mine Defender. I would not want to have so many troll flags hanging around. The nose cone helmet, was to give the soliders a whole new look. To me, it retains the classic look, yet it belongs to present theme, suitable for my Skeleton Elite Guards.

There are so many great stuffs waiting for you such as Dwarf Mine, Tower Raid and etc. However, I can understand that the problem of space is always the key issue.

For me, I will use these battlepack for army building purpose. I always feel that every kingdom needs a considerable amount of soldiers to defend their kingdom. Therefore, most of the time, the amount of soldiers will dictate how strong that kingdom is in my collection. In the future, I hope to build large castle scenes, combined all playsets, armies everything together and developed a kingdom scene. Of course, that is just a dream for now. I am still currently not able to afford much space and time to do such big scale project at the moment. Meanwhile, for this great castle theme, I am storing them at the moment and take it out when the time is ripe. One day soon, I hope I can post an image or two of my armies.

Hi gang! As you all know, Indiana Jones IV has just debuted, and TLG has released a set depicting the Incan temple (7627) from the film's climax. But Lego beat Harrison Ford, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and company to the punch by nine whole years with Johnny Thunder's adventures in the Amazon Ancient Ruins. The Vitals: Year of release: 1999 Parts Count: 453 MSRP: $80.00 The set included eight figures: (from left) Two skeletons, Dr. Lightning, Gail Storm, Gabarros, Achu, Johnny Thunder, and Señor Palomar. On the far right is my new sigfig, el Conde Voltio Villar. Construction begins with Dr. Lightning and his jeep. It's a sturdy Adventurers-style vehicle, with fatter tires at the rear for better traction. Next is Gabarros and his unusual boat. The hull is from Belleville/Paradisa sets, where it is usually pink or white. TLG ought to have put it in the Pirate theme, as it is a nice, intermediate size. In this set, it is a small steamship. The temple is built on modular 8x8 green bricks which fit into square holes in the baseplate. This is the "treasure room." This square has a nasty double-spear trap. Careful... This is the top section of the temple, crowned by Achu the (mummified?) Incan. More modular sections (these are from the front of the temple site, across the river from the main building). El Conde: "You are too beautiful a woman to be wandering alone in the jungle, Miss Storm. Please, allow me to accompany you." Gail Storm: "I'm with Johnny, and I have a cutlass." El Conde: "I'll be on my way." Here's the finished temple, with all parts in place. Now for the traps... "Hmm, a giant ruby to bring home to the king." "¡Uf!" "That was embarassing. Miss Storm saw me fall..." "And now I've fallen again!" "I had better rest here before something worse happens." "¡Chispas!" "That's it, I'm leaving this place!" "Why me? Why?" The Verdict: This is a fine set, a set whose bare parts/price ratio does not accurately reflect the intricacy of its design nor the rarity of its parts. I had to buy replacements for some of them, and let me tell you, they are PRICEY! That green baseplate? $14. The little dark gray saucepan near the fire? Not available on Bricklink at any price. The brown boat hull? VHTF. With this set, parts quality trumps parts quantity. And the minifigures are wonderful! There's not a dud in the bunch with the possible exception of the very common Dr. Lightning, and even he is not bad. When you factor in the coherence of the color scheme and the brilliant traps, it is obvious that 5986 is a classic. 10/10 Edited by WhiteFang, 27 November 2008 - 05:33 AM.

Thanks for this great review, voltio! I never knew of this set 'till now, and it really looks great! I never paid much attention to those Aztec/Incan style sets, which I now regret. I love the bright colours used here, and all the great traps, there's so many of them, which is exactly what we can expect from an old Incan temple like this one. I'm surprised there's no catapult. Anyway, the minifigs included are also great, and am I right in guessing those bricks are printed? That would be fantastic, as they look amazing. That boat hull is new to me too, although I guess the fact that it's mainly in Belville sets explains that pretty well. Thanks again for the sweet review, do you have any other Jungle Adventurers sets you plan to review? ~Peace

A real classic, thanks for that nice and funny review, voltio! A well designed set, very playable with a lot of nifty traps, a very good use of that raised baseplate and really nice crafts. The MF characters´re excellent too! And although the color scheme´s great and original, especially with all these neat printed pieces, it´s perhaps the only part of that set that looks a little out of date today.... Nevertheless, the set´s plain charming and shows clearly that TLC don´t need licenses to do some distinct Adventurer sets.

Thanks for reviewing this rare set! Since it came out in 1999 I have only seen this set in a toystore one single time, one single copy as well... It was in the summer of 1999 in Belgium (Arlon) in a store called 'Maxi Toys' (Belgiums TRu, I think). They had the three biggest Junglesets for sale there: these Ancient Ruins, The set with the beautiful black boat and the zeppelin. Being into Adventurers at that time I had never seen the entire Jungle theme (not even in a leaflet or catalog) and surprised as I was I bought all three sets. That was one happy Dutch boy in Belgium! Surprisingly the two smallest sets made it in very small quantities to my local stores in Holland (except for the pontoon plane and small raft which was my very first Shop at Home order). The spider's secret I bought off BL, which makes me the proud owner of the entire Jungle Serie. Back to the set: This was the first time in a long history of collecting Lego that I had a deformed piece: an 2x8 red plate was twisted, I twisted it back and it still serves it's purpose... I loved the whole steam-idea in this Jungle serie: the two boats both (including the one in this set) had nice steamengines and a very cool mechanic (yours has the wrong hat/hair btw) to come along with them. The skeleton falling down on the end of a chain was the most intriguing part of this set for me, it worked really well and when you were done scaring minifigures you could winch it up again ready for the next go. The only thing I did not really like about this set was the difference in wheelsize on the car, front small, back large and the way the palmtree consisted out of just three parts... All in all a great set that is becoming more rare and expensive as we speak/post. Get it! Edited by simonwillems, 26 May 2008 - 07:59 PM.

VHTF= Very Hard to Find. To answer some earlier replies... No, there are no stickers in this set. While some Adventurers sets of the era had stickers (the 5956 Zeppelin had tons), all of the interesting mesoamerican designs from this set are printed. Also, simonwillems was correct; my mechanic is missing his hat, which should be a black kepi. They're extremely expensive on BL, though (proving once again that this set has some awesome parts), so I ordered a replacement from Lego. It's in the mail and should come soon.

Too few pieces for such a high price- but amazing figs too, and a nice baseplate! Despite a 4+ palm tree, you get more palm tree leaves for MOC's. Plus, I think a monkey? And that sweet Achu figure.

I just rebuilt this entire set today, and the nostalgia was totally worth taking bits and pieces from a few of my own MOCs. Only now did I realize how rare some of those pieces are, and I'm rather thankful that I have all of the printed pieces, and Achu. The only pieces I am missing is a transparent orange headlight (3 out of 4), black minifigure hammer, light gray chain(replaced it with a dark gray chain), and ONE WHOLE minifigure, which is the mechanic guy. I still have both the instructions and the box, and both are in appalling conditions. Kudos to the pre-2000s lego sets like this one! Love 'em

I had one of these! It was awesome, it went well with the zeppelin. I can't remember if the box was one of those fold up the lid ones though. Can't tell from the picture. Anyone want to jog my memory, I always thought the sets with the flap lids were the best, I kept those! Edited by GiantDinosaur, 26 September 2011 - 08:38 PM.

Welcome to Cardinal Brick's Review of 7736 It's a small set but as I bought it the other day I felt that it probably did merit a short review. The box is ofcourse far larger than necessary! There's plenty of air inside. The contence is one bag and the instruction booklet, you could proably build it inside the bag if the desire took you. We have one new coastguard with the slightly stubly head found in the castle range and a trans-clear visor. The build was challanging and arduious The final product is quite nice at one ?3.00 it's a good set only 50p more than an impulse set and with enough extra parts to justify the increase in the price. A good set for a little gift or so on, the buggy moves well. There's not that much to say really for I can't really think of additional models to build with the parts but then what do you expect for the price. Edited by Cardinal Brick, 26 May 2008 - 06:47 PM.

So i just piced up a new digital camera and i thought what better way to try it than doing a review of my newest set. The new 7738 Coast Guard Helicopter! itsmy first review, so go easy on me! lets start off with the small stuff. First the mini figs. You get 4 figs total. Two helicopter pilots, a diver and a civilan to rescue. The torso's are nothing new on the pilot and diver. Same ones as in the last coast guard line. But i like the colors alot better in this coast guard line than the previous generation. The yellow and blue really work well together and the coloring on the badge looks great! The civilian looks to be just a dock worker with an overall torso and a beenie. The diver has nice vented helmet and a pair of flippers that suits his duty perfect! Next we have an absolute work of lego art. The rescue raft! The orange flaps can be moved back for easy entry to the raft, as well as the white "support" beams with the caution tape. I put support in perenthaces cause they really don't support anything. Just there to fill in the gaps. At the top of the raft is a red locator beacon, ccommunications antenna, and a cargo loop for lifting the raft. lets move on to the interior of the raft. Not much here. But you can see the techinc beam that attaches to the top loop,and to the floor of the raft. So far this has proven to be very sturdy and has supported the full weight of the raft quite well. You can also see the white box that holds the equipment of the raft. Here you can see the life saver tube. Here's a shot with our dock worker peaking out the side. The raft says max ocupants 4, but with the storage box, that might be a tight fit. Now lets move on to the Helicopter! in my opinion this is one of the best helicopters TLC has come out with to date. I really felt they captured the look and proportions of a real Coast Guard helicopter. it uses a lower hull and tail section of the new airliner, and cargo airplane. It really seems to work well with this application. The engines have good detail using new "cheese graders" as vents, as well as the new engine stacks that come in the new speed racer sets. The rotors also appear to be new as well. lets move on to the cockpit. We have two seats for our pilots with a sticker sheet for intruments on a flat 4 wide plate. There's also an antena being used as a flight stick. Another shot with our pilots at the helm. Now lets moveon to the high lihgt of this heavy lifting machine. The med bay, and lifting winch. http://www.brickshel...icopter_020.jpg here you can see the winch arm at rest, along with the medical strechter. The bad part is that the med. strechter doesn't include the ussually included fold away wheels. here's a shot with the winch arm extened ready for rescue! In the second shot you can see the drum that the wire coils up in. It coils up via a recently new power functions "pull" back motor. To operate, just pull out the winch cable, hook on your load, and presse this orange button on the side... The bad part of the new power functions winch is that although its very smooth in its operation, its not very strong. It will only lift the raft a couple inches before it runs out of torque. It also has a tendency to want to pull the crane arm backin while its lifting. It doesn't matter if its a light load, or heavy load. The bay doors open on both sides for easy postioning of the figures and accses to the strechter. Here we have our diver looking over his rescue-e. Nice and roomy if you don't mind a crane arm being in your way!! At $39.99 and a peice count of 445, i felt this set was a great good considering what your getting. The raft construction is very creative and is probbly the highlight of the set by itself. The helicopter is probbly one of the best, if not the best helicopter TLC has ever came out with if you can get over its size. in a scale of one to five.... Price- Peice count- Playability- Design- overall- .5 I would have given it a full 5 out of five, but since the winch can't pull the raft all the way, it didn't fell it right. Even with this minor flaw, i still highly recomend this set!

Great review, 5150. Although, you might want to resize your pictures before posting them so they don't take forever to load. Quote Wow. I was skeptical of this Coast Guard line. I was actually the complete opposite. Ever since I saw the first pictures, I fell in love with the whole line. The helicopter looks to be one of the two best in the line, right up with the 4WD and Jetski. Great job TLC, and I do hope you have something equally as great planned for next year.

Klaus-Dieter There is no real way to lift up the stretcher. Due to the crane arm being in the way there really isn't any room for any kind oflifting straps. The set does include a 1x2 plate with a hinge for the diver to stand on so at least he can hold on to someone, the crane lifts them up and then he can put them in the strechter. Thats my guess at least. As far as the motor, i don't believe it uses bateries since you pull out the motor, and all the button does is recoil the winch line back in. I have to say it does a very good job of that, and is very smooth. (as long as you don't have anything to heavy) One detail i forgot to meation is the shark. Its nothing new, just the basic shark lego has had around for nealy 2 decades, but it was a detail nothing less.

All stickers i'm afraid. Though i'mnot a fan of stickers myself. Some sets (like Ferrari for example) take longer to put on than building the actual set. This one is not as sticker heavy as it seams though, and the ones that areon there really give the set that extra touch. Printed would have been preffered of course, but in this case i didn't mind it.

That's a very nice set. I'm having my doubts about getting it though still. The overall shape and size of the helicopter remind me of the real-life CH-53 military cargo helicopter. A very nice review. You've got the photography down very well I feel. Perhaps a bit of nitpicking but at the end where you assign a rating, if you do a rating with faces (which is fine by me) you may want to seperate the faces by a line. Otherwise it may become too crowded to the eye.

And can they be held by a minifig by the handle? If so, these could be very useful for brick-build weapons & tools! Also, I'm looking forward to some orange ETA 2 Jedi Interceptor MOCs now!

I'm rather fond of helicopters and have built many different types. This doesn't really remind me of any particular model, other than perhaps an EH. 101 Merlin and even that resemblance is very superficial. Just for the record: this is a Sikorsky Sea King and this is a Sikorsky MH-53 (a derivation of the CH-53). The only resemblance I see with the former is the colour scheme and with the latter the fact that it's got a fat rear-end, sponsons and six blades. It doesn't matter though, because I really like it. The colour scheme is great, the shape is nice, it's got quite a bit of detail and I just have to get my hands on the cockpit window and those new rotor blades. When I first saw the large aircraft pieces a few years ago I figured they were very much single-use parts, but the tail end doesn't look too bad. Pretty clever. I like the raft too. It really does look like the real deal. That the helicopter can't lift it really isn't an issue, because in real life they wouldn't lift the raft either. They'd use the rescue hoist to lift the occupants of the raft into the helicopter one by one (or perhaps in pairs). Imagine a storm with a helicopter hovering over tall waves with a big fat raft strung from a cable underneath it. The raft would catch a lot of wind and flop around quite a bit, causing it to loose all its occupants and also yanking the helicopter around, possibly causing the pilot to loose control and crash. Bad idea! Cheers, Ralph Edited by Ralph_S, 30 May 2008 - 11:09 PM.

I too thought the Joker's van was the pleasant surprise of this set. The Tumbler looks good yes, until you see it in person... it's grossly oversized. They should have made it closer to a regular car size (like the movie), because this one is a monster.

I bought this off ebay, while not having been collecting space as a child, it was mainly Wild West and City... I have decided, upon reading KDog's M:Tron Bar Brawl Mania strip in his Space Comic, to buy as many M:Tron sets and figures I could find.. except I got distracted and bought some different sets as well... To start off with, here's a picture of the box: Here's a general shot showing the entire set: A front view: The buggy: Another shot of the buggy without the minifig: The flyer: The flyer without the Minifig: M:Tron crate with some equipment and hoses, I don't know the use of the hoses though : The cockpit open: The cockpit closed with the crew: The Magnetic crane: Another shot of the Crane: Rear View with Hatch open: One of the side slots that can carry either the Buggy or the Flyer: Top view of this excellent Vehicle: Excellent for getting Spyrius or Blacktron out of your way : Final shot: Excellent set, one of the biggest space ground vehicles and one of the best sets made by LEGO. Undoubtably better than it's newer counterpart the MT-101 Armored Drilling unit.... A great addition to any collection and has a lot of cool neat features that make it have a lot of playability. Simply excellent! Five out of Five!

Great Review of a great set. I always figured the hoses were welding torches (attached to jetpacks, yeah!) as the whole thing had the vibe of a mobile repair center. Much like many of my favorite sets, this one has a base of simple bricks and plates and then from that solid foundation the rest is built out to be decorative or have the action features. This gives sets a very solid feel as demonstrated in this set, the first Snowspeeder, and Galaxy Explorer. The MM Armored Drilling Unit has a more technic base giving it a less solid appearance and though I like the set, that jet that luanches from the back is horrible, partially because of the useless orange containment things. The Mega Core has a nifty crane instead of a big useless jet. -Tohst

It is just so dense when you build it, full of nice surprises, no technique required, and a wonderful stearing mechanism that I rank as more important than the suspension of the mars version. This thing was meant to crush anyway, who needs suspension? I also like the way you never felt that the M-trons deserved a base after building this, it was that good... The colour scheme was perfect... It's space and I like it... enough said Great review BTW God Bless, Nathan Naturally you're entitled to your inferior opinion...

I love the design of the front canopy of this set, but I always felt that they could have done more with the rest of the model. This set is good candidate for customization though. There is quite a bit on unused space inside, especially in the middle section. I want to try putting a Technic-style engine into mine at some point, along with the necessary gearing. I got my MCM brand new off ebay some years ago for a pretty good price, but the box was very worn out and the big trans-neon panel, which floats freely inside the box, was a bit damaged. As for the hose/jetpack things, I always assumed that they were either welding torches or flamethrowers. Take your pick.

You're right, I should have clarified -- it's the old loose magnets that apparently are being discontinued, not all magnets altogether. As you noted, the new train couplings still have magnets, but they appear to be permanently attached to a fairly large housing, which I guess will prevent kids from eating them. But the old M:Tron round magnet pieces are presumably discontinued.

It looks like you're right about the old magnets. I got a few off PAB two months ago but they no longer have them. I guess I should grab some while they're still widely available on Bricklink, as they can be useful in a number of situations. On a side note, one interesting thing about this set is that it seemingly had two US/Canada names, Mega Core Magnetizer and Multi Core Magnetizer. Brickset, Lugnet and all the other sites I've seen call it Mega, but I have some North American catalogs from that time period that call it Multi and the box also says Multi on it. I actually didn't know the Mega name at all until many years after the M:Tron line.

Tohst, on May 28 2008, 04:55 PM, said: The MM Armored Drilling Unit has a more technic base giving it a less solid appearance (...) Yeah.... it´s pretty sad, some of these new sets just look very cool at the outside, but appear to be hollow and blank at the inside, especially with the annoying use of studless technic beams. To MOD these sets often means to change the whole inner frame, leaving us with a bunch of IMHO not really very useful parts. It´s not a very honorable marketing strategy to produce set designs that´re aimed to look impressive and cool on the box art, but´re pretty useless in their inner structures. Of course I don´t want to offend some Technic lovers, and although I always was more the System kind of guy, why can´t they just use some technic beams with studs at least? I grew up with 'just imagine', with pictures of alternative models on the box, and I don´t think it´s that easy, especially for younger kids, to MOD some of these terrific blown-up sets like it once was with sets like this one here....

I bet TLG was tired of letters and calls saying "Timmy can't make this model shown on the box. Can you send instructions and the extra parts..." Of course it´s a money issue.... my question was more rhetorical. But I still don´t like how they sacrifice inherent set design on the altar of cost saving efforts. To be even more correct, I don´t understand why they try to make extraordinary cool looking sets with a pretty weak 'inner life'. Yeah, they want to sell sets with something that looks exciting on the box art, but.... LEGO was (and fortunately, is, with many recent sets too) always more than just an impressive spaceship or S.F. tank vehicle.... it´s the sum of the set itself and its parts and what you can do with it that makes out the full fun of it. The best thing you can do with a new set, beside some UCS sets perhaps, is to MOD the set according to your own likings. This is where 'just imagine' begins, and how kids start to learn how to MOC, at least it was like that to me.... Individualizing official sets, and looking on some cool alternative models gave me my first ideas and helped my imagination and skills to grow, back in these days when I was a wee child. Books, movies and t.v. series as a source of inspiration just came a little later.... I can see many people complaining about how to make the alternative models, yes, but just stop using them on the box art´s a very poor solution and a dangerous one too, at least in long terms. Of course I know that you know all these things too, Sinner. I just think it´s a shame, and a risk too, because TLC´s perhaps sacrificing more than they might know by yet.... Building with bricks is the main attraction of LEGO, not just some cool crafts to play around with.... others can do this too and maybe better than TLC. If the kids of today ever forget about the fascination of being imaginative, TLC´ll only lose in the end.

This super set contains many of the city sets you can get for your mini city hospital. The smallest set is the 7902 car with a doctor. I thought it looked a bit too slow. Here is a car you can build with the same bricks. The instruction manual for the ambulance does contain a picture of an alternate model, but it is actually quite hard to build something significantly different. This sets lacks some SNOT-bricks, so I had to be a little more creative and came up with this ambulance. It is more a hearse than an ambulance. The helicopter has a lot of slopes, so I built a speed boat for those special emergencies. Unlike the first two sets, I used far from all the bricks in this. This set does really have some great parts. The brickshelf gallery with some more pictures. Is anyone up to the challenge and build some alternate models of the last set in the super pack - The hospital?

Harley & Mistah J. I want to preface my review by admitting that I’m an unrepentant Harley Quinn fanboy. I’ve been enamored with the character since she first appeared in Batman: The Animated Series back in the 90’s, and I’ve since followed her misadventures through her introduction into the regular Batman series during No Man’s Land, into her own series, and even on the short-lived and not-so-good Birds of Prey TV show. So please excuse any pro-Harley bias. So, down to business. The 267 piece set retails for $30 US ($35 at Toys R Us) and builds up very fast and easy. It consists of Batman’s Bat Cycle, Harley’s Hammer Truck, and brand new Batman and Harley Quinn Minifigs. There is also no lack of weapons. In addition to the usual bag of Bat-accessories and guns, the set also comes with a pair of gray revolvers. Batman in this set has the new “armor” torso print and the hips are the same color as the legs, hinting that this is supposed to represent the movie style Batsuits more so then the traditional comic book “underwear over tights” look. Harley Quinn is a very cool looking Minifig, and I haven’t grinned so much at a new Batman character figure since my first Batman Minifig a couple years ago. The figure is very true to the character, and the torso has been accented with a few shape lines to try and distinguish her as a female despite the boxy body. Harley’s jester cap is an interesting new piece. It seems (to me at least) to be made of a slightly different grade of plastic then we’re used to. It’s molded in red and painted with black and white, and it comes packed in its own separate little baggie. I expect that this piece may have cost LEGO a little more then usual to produce. Harley also has a buildable accessory, a giant mallet. Sure, she can’t stand up all that well unless it’s held in specific ways, but it’s neat and most importantly, it’s funny. It’s especially fun for smacking the everloving crap out of other Minifigs with. The Bat Cycle is in bag number one and is a very fast build. This isn’t some little Japanese sport bike like Nightwing’s cycle. This monster is almost a car and seems to pack just the right amount of intimidation for the Caped Crusader to exploit. Thanks to the thick tires (two in front, one in back) it stands up just fine on its own and rolls very well. The huge exhaust pipes are a nice touch and give the thing a look of engine power. The only real flaw is the inclusion of the flick-fire missiles mounted on the sides. But, as with any LEGO model, they can be easily left out without hurting the look of the vehicle. The hammer truck is the bulk of this set and a lot more fun then it looks. Of the monster truck persuasion, the vehicle is designed and built with a surprising level of solidity. The axle mounts are particularly impressive. The big wheels and tires just beg you to drive this thing right over the Bat Cycle (or Batman). The mega-mallet gimmick is also a surprise. Not so much for its technical complexity, there isn’t any really, but for the fact that once you start turning the knob at the rear to swing the mallet back and forth, it’s really a lot of fun. There are some low points to the truck design. Again the flick-fire missiles are tacked on and there’s a cargo crate/bed set into the back for Harley’s loot of jewels. The crate would have looked a lot better molded in black. In brown it breaks up the look of the truck a little. Speaking of which, the look of the truck is very pleasing. The red and black Harley Quinn color scheme works really well on the vehicle. There are a few stickers here, and unfortunately, the diamond patterned ones are applied over multiple bricks. The rest, however, are great. Not only does she have an “I Love Joker” bumper sticker, but she has a Joker playing card taped to her dash, I guess serving as a picture of her beloved Puddin’. There is also a sticker for activation of the hammer, which boldly shouts HIT ME! This is a fun set. A neat new Batman vehicle and a big truck with lots of playability. The Harley Minifig is a must-have for any Bat-Fan and, if you only get one of the Batman sets this year, I’d recommend this one. The price versus piece-count on this set is a little bit of a deterrent though. This might not be the best set for collectors on a budget or people looking for something completely new and innovative, but anyone buying this for a child can rest assured that the kid will get your money’s worth out of the set through its play value. When added together and averaged out, the pros and cons of this set combine to give it a score of out of 5. Even if Harley herself is a clean 6 out of 5

Quote Looking forward to the review, this looks to be the best of the new Batsets. *gasp* Are you kidding me? Honestly, I hate this set. The batbike looks far too blocky, and that Hammer Truck looks super shoddy and thrown together. The only real reason I'd get it at all would be for the Harely Quinn figure - but I'd probably just get her separately on Bricklink. Besides, the Tumbler and Robin's Jetski sets look far better to me. They actually seem to have great vehicle designs. No new villian figures, I know, but still some great old ones. Er, wait a minute... oh yeah, hope your review gives the real scoop on this kit, Deino.

Grevious, on May 30 2008, 05:03 AM, said: *gasp* Are you kidding me? Honestly, I hate this set. The batbike looks far too blocky, and that Hammer Truck looks super shoddy and thrown together. The only real reason I'd get it at all would be for the Harely Quinn figure - but I'd probably just get her separately on Bricklink. Besides, the Tumbler and Robin's Jetski sets look far better to me. They actually seem to have great vehicle designs. No new villian figures, I know, but still some great old ones. Er, wait a minute... oh yeah, hope your review gives the real scoop on this kit, Deino. The batbike may look blocky, but the Hammer Truck is by no means thrown together. Read the instructions, it actually has a great assembly. Add into the fact it has Harley, great wheels, a modable Batbike, awesome stickers and awesome pieces and I'd say this was a win. The Penguin is a bit of a repeat and the Tumbler is too big for me. Either way, it's a great set, Batman 08 wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be, which is great. Batbrick Away!

A very nice review, thanks Deinonychus. That Batcycle looks pretty neat.... like a Hells Bats Angels version of that tumbler, a really nifty idea. The truck looks simply sweet, a smooth design and, this time, TLC´s new habit of vehicle oversizing just works very fine. A wonderful and very comical vehicle indeed! And Harley.... oh my, this bill I´ll have to pay for myself.... Clonecommando007, on May 30 2008, 02:22 PM, said: Truck: Flick fire missiles!!?!?? Lego have you no sanity!

The '08 Batman sets look like a step up from the somewhat lackluster '07 sets. This looks like a very fun set with a whimsical sense of style very fitting with Harley Quinn's character. The price isn't great, but I guess you gotta pay for that Batman logo. On the downside ... I am so over the good buy vehicle vs. bad guy vehicle concept. I really wish TLC would get over this. You see it throughout the product line -- Batman, Castle, Mission to Mars, etc.

Hi all, so I was at "The Wal-Mart" yesterday and had the munchies and was looking for something to eat. Somewhere along the line, I stopped caring about food and decided to browse the toy department to see what they had Lego-wise. Usually, they have jack squat, but on this particular day they had a lot of new sets. I impulsively picked this set up, along with Harley Quinn's Hammer Truck and the new little campsite from the Indy 4 line. I must say, when I first saw images of this set I wasn't exactly thrilled or anything. I mean, I didn't really see anything particularly special about it, but after purchasing it, I must admit that I would consider it a must buy for any Lego fan. But enough babbling about myself. Onward with the review (my first of an official set)! In this picture, you can see everything you get with the set. I thought the box-art was pretty nice looking. The manual, on the other hand, took somewhat of a beating within the box, a common problem with most more recent sets. I do have to say that I wish they would at least make some effort in fixing this. They could just make a little thin cardboard "folder" to minimize bending and tears. For Batman minifig collector's, the highlight of this set are the Robin and Penguin figs. Previously, you could only get them in the pricey Bat-Cave set, but this set provides a much cheaper alternative. One thing you will notice, however, is that Robin's hairpiece is a new mold, as it is actually a black version of Mutt's hair (from the Indy 4 line). Personally, I think it actually looks better than the hairpiece used on the older version of Robin. As the Batcave had before it, this set comes with some bricks to make two cute (but deadly) penguins. They help add more charm to an already charming set. When you're finished building, you'll end up with a nice little assortment of extra parts; 1 black "cheese slope," 3 1x1 tile (black, yellow and white), a revolver, a technic pin, and a 1x1 red round plate. Here's Robin's Scuba Jet. It's nice and sleek looking. Notable parts of interest would probably be the green turbine engines. My only complaint on this one would have to be the use of decals on the 2x2 round yellow tiles. For that type of a part, printing seems as though it would have been the best way to go. Now for, in my opinion, the best part of the set...the Penguin's sub. This set has more decals than Robin's Scuba Jet, but they seem more necessary in this case. I actually wanted to put the decal's on the sub, as I think the it looks great with them. Obviously, it looks like a penguin, but wow, does it ever do it with style! It has a lot of interactive features, the first of which I will mention, being the periscope which raises up and down. And for the collectors of parts in new colors, it has a few parts in medium orange?, such as 2x2 tile. Here's a shot of the bottom of the sub. Another nifty little feature is how you can lift the top off and fit the penguin inside. And there is enough room inside, so that you can firmly place top on again, and without interference to the movement of the periscope. Another little feature is the rear spring-loaded missile. You just tilt the small lever toward the front of the sub, and it fires. And the last small feature are the flick-missiles on each side. Overall, this is a great set with a lot to offer for a decent price. A lot of fans might view the only drawback to it as being the use of decals, but if you plan on keeping the kit together they make it look really fantastic. Buy it if you can.

I´m glad that you changed your mind, a review of a burger wouldn´t be half that interesting for sure. It´s just a mediocre set to me, but of course it´s always cool to get important MFs in less pricy sets. I like the Penguin´s sub from the Batcave more, just because they did a fine job on resembling a penguin without using a sticker.... Robins craft looks fairly nice, but the most useful parts of the whole set, for me personally, would be those indeed very neat green engines.

Unfortunately, I never got my hands on the Batcave set, so I never was able to build the original sub.

Yay, another Technic shooter!! Whew, I need a spare one in case the 14,348 other ones that I have all happen to break. Seriously, do Lego set designers get some sort of bonus for incorporating catapults, Technic shooters, and / or flick-fire missiles??? Anyway, thanks for the review. Looks like a cute set.

Thanks for the review! I love this set, i didn't think it was much at first either, but i really love it. Another cheaper Robin and Penguin is great, and those nifty mini penguins are awesome. The spare pieces are even nice! I love Robin's little scuba jet, those green engines are very nice and I love it compactness. Penguin's sub is even better, at first I was annoyed at getting two subs but now I realise it means I can have a fleet of them I'll be sure to mod over those cannons though, but the details are very slick. Thanks again. Batbrick Away!

Thanks for the great review, Brickadier General! The sub looks very nice, and I like the idea of a raising periscope (did the Batcave sub have that feature?) and the details on the sub look very nice. The inclusion of The Penguin, Robin and two of those great brick-built penguins really confirms that I'll be getting this, considering that I didn't purchase the Batcave. However, I am rather dissapointed that this set is so similar to the vehicles of Penguin and Robinin repectively in the Batcave set. I feel that it only really caters to those who havn't bought the set, and I would've much appreciated different vehicles. Overall, a very nice set, perhaps the best of the 2008 wave, despite it's lack of originality. Thank you very much for the review BG

Set: 8635 - Agents - Mobile Command Center Pieces: 1154 Price: $US89.99 Those dedicated Agents. They've fought chainsaw-armed villains, battled radio-controlled cyborg crocs, chased pallets of badly-stored golden loot and wrestled killer sharks with vicious, toothy grins. Finally they've caught the notorious Dr Inferno and imprisoned him in their cavernous Mobile Command Center. But Dr Inferno won't go down without a fight! Can the Agents stop the evil Dr 'Disco' Inferno fleeing? Will Spy Clops laser gun burn through the door in time, or will Dr Inferno simply use the lovely Agent Trace's enormous ponytail as an escape ladder to freedom? More importantly, will there be a riot in the streets of Lego City as AFOLs go apopletic at the thought of a 12 wide truck roaring through their ordered town layouts? Stay tuned! Part 1: The Box, Instructions, Parts As the largest of the Agents sets (so far), the box is easily the biggest. Trainee agents, examine the following three pics and see if you notice anything odd. Box front: Box back: Box middle: Spot it? That's right. The printed cardboard which has supposed to be the bottom half of the fold out middle section is on the back, slicing the ultra-large set image which would form the foldout in half . The way the cardboard is printed as one piece before it's folded I think this would be very hard to do 'accidentally' so suspect a major stuff-up somewhere along the production line. I bought this set off bricklink so would be very interested if anyone in the States who has seen these boxes actually on the shelves can tell me if this is common or rare. Basically I want to know if I should be annoyed that the bricklink seller didn't list this in the set description, or are they all like this? The instructions come in 4 booklets. The parts list comes in at 5 pages, which is a lot even at half-size pages ! Large images of the parts inventory are in this folderwhen moderated for anyone interested. Here's also some cute Agents-type artwork at the end of one of the books. Instructions show piece call-outs and are divided into sections according to numbered bags. As you'd expect for a set with 1100+ parts, this baby comes with a lot of bags. It's a treasure trove of dark blue. As well as the obvious large slopes and wall panels which make up the body and the roof, there is a wealth of smaller navy blue pieces as well - small 1x1 bricks, 2x2 bricks, 1x1 plates, 2x2 tiles, heaps of 2x plates, some slopes, 22x cheese pieces... basically anyone wanting a lot of dark blue should think about this set. The roof panels alone, for example, could provide a dark blue sea for a modernised Pirate MOC. 2 DSSs (Dreaded Sticker Sheets). Quelle surprise - stickers! The grey parts of the stickers here are metallic silver ink, which is a nice touch. Actually, as sticker sheets go, they're not too bad. Fairly subtle for the most part and the navy blue actually matches the bricks themselves. However, after looking at the sticker sheets I thought I was missing something. What about the pieces used for the projection screens showing Dr Inferno and the sharks - why weren't they on the sticker sheets? There must be another one! Frantically I checked and rechecked the box and flipped through all the instruction manuals to find the elusive 3rd sheet. Where was it? Ten minutes later I noticed something which had honestly never occured to me - THERE WERE ACTUAL PRINTED PIECES IN THIS SET! So obvious and yet so unthinkable. It's horrifying how years and years of Exoforce and Speed Racer set releases can mentally condition people's thought processes. Tut tut, Lego. What have you reduced us to? Here they are, folks - ACTUAL PRINTED PIECES. (Yes, I do believe this news deserves the caps.) I also noticed this nifty modification of the usual 2x3 cupboard - you can now fit drawers in it! Very clever. This may have been around in Belville sets for years for all I know, but it's new to me. The drawers slide in and out very well and the top one sits on slight indentations in the middle of the cupboard. Part 2: The figs! Our trusty agents - Charge, Chase, Trace and Fuse. (High powered agents don't have time for names of more than one syllable - that's why the bad guys always lose ). Chase and Fuse have the Mutt hair in black and dark orange. The lovely Agent Trace has an exquisite new hairpiece in dark brown, perfect for 'Rapunzel' themed MOCs. As you can see, her ponytail is loooong. Makes it hard to sit down, the poor girl. I feel sorry for all these female figs with such intricate hairstyles that they can never relax in an ordinary Lego chair. However, at least she has two breasts unlike the recent Harley Quinn fig. Compensation indeed. Seriously though, it's great that there's a separate torso print for the female character and this attention to detail is typical of the set as a whole. Three of the agents have reversable heads - nice touch with the headsets and I like the ID cards on their pants. Obviously the agents security system is based on some kind of crotch measuring device. This would make sense considering the conspicuous bulges in the pants of Dr Inferno's men (see the other Agents set reviews.) The villains - Spy Clops, Dr Inferno, Gold Tooth. Dr Inferno's hair in all it's glory. This is a great piece, although the orange colouring is a little rough on the front. It's so 3D, it deserves a back and side view (and indeed EB thread) all of its own. As mentioned elsewhere, this is different plastic to the normal minifig hair, but it doesn't quite feel as soft as the Exo-force hair. It doesn't fall off as much, anyway. The figs get 10/10 from me. Awesome hairpieces in great colours for the Agents and a sleek navy blue/ neon green uniform. The villains' faces are great and they are all very distinctive. The attention to detail is outstanding and it's great to see a Lego in-house theme with characters as memorable and cool as figs from the licensed themes . Part 3: The build The build is divided into three stages - the small vehicles, the front of the truck, and the massive command center section. (a) Small vehicles First up, all the small vehicles. We have a small flyer, 2 buggies, jet ski, and a speed boat - all in glorious navy blue with little bits of silver detailing. Top view. These vehicles are all simple, small and well-designed. Probably the weakest is the flyer, only because the cockpit looks a little large. In fact, the small flyer is probably the weakest element of 8365 overall, which tells you how good the set itself is! In various threads here, this set has been heavily criticised for being way out of proportion. There's a reason for that, as we shall come to. However, the existence of these small sets should appease some people. With the new coast guard sets, for example, all of these save the flyer wouldn't look out of place on a City beach with a little modding. Here's an example - agents beach party! (Spongebob couldn't help but crash.) The villains only have one small vehicle, but they've been well-served in the smaller sets, and this one is a unique and clever design. I love the triangular shape and the simple but clever technique of making the arch slopes meet up around the propellers. It's sort of insectile in black and orange, and looks very different from the usual assortment of helicopters etc. (b) Truck front This thing is a beast! Seriously, look at it. It's chunky and mean looking. You don't want to mess with this baby. The build is really nice. Like a lot of Star Wars vehicles, it's all based on technic beams pinned together. Unlike a lot of Mars Mission sets, underneath isn't ALL technic beams with some plates slapped on like a facade. The majority is a lot of plates and bricks which all fit together solidly. You can see from the detailing of 'cheese grater' slopes and silver pieces on the front how effort has been made to give this vehicle a distinct feel different to other Lego sets. Sure, the silver slope mirrors might be a bit too much for some, but this baby is all about attitude. You can imagine it roaring down the road en route to Dr Inferno's diabolical lair! After all, these sets are 'Agents' sets - nobody said they were *secret* Agents (c ) Command center - whole assembly Here's a view of the whole thing assembled - inside and cool details to follow at the end. It's kind of hard to show here as it is extreeeeemely long. This is indeed a big set. The build for the trailer part of the command center is fun and very satisfying. Yes, there are large pieces but there is also a huge amount of detail. It is also solid as a rock. I remember being annoyed building the big Ferrari truck a few years ago - everytime you looked at it, an 8 x 16 plate fell off. The Mobile Command Center is solid - even with the hinged roof and special features, it is not delicate at all. Kudos to the designers, again as it is mainly a brick build rather than a technic one. I also like how the command center part connects to the cabin - it's not a special piece at all, just a technic axle going through two circle plates, but it works and it's solid. (Please note I've been selective about which stickers I've applied during the build.) Top view: The rear: Here's an example of why I like the build: (a) the designers have enough sense to put a ladder so a minifig can climb up to the interior when the command center is open (b) notice that although the ladder clips at the top, there is an *extra* clip there in the middle purely to hold it in place so it doesn't flap around and holds firm. I don't know if most designers would even think to put a ladder there let alone go the extra mile and put a mechanism to hold it in place. Pure class. Oh, and notice the greebly detail stuff to the right there too. The other side. This is probably the other weak part of the build - the bricky gaps at the top where the hinge to open the roof sits. It's a little gappy but the set is so big you don't really notice. (d) And now for the fun stuff - inside and neat details! OK, so we've built the thing. It's big. It's blue. The top of the trailer itself would make a good warehouse MOC for a harbour layout. But what about inside? Is it any good? What about all those small vehicles from the start of the review? Where do they go? Well, I'm glad you asked. Because the solution is superb. The small flyer folds slightly and slides into place here: Lift off the roof and you're away! The large buggy and the speedboat go under here: The jetski slides out of the rear here, attached to its own little platform: And the small buggy goes inside the main cabin. There's even a crane so you can lift it down. So now we know why this set is so large! To fit everything in! It's amazing that this functionality doesn't affect the aesthetics of the set as a whole. But we still haven't finished on the details. The front section has a very easy-to-swing-open roof section and missiles: There's also a command section underneath the bit where the flyer lifts out: And now for the interior. I have to say I really like this space. Not only is it packed with great stuff, there's also enough room for minifigs to move around. I hate bases where the figs only have about 2 studs to actually stand and walk. Aquabase Invasion is a nice set, for example, but the actual functional space inside the base is teensy. Claustrophobia! You know within a week they'd be fighting to toss each other out of the airlock. No such problems for these suave Agents, who have plenty of legroom *and* the ability to launch missiles from their ceiling. The whole of the interior: Zooming in: Moving from left to right. First off, the medicine cabinet. Looks like someone's been leaving secret mission dossiers lying around. The projector area for mission briefings. Dr Inferno recently changed his hair colour from purple to orange, it seems. Why are all these minifigs so obsessed with their hair? The projector folds down when the trailer is open. Push the button and the light glows on. Now Dr Inferno's hair is orange again! This is one of my favourite parts of the set. It works a charm. The batteries for these lightbricks can also be replaced - instructions are in the manual. Agent Charge considers shark-fin soup for dinner. Did I mention these projection panels are printed? The detail is very fine too. The tool section. Laptops sit in the middle compartment. You get some flippers, yellow scuba tank and various implements. I'm so impressed that the helmet is pearl silver with a different coloured visor too - there's so much variation in the parts in this set, you don't get the sense the designers are using the same thing over and over to save money. It all feels luxe and top-of-the-line, just like the Command Center itself. Two laptops - yay! The aforementioned rooftop missiles: The Dr Inferno cage. Nasty electric shocks! Bzzt! (You can see my reviewing skills are burning out now - sentences.... truncated...) Another example of detail - nowhere else in the set is a 1x1 transgreen tile used - they could have used a 1x1 trans green cheese wedge piece as there are others in the set, but they didn't. How does Dr I get out? Flick that lever on the right hand exterior and the door pops open. Spy Clops the loyal minion awaits his master on the other side. And there we have it. Take a bow, guys! There's a lot of spare parts. A suspicious amount of dark blue small slopes but I checked the instructions and didn't see anything missing. I have to say, I do like the new policy (since Speed Racer I think) of including these small slopes as extras. Part 4: Overall Rating If you've made it this far, you've got more stamina than Dr Inferno's army of cyborg animals themselves! As I said earlier, this set has drawn criticism for the size of the truck. However, large vehicles do exist - I grew up in a wheat farming area and as a kid the size of the lorries that thundered past carrying grain was probably intimidating to me as this monstrous espionage machine is to the good citizens of Lego City! On top of that, it *does* contain a plethora of 4-wide vehicles inside ! Criticism of this set on the basis of size to me also seems misguided as this is basically a playset - and it is a very good one to boot. As you can probably tell, I love it to pieces and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone, whether for parts or for play value. Check out the parts list in this folderwhen moderated and you can see just how many excellent pieces it contains. A light-up brick, a flood of navy blue, metallic silver bricks - we're spoiled. 8635 is also an enjoyable build, with fantastic figs and top-of-the-line detailing. In a year when I've found City a bit disappointing after the run of great sets in 2006-2007, the Agents line has been one of the surprise hits for me and I can't wait to see what the designers come up with next.

Man, tohse mini vehicles and minifigs are sexy as all heck! I love Dr.Inferno and the female pattern for Agent trace (is it just me or she almost "busting out"? ). I love the Dr. Inferno hair, and the reappearance of Spy-Clops and Gold Tooth is simply gold (yes yes, pun intended!) I have to say this is shaping up to be one of my favourite sets, well, ever! Batbrick Away!

You know I like many had doubt's about these sets when they were first mentioned, but I've decided I want the whole line now! This set is the créme de la créme. Just beautifully stunning! That is a great review svelte_corps, you have gone into fantastic detail and description of all the elements. Really it is this review that has persuaded me to buy this set. I blame you! The minifigs are great, the vehicles are better, and the truck and interior is awesome! The few minor draw backs are far outweighed by the attention to detail and the many unique and cool elements used in this set. And printed pieces! That is even better! Great job, you have obviously put a tremendous effort in making this review, and I for one definitely appreciate it! I am looking forward to these sets being available in New Zealand!

MUST. GET. TWO Thanks so much, this review has truly shown this set as a brilliant one. Even those who hate this theme must admit it is greatly designed. I love the way the mini vehicles fit. I love the light brick. I love the truck front. I love the trailer. I love the missions bay. I love holding cell. I love everything!

Wow. Like others have said i was unsure about these when i first heard about them but then looked at the first leaked pics and thought they actually look pretty neat. now i have seen all the reviews i have to have all these sets. at first i was thinking they would be great as parts packs but the more reviews i see the less i want to use them as part packs and just keep them as built (or buy 2 so i can do both !!) Can't wait till they hit the shelves in the UK...... Thanks for the review

Thanks for another wonderful review, svelte_corps A very fine set indeed, I absolutely love the way all of the vehicles fit into the command centre, very clever. The projector is really cool, it looks very nice. It's great to see these light and sound bricks in the Agents sets. All of the little nooks and crannies in the centre are great too, I really love the amount of detail featured, mixed with all of the playability of this set. The minifigs - as usual - are brilliant, the uniforms look fantastic. Dr Inferno looks especially great, I love his white suit with hints of orange, and who can forget his hair? I'm really tempted to buy this beast now, though I'm not sure my wallet will forgive me for it. I suppose I'll have to cut back on Indy and Castle multiples for now... Thanks for the truly great review, svelte_corps, nice work

Wow this set looks so amazing! Amazing! Genius! Da'vinci art I say! You've done an excellent job reviewing, and really, this is the review I've been waiting for. So cool! So classy! I love the mission briefing feature. To think that lego could go so high as to put something ingenious like that in there! Too bad Lego figures don't have fingers to make shadow shows, eh? Genius! The Jet lauching feature is pretty slick, and they even put a control center in there too! That's beast. Loving that. The bottom...I don't see how that big buggy can get out or in there, but, Awesome too! The back of the truck could use more detailing I think, but the jail pop-open feature is pretty cool, as is the speed boat storage rack. Cabin; it's great! That roof opening feature is a great part of this set. Also I think you can have multiple figures up there...maybe you can mod it to put a bed in there! It certainly looks big enough! Inferno plane, wow that think is smooth, baby! I love how the wings contain rotors inside of them!!! That's awesome detail right there. That is a sweet ship thingy, so slick. The rest of the command center is pretty awesome too; we get a 4x4 wheeler and a crane, and lots of room! Wow! Just wow! Great review, great set! You are well worthy of your custom title! I'm gonna go buy this for only $90!!!! WOOT!

Great Review, thanks! That's one hell of a set. I think LEGO has reached a certain kind of peak with the design, cleverness, and fun of this one. I'm so relieved that Agents seems to be shaping up to be even better then I thought it was going to be...and I thought it was going to be cool to begin with. Agent "Charge"? Not only does he look like Dash Justice, but he has the name of one of Dash's Alpha Team squadmates? I call shenanigans!

Wonderful review - one of the best I've ever seen on this site. Man, we thought this might be the weakest set in the line, but it turns out it may be the strongest! Everything about this set - from the color scheme to all the details to the minifigures to the piece selection - is just wonderful! I think this set has finally confirmed it: Agents is everything Alpha Team wasn't, and is how they should have done a spy theme from the start. Kudos to TLC for finally getting it right - and I sure hope there's a second year!

I first I thought the whole Agents line would not be very good. But boy have I changed my mind! This set looks amazing, as do all of the other sets in the line. I really like how the small vehicles all fit into the truck. I don't like it when sets come with smaller vehicles and don't have anywhere to store them, so they just float on the side. That light projector is fantastic! I can't believe they are actually printed! This is definitly on my to-buy list! Thanks for the amazing review!

7645 - MT-61 Crystal Reaper Piece count: 600 Price: $AUD79.95, 49.95 Euros (in most countries), 39.99 GBP, USD 49.99 It's happened in the wider world, and it had to happen to Lego - yes, the 80s are back. Space invaders, holograms, compulsory seat-belt wearing legislation, and the return of classic Space. Ok, we don't have a fully fledged classic space theme back yet, but if 7645 is the way of the future, I think Lego is ready to do it properly. I wasn't a huge fan of last year's Mars Mission sets and only picked up a few on clearance, but this set is light years (excuse the pun) ahead of 2007's offerings. This mining vehicle is solid, compact, and well-designed. It looks impressive, and even better, it has fantastic Power Functions operability! Behold 7645 - MT-61 Crystal Reaper! (PS I wasn't joking about the holograms or seat belts.) Part 1: Box, Instructions, DSSs (Dreaded Sticker Sheets), Parts Front of box: Back of box: 2 x instruction booklets: DSS numero uno - for the Reaper DSS number two - apologies for the blurry pic but I wanted to capture the sweet shimmy of the metallic holographic background on this sheet The way it catches the light really makes a difference to the small alien craft and makes it look much more interesting from the plain stickers of last year. There's heaps of spare silvery stuff once the stickers are applied for those who use the leftover sticker material for customising. Parts bags - 4 numbered with one extra with larger pieces Parts everywhere - woo! I know the Lego instruction books scold me if I mix bags, but I'm a devil-may-care kind of guy. In your face, TLC. I love mixing all the parts together before I build, it reminds me of my youth when the days were long, anything was possible, and I didn't need strict instructions not to build on grass or poke my eye out with a technic shooter. Interesting parts - these may or may not be new, my technic knowledge is not that detailed. The little scoop parts are so cute and have a heap of potential uses. I love 'em. They're like Smurf hats at Miniland scale. These technic wheel things in orange are also cute. They kind of remind me of marigolds. Giant Fabuland marigolds! The track pieces - you get 70 of these - here's the section of track for one side - as you can see it's about 52 studs long. These hold together better than the small ones on the Hailfire Droid/ Jungle Cutter. Part 2: Minifigs, small mining transport, alien ship I have to confess - I forgot to take an individual snap of the astronauts . It's the usual bunch though - Scaredy Face guy, Sunglasses in Space Man and a third one I can't remember. You don't really care, though? You're only interested in the alien commander and his matching arms/ legs combo deal. As brickbitz noted in his review of the smaller set, the glowy eye is just a 1x1 cylinder. The set also comes with 2 normal jellies - one pictured here for size. You'll see what happened to the other one soon enough... The alien craft is nothing exciting, apart from the gorgeous glinting stickers. Here's the road safety angle. The commander actually clips onto a 1x2 plate with handle so he can't fall out! Then the lime tentacle thing descends on top of him to keep him firmly there, like a baby seat. Not very brave for an alien commander, is he? I mean, did Darth Vader ever use a seatbelt? Tssk. With cradle up: This part of the build also includes the small astronaut mining buggy - small and effective. (Please note in this build I've applied stickers to everything bar cockpit pieces.) This comes with radio and saw piece. Part 3: The Reaper! The first part of the build is the detachable shuttle. I really like the retro aesthetic of this with the angled wings and the side hoverpod things. It is much better than the comparable vehicle from 7699. The new flickfire piece is a waste of space - it's fairly limp. I prefer the simple flickfire technic pin to be honest. There's also a very nice little side workshop as you can see. I really like how the control unit is 'plugged' into the wall via 5 1x1 round plates (third pic, it's a bit dark). Great detail. [The technic pins on the back are there to connect the Power Functions battery box. It's odd they're included at this stage of the instructions - maybe the intention was to release it originally with all the necessary motors etc but the price point was too high and they scaled it back] The base. The shuttle sits on that bley technic axle in the middle when the Reaper is fully assembled. The little vehicle scoots down the ramp at the rear, which folds up to hold it in place when the Reaper is in motion. You can see there's a crystal container here as well - another nice small detail which I found the 2007 sets lacked. There's also an alien here - thankfully not in those horrendous trans-orange tubes so prevalent last year. The complete assembly. Isn't it snug? It's just the right size too - not massive but large enough to be a serious mining vehicle. The ominous black treads contrast nicely with the white/ orange colour scheme of the vehicle itself. The trans detailing - blue for weapons, neon green for energy - is carried nicely through the whole set. The blades and the scoops whirl nicely as the machine trundles along. Top down view: Tread detail: Whirling blades of death! The buggy descends: Probably the most disturbing aspect of the whole set is this pic: The jelly has an orange pump plugged into its heart which is connected to an energy supply on the left hand side! This vehicle runs on alien jelly juice! Either that or it's milking the jelly in some equally disturbing fashion. How amoral is that! I know there's been debate about this - the jellys aren't innocent, they're evil energy crystal thieving maniacs etc - but I find it a bit odd that the humans respond by chaining the jelly up to the bowels of their mining vehcile and suck energy from its heart. People debate about violence in Lego as represented by realistic minifig weapons, but I think the moral lesson here is even worse - it's OK to exploit foreign life forms for our own gain if they treat us badly first! (Who-fans, I think the Ood should have a word with the jelly Commander ) That aside, this set is well-designed and fairly good value at $AUD79.95. It's definitely a notch above last year's Mars Mission sets overall, with improved detailing and more useful functions. The holo-stickers are fab and it's nice to have an alien commander, even if he is a bit bulky and his fingers are identical to his toes. However, if all these reasons by themselves weren't reason to recomend this set, the following is.... Part 4: Power Functions The best part of this set - and the reason I bought it, really - is the integration of Power Functions. Bizarrely this isn't mentioned at all on the box and I only found out about it from the instructions when they were posted on Eurobricks! (Instructions for book 2 which has the Power function stuff available here.) This is a great idea and hopefully we will see more new sets take this kind of approach (especially with the new Train sets). Luckily I got Monster Dino 4958 on sale for half price earlier this year so already had most of the necessary motors etc - the only one needed was an extra small one. What you need is listed in the instructions below with redirections to Shop @ Home to buy the motors. Note there's actually a mistake on this page. The 2 small motors you need are both 8883 not 8882 (which is the large XL motor). Way to confuse the kids there, Lego! Attaching them was a dream and only took a few minutes (In contrast to 4958 where it was almost impossible to remove motor elements without dismantling the model). Basically the back platform and some plates and orange slopes come off, you attach the motors, and then the smaller plates go back on. These parts are now left loose: Overall the look of the Reaper isn't badly effected as you're mainly viewing from the front anyway: Sadly I can't show you how it moves, you'll just have to trust me that it does ! The way it is steered is demonsrated in the instruction pages above. Basically each motor is controlled by a corresponding switch on the remote. Move them both forward to move forward, move one right to turn right, move both back to move back etc. It zips along! It's a speedy little thing! Personally I wouldn't want to be in it's path as it comes roaring down the Martian canyon! (My cat was scared as it was.) It is oodles of fun and definitely worth trying if you have the motors or can get them cheaply, and adds a whole new dimension to the 'play' aspect of 'playset'. It is also as I said very quick to switch between modded and non-modded Reaper in contrast to the more fiddly Dino creations. The only problem I had is that if it moves too fast, the weight of the battery box at the back tends to pull the whole thing back and it rears up. It does correct itself though. I only trialled this on carpet last night so it may behave differently on other surfaces - I will need to experiment! Part 5: Summation This is a great set made even better with the addition of Power Functions. At $AUD79.95 it's well-priced. Buy it! Buy the motors as well (K-Mart still has stock of 4958 at $89, wait for a 15% off sale)! You won't regret it. Buy 2 and make competing battle machines! The only thing is... just don't torture that poor jelly Edited by Sinner, 24 June 2008 - 03:25 AM.

Another great review. I'm looking forward to getting this set sometime soon. I wasn't aware of the power function aspect, similar I suppose to the old technic sets which had an additional instructions for those with the relevant motors. I knew those dino's I got at clearance would come in useful. Nice to see the recent "bulldozer" treads appearing in black. Grey seemed a slightly unusual colour choice.

These new sets are just totally off-the-wall radical :D. It's the little details like the scoops on the blades and the alternate alien energy source (Lego didn't even have to include those, but they did!) that show Lego are really getting back into their groove this year. The ability to add power functions is just so cool as well, I'm going to pick-up the Creator Monster Dino set for the electronics when the sales hit as svelte has suggested. A very entertaining review, just like the Agents mobile command center one :D

Only from S@H so far, or if you buy sets which they come in. All the ones you need (apart from one additional small motor) are available in the 4958 Monster Dino set (which I got half price). I ordered the extra from S@H at the same time I bought the set - but only because I had already looked at the instructions and knew what I needed. (If people have the Ferris Wheel set as well I think the small motor comes in that.)

Well, title says it. The description, you'll understand later. I ordered this off of S@H last tuesday, and oddly enough, it's listed on S@H as MX-81 Hypersonic Airplane... I'd like to apologize for the random, horrible, faded pics. I took the review outside, and the clouds kept shifting, changing the lighting, and then I had to go inside because it started raining. It's been raining for a week. It's raining now, as I type this. So, I foolishly went outside to take pics. The front of the box. Not bad, as far as boxes go. It features a lift-up tab... ...which shows the various functions. Back of the box. Still not much to say... Two manuals. I think this is just right- Not too thick, but not too many manuals, either... Oddly enough, the box came with a little folded up piece of paper telling us not to mix the bags. It comes sorted into 4 bags, by the way. Minifigures The set features 3 normal MM figs, 1 normal jellie, and one of the new commanders. I really like this guy. He has a few issues, like his hands being stuck sideways, and still being hollow, but still a great improvement. He'll make a lovely addition to any Halloween MOC. Stickers The set comes with a fairly big DSS for the Spacecraft. Pretty normal, but I do like the dragon sticker. Then, suprises of suprises, a technicolor sticker sheet for the aliens! How cool is this, huh? The tops of the actual stickers are shiny, which is hard to see in the pic. Even the bottom is shiny! Who said stickers can't be cool? The mining craft The little guy is pretty cute, and well built. My only gripe is that there's nowhere to spin the drill! It seems so lifeless without a feature... The alien craft You'd think a Commander would be important enough to have a seatbelt, rather than be stabbed with a clip and stuck on the ship like those other grunt aliens... I think this thing has some potential. Shiny stickers, different body shape. And when you look at those engines, this thing could be an alien Corvette! But then you look at the back. Pretty bare, no flares or anything. It's a cool little craft, but it just...lacks. The modules These things have some potential, as well. With some modding, they could be pretty cool. Unfortunetly, it's pretty boxy, there are no engines, and the wings are too small. The top is pretty nice, though. The greebles are all right. The controls, as usual, are a sticker. Pretty spacious, mind you. The cockpit doesn't stay flush with the body, though. The front plate underneath it can be easily replaced with a brick to fix that. ...I'm not gonna comment on this. The main body Too bad. The 'labratory' isn't much of a lab. A trans-red panel and some tray thing are all that compose the 'lab'. I was expecting more, but true to form, this Mars Mission set has no impressive interior to speak of. There is a lot of space, though, so it shouldn't be hard to mod. Phew! The lab folds up like so. Pretty simple, and would allow access to the lab, if there was one. And then we have this thing. What is it? Defense laser? Communications array? Satellite T.V.? The modules connect like so (sorry, out of place...): Too bad the pins stick out... Various pics... As you can see, this thing has more of those bars than an AT&T commercial... (There, you understand the topic description now? ) The rear. It uses a white City plane wing for the...wings. When I first saw the prototype pics, I thought they slanted downwards... That would've been really cool. Ah, now to the platform. From the position of the drill, I think this could be a really cool turret location when I MOD it to more military space. Back to the bars. If we had space monkeys, they'd love this. This set has more bars than a jungle gym.( ) Here we see the button that drops the platform. Pretty clever, and it's not in the way. Best of all, it really works! Really well, actually. Good job, TLC. 2 more bars and a shooter mechanism. Jeeze, this is really setting itself up for a joke. A shooter mechanism walks into a bar... Never mind! Here we have the handle that allows you to pick it up safely. A good idea, but it's placed waaaay to far back, way off the center of balance. You have to hold on to it pretty well to keep it angled up, though it does stop your hands from getting in the way of the platform. Ah! The platform in action. This is really a neat little feature. Not only can the ship land in a reduced footprint, but it also prevents the nice white paint job from getting red dust all over it... It's centered pretty well, too, and you don't have to worry about knocking it over, just don't shove it back at all. Here we have the latch. When the button on top is pushed, this gets pulled inward... ...Which pulls out of this hole and allows it to swing neatly down. Good luck, and happy mining!! Again, sorry for the lack of in-progress review. I would've liked to take pics of the mechanism and so on, but typical of the MM sets, you can't really take it apart. Well, this is really a nice set, which can hopefully be upgraded with a better lab with little difficulty. Some of my military mod plans include: -Strip the lab and install a command center -get rid of lots of bars. The thing has more bars than Alcatraz. -Install some turrets. This is a big command ship, so why all the forward-facing weapons? It'll need some AA defense... -mod the landing platform to be a troop dropper with installable AA turret. -mod the cockpit pods to be more aerodymic. So, that's all folks. Shall I include one last "bar" joke?

I appreciate your review Mr. Mandalorian, but why the negativity?. I'd try to find more positives about the set instead of kinda criticizing it after each picture. I personally think it looks freakin' awesome!. The size is very impresive and I nearly fell of my chair when I saw the first pics earlier this year. It's quite unlike anything I've ever seen from Lego. Edited by radiant7, 04 June 2008 - 08:27 AM.

Thanks for the review, Mr. Mandalorian! This is an, er, interesting set. Lots of frontal fire-power. Very big too, and I like the idea of those two little craft that attach on the sides. Sort of like little escape pod things. Anywho, not one of the things on my to buy list, but I do like that radio-active sticker, that could come in use. Looking forward to seeing your modifications, too! ~Peace

Thanks for the great and very detailed review. I love the new holostickers! I'm still not sold on this set though. I'm not sure why... I think it's the big wing piece and the too-technicy build (from looking at the instructions). The platform seems kind of out of place. And for the size of the set, the functionality doesn't seem as good as it could be. It reminds me of 7699 Armored Drilling Unit - looks impressive but doesn't seem to do that much. I do think Mars Mission has improved this year though. Bar none, this is the weakest of the new MM sets I think.

Thanks for the review Mr. Mandalorian. The Alien craft is a bit small in my opinion could have done with being just a little bit larger. The main craft however despite its few minor flaws looks very good. While space isn’t my normal theme I’m certainly being tempted this year.

Thats the observation I had when I saw the first pictures of this set online a few months ago. I am a proud owner of the 6973 Deep Freeze Defender and 6980 Galaxy Commander, so I'm looking forward to see how the 7644 stacks up next to them. There is a definite lineage here, and these sets clearly demonstrate the evolution of Lego set design over the years. The MX-81 may not have the most playability out of all the new MM sets (although it has ALOT from what I can tell), but its hard to beat the look of a large sleek space cruiser sitting on your shelf or dresser, at least for myself.

Thanks for the review. I have to concede this does appear to be the weakest set of the summer MM lineup. I've noticed a trend that the larger sets have plenty of parts potential but when assembled the model is not more than the sum of the parts... Eagle Base certainly didn't seem worth the asking price, at least this is one large model. On a positive note the lame aero tubes, darts and martian carrier pods have disappeared. Don't get me wrong, I love MM and most of the lineup is great, this one just seems to fall a little short of the BAR.

I don't understand why there's so much negativity... this is actually my favorite of the new MM sets. The finished look is very sleek and not very gappy at all. The deployable landing pad is great, and it'll make it easy to put on a shelf without taking too much room. Lots of greebles... although I will concede that it's just begging to be modded. Still, though, I'm definitely buying this one. :) It has a really great look to it!

Great review, Mr. Boba Fett. I really like this set a lot. Some of the features may not be as good as I hoped they would, but overall this looks to be a really nice set. I'm so happy that the giant spacecrafts are finally back. Quote I've noticed a trend that the larger sets have plenty of parts potential but when assembled the model is not more than the sum of the parts... Eagle Base certainly didn't seem worth the asking price, at least this is one large model. On a positive note the lame aero tubes, darts and martian carrier pods have disappeared. Hm, actually, I don't see the comparison. Eagle base looked terible to me right from the start, so it was no suprise when it ended up being the weakest kit in the first year. This big ship, on the other hand, looked great as soon as I saw it, and still looks good.

Iron Moose, on Jun 4 2008, 02:15 PM, said: Do tell. (I'm being curious, not confrontational. ) Well, first and foremost like many other people I'm no fan of those dreaded unprinted minifig torsos and stickers. But also the cost to piece ratio of the set, it just seems too expensive for everything that you get, such as too many small parts and a lighter than usual piece count for the price. Though if it had included printed minifigs and other elements, I maybe would of been able to swallow its 100 USD cost a little easier. But Star Justice is still Lego SPACE in the most classic sense thats available today, and I will probably pony it up just because... Anyway, I hope were not breaking Forum protocol by not discussing the 7644 review of the original poster or that particular set in general.

Thanks for the review. I actually quite like this. I can't afford it, so I'm not getting too attached to it, but in its own way, it's great. It's certainly reminiscent of Space sets of the past, as others have said, and the drop-down ramp section is just really cool. As an idea, you understand. Sure, the lab is a little crap, but at least the effort was made (sort of ). The sheer fact that it's so big though, really makes me like this. There's just something appealing about large spaceships. Not capital ships, just big space ships. With lots of guns!

Thank you for that nice review, Mr. Mandalorian. Wow. Somehow it´s almost like Classic Space´s back indeed.... It´s a great star ship. It looks stream lined, original and impressive and even the huge plane wing part looks rather cool and smooth on it. It´s equipped at least with some kind of engines on top of the wings and although they´re made with only two a little 'juniorized' parts it´s better than nothing. There´s a lab or some sort of engine room with enough space inside to allow one or two MFs to play Scotty.... yeah! The two cockpits´re nicely detailed with a cool use of these orange 1x1 round plates and to detach one or all two of them reminds a lot of the playability of the good old Space sets. It seems even like it´s easy to attach them to some kind of Cloud City Twin-Pod Car thanks these hinged wings. Looks like some solid fun to me. Of course.... the cockpits aren´t airtight and even this reminds unfortunately of the post blue, grey and trans yellow era of CS. Anyway, there´s no real fun without some MODing I guess. Another great advantage of the set´s that it´s not overpacked with shooting things. One technic shooter, cool in grey and only one trans orange prison pod too. Well, I can surely live with that especially since it´s nicely asymmetrical. The drill rover´s very charming, a little like a rebuilt Oldsmobile Convertibe stranded on Mars. Sweet! And that platform feature´s plain nifty and well done too, very playable and useable for a lot of things. Hmm.... recently I complained a lot about the dense use of studless technic beams for the inner structure of vehicles like these ExoForce tanks par exemple which makes MODing (in an economical way) pretty frustrating.... but the beams here´re used in a very proper way. It should be fairly easy to MOD, let´s say, the back of that lab section up to perhaps even the cockpits to create a larger airtight area that could be boarded from the platform.... just to fit this certain spacers need for, um, realism.... There´re many more nice details too like that 'satelite t.v.' thingy and that cylinder with trans blue 2x2 dish for the knob or these cylinders with cones on that handle, and that Alien craft´s pretty nice and detailed as well. Like I said before.... I really feel like Classic Space´s back.

It brings a real feel of Classic Space to MM (No, I'm NOT talking in the third person. ). However, it does have its own small issues, which are nothing, really. I said that there's not much of a lab- but that's the beauty of lego. There's a lot of room in the ship, so it should be a piece of cake to mod to a bigger lab. Too many bars? I'll take them off. I really like the set, I just want to change it to suit my tastes. It looks beautiful- It will find a home among my other MM sets as a favorite. Iron Moose: Good question. It's about 17 inches wide, 11 inches tall (with ramp down), and 16 inches wide. As for the platform, it's pretty stable. It tilts back a small degree so it doesn't collapse when tapped on the nose, but I wouldn't leave it on the edge of a table while in that position.

Sorry Mr. Mandalorian, I guess I was just getting a bit defensive because when this set first appeared here, there were literally 2 pages of people just bagging out the new MM sets (but then the thread took a turn and people started to warm to them, much like the Agents). I do agree that it definitely needs some MOCing, but with that work I think it has the potential to be a really amazing set in terms of what you could cram into it. The lab is a little disappointing, I've always wanted an enclosed cabin space in a vehicle this size because then all the little space guys can have a true meeting place! The drop-down landing ramp is my favourite part, it has lots of potential uses. Maybe it's even possible to integrate pneumatics :D

Hello SheFOLS and AFOLS, as well as TFOLS, welcome to EB News Reviews, I am your host...For tonight anyway... Shadows will take over after this episode, if we make more... Today we are reviewing Mars Impulse sets 5616 and 5617. Starting with 5617 Alien Jet, I must say it is a small and quick build, the jellie, is made of hard plastic, which surprised me, as I had expected Jellies to be a soft plastic. The jet is mainly 2x4 plates, some swingy hinges, the "seatbelt" and a thing which I cannot seem to name My one gripe about it is that the Jelly cant see where he is flying, it looks better with a MF in it. There was a red 1x1 as a spare part. We move on to the 5616 Mini Robot, which is basically a "safe" brick, with binoculars, soem cheese slopes, little arms, and legs. The best part i must say was the metal detector and "safe" brick, as these seem to be quite rare in sets (By my knowlage anyway). The austronaut has a face, shown in Dr. Sinsters review. The set also comes with a pick-axe and lime green gem. Extra peices where a cheese slope, a green 1x1 and a white droid arm. That concludes these mini-reviews. I also will use this opportunity to show my photo setup. Both sets are reccomended, if you either need a army, or are just trying to get a variaty of figs like myself.

Hello all Eurobricks members, I will be presenting my first review on one of the Harry Potter's set. Firstly, I must emphasize that I am not a very big Harry Potter fan or owned many Harry Potter sets. For this review, I will be highlighting what is the beauty of this small little set, and the reasons to own multiple sets of it. Comments and critics are strongly welcomed. This set is featured in the Harry Potter movie, Prisoner of Azkaban. This set is orignally released in 2004, align with the Harry Potter's movie. This was actually one of the movie scene where Buckbeak the griffin is appeared in the movie. The group of students are supposed to be having up close and personal with him. However, Draco decided to disturb our lovely Buckbeak. Enough of this movie synopsis, I am sure fans of Harry Potter will know this better. Box art Featured mini-fig/creature Background scene The scene is a simple garden, which had a very good mixture of spare parts for your MOCs building. On its own, there is nothing outstanding about this set, except for the griffin. You can buy multiple sets for the griffin alone and for Draco mini-fig. Well, you don't need lots of Draco. But for Castle lovers, black cap are exceptionally useful, at least from my view. Now, I will point out the following why this sets is so great for other reasons. Hidden cover Note that, this is the only mechanism which you can find in this set. It looks rather simple but quite useful. There are some little things hide in it too. Greens, Foilage and Brown parts Needless to say much, it offer 3 foilage, a green plant, 3 brown slopes, 2 ideal bricks and 1x1 brown brick for building a tree. Great for jungle building, forest building and etc. I am sure there are many builders will look out for these. Interesting parts It comes with a wizard book, owl, 2 printed tiles with a spider and stone prints on it. The far right, seriously I don't find any good use for it. Can any EB members enlighten me on that gray thing on the right? Grey parts It comes with a good 10 x 4 green plate. Useful for adding as a platform. Some more grey slopes for your MOCs. There you have it, Draco encounter with Buckbeak comparing with Deep Forest Ambush As you may remembered recently, there was an impulse set competition. One of my entries, which is under the History theme. The Deep Forest Ambush was firstly inspired by this set, and made an improvement out of it. Look at the improved tree compared with the orignal. Summary review Playability: 4/10 (Not much to play with, except swooshing around the Griffin) Design: 5/10 (Too simple and its defintely not related with the movie scene) Parts: 10/10 (Great for parts, explained by the review. A great deal of green and brown parts) Price: 9/10 (An inexpensive set based on the 2004 pricing) Overall: 7/10 (A must have for all Harry Potter fans and collectors whom needs a great use of green and brown parts) Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. More pictures can be found in My Brickshelf (When moderated) Let the Potter magic begans! Edited by WhiteFang, 09 June 2008 - 02:45 PM.

A very nice little review of a pretty nice little set that I wish I'd bought between 1 and 10 of. Just for the griffin. Oh well. Your review has shown me that it's useful for more than just that, so maybe I'll try to pick one up someday. Can't have too many black capes, books, or printed things. Speaking of which: WhiteFang, on Jun 9 2008, 09:41 AM, said: Interesting parts It comes with a wizard book, owl, 2 printed tiles with a spider and stone prints on it. The far right, seriously I don't find any good use for it. Can any EB members enlighten me on that gray thing on the right? The gray thing is technically a plume, like any castle plume, except in this case it's a feather (presumably from the griffin), and made from the mold to the old Indian feathers in the Wild West sets. It's a case of an old part coming back for a slightly new use, in a new colour. Beyond that, the "stone print" tile is a bundle or rolled up blanket or package, depending on where it's used. I don't think it's ever meant to be a stone. It was used as a rolled up pack on the back of the Star Wars speederbikes, for example. Nice pics, plenty of useful information. I'd give this review an A+ Thanks for doing it!

This is one of the few sets I've bought more than one (2!) of. It has a really good selection of pieces, and your review really does it justice, WhiteFang. Multiple Hippogriff/Griffins On! Edited by Shoc, 11 June 2008 - 05:58 PM.

Thanks for that nice review of a really interesting and pretty cool set. At least, a Griffin, I guess, is pretty close to an unicorn or a dragon, huh?

Thanks for the nice review - it was one of the first ones I got when emerging from my dark ages . I bought two of these, just for Buckbeack - I thought he would make a good statue in a Persian temple type MOC. I also liked the minifig head pumpkin and plant part in bright green - both new pieces to me at the time. All in all, it was a good castle or forest building set with a nice selection of pieces for rocks, grass, plants and trees. The dark bley plume piece also now appears in the 10185 Green Grocer set as detailing on the roof of the turret.

Guys, thanks for your kind comments! I am glad that you have enjoyed this review. For this set, I think I bought about 7 to 8 sets, all for the griffins. It's used for my griffin riders in my Castle collection. Now, the green and brown parts come in very handy for Castle MOCs too. imperialshadows, on Jun 9 2008, 11:13 PM, said: A very nice little review of a pretty nice little set that I wish I'd bought between 1 and 10 of. Just for the griffin. Oh well. Your review has shown me that it's useful for more than just that, so maybe I'll try to pick one up someday. Can't have too many black capes, books, or printed things. Speaking of which: The gray thing is technically a plume, like any castle plume, except in this case it's a feather (presumably from the griffin), and made from the mold to the old Indian feathers in the Wild West sets. It's a case of an old part coming back for a slightly new use, in a new colour. Beyond that, the "stone print" tile is a bundle or rolled up blanket or package, depending on where it's used. I don't think it's ever meant to be a stone. It was used as a rolled up pack on the back of the Star Wars speederbikes, for example. Nice pics, plenty of useful information. I'd give this review an A+ Thanks for doing it! I am very happy that you enjoyed and find my review useful. Thanks for enlighten me. Now, I know where is the origin of that gray plume. I wonder if I can use it to match with my castle knights as its plume. In addition, I mistook the rolled up pack as the stone print tile. Why didn't I think of it? I must have overlook it, and used it as a stone tile instead. Nevertheless, I am glad you have give me some good insights on the parts that I am not familar with. svelte_corps, on Jun 10 2008, 10:49 AM, said: Thanks for the nice review - it was one of the first ones I got when emerging from my dark ages .

I find this concept very interesting. Yes, I agreed that this set offers new parts at that time. Personally, I pretty like the green plant. Good for any kind of terrain settings. I did not realise that the dark bley plume piece appear in the Green Grocer. Thanks for pointing out. Edited by WhiteFang, 10 June 2008 - 03:39 AM.

Ohhh great idea to review the "old" Potter sets! Especially the line from Prisoner of Azkaban... I was in my Dark Ages then. Luckily I was able to catch up on the missed figs with one internet order. This Draco is the best TLC has made, if you ask me. The new one (also doubling for Belloq and "guards" in the Indy line) doesn't look quite as hautain as this one. Buckbeak looks cool. Looks like his neck/head can be moved, right? Rather similar to LEGO horses. Well designed. The orange brick doesn't have a pumpkin face on it, right? Unlike the one from Philosopher's Stone in the set with the troll. I'm looking forward to more reviews by you, sir WhiteFang! Good work

Good work No printed face on the pumpkin since the event didn't happen on or near Halloween, unlike the whole troll situation I also agree that this Draco is the best one, the new one looks too much like a Draco from the oldr films, when he smirked a lot more, but, since very character got a redesign...They had to "tune him up" even if it meant changigng him for the worse

Rather similar to LEGO horses. Well designed. Mr Spielbrick, thanks for pointing out some important highlights for the review. I have overlooked it earlier. I strongly agreed with you, that this Draco is the best TLC made. I pretty like the face compared to others. Furthermore, I used my multiple Dracos, for my castle armor guards instead. One could not have too many Dracos. Buckbeak design is well made. The head can be moved upwards and downwards. The mechanism is similar to the horse design. In addition, Buckbeak wings can be removed. Similar to the typical green or black dragon wings that we used to see in the past. Well, the main reason for me to buy this set was in fact Buckbeak. You don't often find a griffin lying around except in Harry Potter sets. Mr Spielbrick, on Jun 12 2008, 12:28 AM, said: The orange brick doesn't have a pumpkin face on it, right? Unlike the one from Philosopher's Stone in the set with the troll. Sorry to said, there is no print on that pumpkin face. It's pure orange.

I bought about 5 or 6 of these sets when they were on sale in mid- 2006. I still have a few of them laying around unopened. I think I payed like under $5 for each and thats a great deal for all the variety of neat parts you get with this set.

nice review. I like the treemaking pieces the most of this not very expensive set. The Buckbeak fig is very nice and can bow his head like the horses. I was annoyed to get another Draco without some other not made figs (Pansy Parkinson for example). About the dark bley feathers; In the second version of Hogwarts there were several of these feathers put in little 1x1 cones like it was a feather to write with it. I bought 2 sets of these and when they were for sale I just bought +/- 6 more of it. Only annoying that I had then even a bigger army of Draco's.

Hello EB! Yes, I'm cranking out the reviews! The other day I picked up this gem for an okay sales price at Devonport, Tas, while searching for the new Batsets. I informed iamded of this as he is a Spidey-suckup ( ) and he informed me this was the only set he didn't have of the Wave 2 of this theme. So I ask you great EB members to please remind him of this when commenting! Here we go with the review of Doctopus' lair: Anyway, unlike other reviews, this stars more people, the Batbrick-iamded-dragonator-Daisy review! (Daisy is the mouse that came in the set) First up re the figs, and I must say they are great. I love fleshies and these are excellent to expand my Batman world, plus having a Spiderman to beat up is good too Doctopus is great, though his tentacles are annoying to keep in order. Peter Parker is a nice addition, I love that torso. Eve though Harry Osborn was totally absent from this scene, I welcome him as he is a good fig also. Best of all is Mary Jane, fleshie females are hard to come by and I love that hair, my very first one! Oh, and even better is bley Daisy on the far right: Another fantastic thing is that by mixing MJ with Doctopus you get a far more deadly and real villain than anyone could've forseen - The Hippy! Oh c'mon, tell me that ain't cool? Anyhoo, here is a pic of Doctopus showing his might: Random fact: Did you know I influence both dragonator and iamded in their sigfigs? dragonator adapts his from my IA series while iamded added Mutt hair when I had him like that in a pic I posted. Now onto the box, sorry about the lighting. The art is good and the cartoon spidey in the corner may have beenthe inspiration for a similar style in the new Batsets: Back of the box. Again, sorry about the lighting and blur, it was gtting late and these were the last pics: Finally we get to the first part of the set: The catapult. Is that movie accurate or what? I love the part in SM2 when he uses his homemade genetic spider powered catapult to launch himself to the scene! Oh well, it does comes with a cool spider web an trans blue spider, so it gets some points: And it is really fun! I launched spidey several metres once, I don't think he ever recovered. Infact, he almost certainly webbed himself Slightly cooler extras are these two. This awesome little boat is great for city, as is the simple but nice bouy, Daisy approves: Naturally dragonator ruins everything when he found out the "dragon" that would be riding with him was our nickname for Daisy Now finally, the main attraction - Coctopus' Dock. iamded and I threw dragonator in the water to see if he could swim. He er, couldn't One Sweeney todd later, we continue! The overall construction of the building is very good. I know a lot of people hated stickers and i hated applying these, but they do look spectacular and perfect for any City setting, like a bank, a Gotham Bank As iamded has already noted below me the black lifesavers a very cool as are the web piece and log pieces: The inside contains the neutron copperplate triple bypass humdrum holy hum 5000, which does does, see movie. Anyhoo, it is very cool, and includes a little control thingy on the yellow brick next to it. Unfortunately, the inside is plain but for that: The other side has no wall too which is a bit of a letdown really, but atleast it allows Daisy easy access. one gripe is those yellow 1x1 bricks, they serve no purpose and break up the colour scheme: Better shot of the thingy thing. I quite like it, the use of technic parts actually works, and the whole set is worth it for those purple flames and dishes alone It closes up pretty well too, unable to hit the dish which is a nice feature: Me and iamded liked it so much we threw a revived dragonator into it. Unfortunately it disagreed with him, but it was fun: Another shot of the dock. I like how they have gaps in the jetty, I know the movie version was pretty wack, and although the set isn't very faithful to it (looks more like a seaside library to be frank) it still is very nice. This is my first large blue baseplate too which is wonderful, though funny how the set only uses about half of it: The roof is a well designed and fun feature, it uses some technic connections to render it flexible of any degree, as you can see here by my opening of it: Better shot of the roof design, it can lie flat or at any angle. I might use the design myself in the future: As much as I love the building this feature bugs me, for in order for it to work this wall has to stick out, which not only looks ugly but makes you be able to see through the corners. Still, easily modded, and log pieces are fantastic for mocing. It also means that there are 7 windows all up for a good, sizeable building: By pulling out the piece in the center the walls both collapss sideways outwards, which is actually pretty fun and works everytime: Overall view of the set including characters: Now for the story that makes no sense....at all: Spiderman is dead after falling down the wall mechanism (see above): Only Daisy can save the day! For dragonator is being held by the evil Doctopus! And iamded and dragonator are too busy not caring! And Brainbox is too busy complaining that this goes against all Marvel continuity! Unfortunately Daisy is on a lunchbreak so tough luck dragonator: And Daisy goes on a search for fortune and glory: Okay, this is what I think of the set: Build: 3/5 - Fun, but those stickers ruin the experience somewhat, and if you don't apply them the instructions are a bit hard to follow. Playability: 4/5 - Great little gizmos and bits, not the kind that keep you going like with the 2007 Aquabase, but good fun still. Design: 4/5 - Not very movie faithful no, but still a great little building and a smart design for certain aspects. Minifigs: 5/5 - Great figs with all different faces and very useful bits. Price: 2/5 Far, FAR overpriced even on sale sadly Total: 18/25 - A good set that could've been better with a few minor changes. Nothing wrong with it, but it doesn't really cross the line to greatness. That said, it has a lot going for it and definitely worth buying or atleast a look! Thanks for reading Batbrick Away!

Lookin' good so far! Though I must say it's Doc Ock, not Dok Ock... The catapult is, well, ridiculous, but the boat is very spiffy, and the buoy is a nice addition! I actually like the stickers on the window pieces, perfect for this building, and great for post-Apoc scenes. Black life-saver rings are a nice addition too.Anyway, hurry up dragonator and Batbrick!

Plenty of cool pieces, and the baseplate has found a use in the Batcave. Although I think my dad managed to spill some beer on it at one point. That was awful to clean off...

Great review Batbrick, I was curious as to what the interior of the building looked like, I still think that there should have been a few random chains or something lying around as they may add to the abandoned feeling that the ware house had. Though I have to admit that I really like the roof dock and minifigs as some of them make good average civilians that are somewhat hard to come by in todays sets . Great comic as well it seemed to add a lot to your review, hope you can review another Spider man set soon . BTW as Adam mentioned I believe you owe me a bar of soap, for reading your review ...

Hi Everyone, Please note that this review was done back in 2006, so do forgive me if you happened to notice any dated comments. Product: 6205 V-wing Theme: Star Wars No of pieces: 118 Release Date: Feburary 2006 RRP: SGD29.90/USD9.90 Availability: Lego Shop@Home, Target, Toys 'R' Us (US & Europe), Bricksworld (SG). Lego.com said: Rule the spaceways! The sleek V-wing fighter can adapt to any situation! Position the wings and flaps in attack mode to protect Palpatine's shuttle from enemies. Or position the wings in flight mode to survey the area for intruders! Either way, the V-wing is ready to strike for the Republic. Includes Clone pilot and R4 droid. Position wings in attack or flight mode! Sorry to all for the delay, since this was supposed to be done 3 days ago. Anyway, to get on with it... Quite a minimal amount of baggies for this set, as noticed. And the best thing is... no sticker sheet. Yippee!! :bounce: The completed v-wing. Though not really a complaint, it would be nice if the entire astromech body was provided instead of only the head dome. :p Of course, then it wouldn't be movie-accurate, since the Q7 series astro-mech is integrated with the starfighter. :lol: He's definitely well-painted for a simple mini-fig. Since even the back is painted too. I have to assumed this is the same mini-fig provided for 7259 ARC-170 Starfighter too, since I don't have that set. Anyway, this mini-fig is much more accurate for this v-wing since his suit is rated against vacuum, while those in the arc-170 aren't . :p One thing that's lacking is the instruments panel in the cockpit... it's totally non-existent here. I wonder what went wrong during the design stage. Personally... this is the second most anticipated set for 2006, the first being the tie interceptor, for me. One thing is that there's no known release of the V-wing starfighter by hasbro, nor the other well-known brands. The other thing is that being a star wars vehicle collector, I would really loved to see a replica toy of the V-wing. And the V-wing by the Lego Group does not disappoint... it's nearly movie-accurate, except for the cockpit transparisteel cover which could used some paint like the x-wing's. Also, there's a permanent landing gear that quite neat, since it allows you to land the craft on uniform surfaces. The s-foils on the other hand can be quite a pain to pose into flight position. Very difficult for the s-foils to remain symmetrical during play. The "swoosh-able" or play factor of this product is quite good... just check out the pics for yourself... :D *Crackle* General Skywalker, we have incoming! To conclude, the v-wing starfighter would make a much better companion to the Eta-2 Actis Interceptor (Jedi Starfighter), than the arc-170. Coz the arc-170 seems more like a long-range bomber to me, than a snub-fighter. :p And a final pic to show it at rest... Comments (For 2008) Just an updated pic to show my latest display on the clone wars Hmm... off the record, I do understand that sometimes, reviews by most tend to a certain set of guidelines like naming the set, and showing the boxed, and out of boxed pics, and of course, the grading portion. Regarding my review, I prefer not to grade any of the lego sets at all as far as possible, because to each, his/her own. My reasons to put up a review is not to belittle the efforts of TLG in coming out with these products nor to help them market them, but to show my appreciation and enjoyment of these products. I hope noone is offended by this, and would like to apologise for any misunderstanding that this may caused. For those who do not understand the above paragraph, care not for it and Play On! Like Me

Thanks for the detailed review valentin it had good picture quality and a nice little comic near the end. Although this is a slightly older set it still was a good one, I remmeber that I bought two of them to build up a small airforce for the Republic, and if I see another one I may buy it for use in the Starwars Comic game. Keep up the good work .

It's from the container that can hold 100 CD-Rs. Hi WhiteFang, can't deny that they were once my fav. hunts for lego, and yes, that price tag is a tad hard to remove. Well, while am delighted at the V-wing, I still kinda wish it had come with a printed brick for its instruments panel.

Nice review, but I have to correct something for you: valentin, on Jun 15 2008, 09:53 AM, said: One thing is that there's no known release of the V-wing starfighter by hasbro, nor the other well-known brands. The other thing is that being a star wars vehicle collector, I would really loved to see a replica toy of the V-wing. This quote is wrong - here's a link to the Hasbro V-Wing photo archive over on Rebelscum.com

Here's the 3rd of the whole batch of complete reviews done back in 2006. Hope you guys enjoy them so far. Product: 6206 Tie Interceptor Theme: Star Wars No of pieces: 212 Release Date: February 2006 RRP: SGD39.90/USD19.90 Availability: Lego Shop@Home, Target, Toys 'R' Us (US & Europe), Bricksworld (SG). Lego.com said: Challenge the Rebels! Blasting out of Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi, the TIE Interceptor is the fastest fighter in the Imperial fleet! Open the cockpit canopy and fold down the instrument panel to put the TIE pilot inside and recreate your favorite classic Star Wars battles! Includes TIE fighter pilot! Cockpit opens and instrument panel folds down! It does seem to have more pieces than the average tie fighter, but this is actually cheaper than the 7263 TIE Fighter. Of course, there's no light-up feature in this set. :sweat: YesH!! Finally... A... Tie Interceptor!! This is probably the most anticipated for all set for all lego tie collectors worldwide, since the fighter, bomber, advanced, and even the Expanded Universe droid fighter had been released by the Lego Group. This set is near movie-accurate, since the bottom part of it ain't. :p The cockpit and pylons uses the same design as that of the tie advanced piloted by Darth Vader. Except for one minor change, that is the aft interior of the cockpit is strengthen this time. And this is indeed good news, since the older models had a problem of hard hinge and loose brick connection. There's no landing gear for this set, but it doesn't require it anyway. This tie interceptor balances perfectly on its wings. Standard instruments panel and, of course, standard imperial pilot. The "swoosh-able" or play factor of this set is definitely very high... Just take a look. :D *Camera view from own craft* *Camera view from Tie-Advanced* *Combat simulation of Endor's Battle from the archives* No bomber, since I started late in re-collecting. :p To conclude, for a typical lego fan, this set is a 60/40, 60 due to it's good design, and for a typical star wars fan, this is a must-get. The only flaw for this set is the same flaw for any lego set in SG, the price. :doh: Comment(Current in 2008) Being a starwars fan... no... being a typical toy collector, space is definitely a premium... so much so that I turned to lego starwars to sate my appetite for more starwars products when I already have no more display space. For the next few non-lego pictures, they are the crown of my starfighter collection in 1/18 scale. So just view them for fun, eh? And no, I haven't had the chance nor the time to do up a scene of my lego starfighters blowing up spectacularly since the pieces would be very hard to put back... Hmm... then again, isn't that what lego is about. "doH".

I picked up this set mainly because of the many (5+spare) glow in the dark parts and the promise of 2 racers and one helicopter for the price of a little more than two racers (90kr. vs. 2x40kr.) The box The back of the box shows the two alternate models you can build if the polybags rip. There are 3 cheese slopes and two 1x2 tiles that glow in the dark, where the tiles are exclusive for this set. The total parts count is high at 142, but there are no really big pieces among them. Inside the box you will find the building instructions, a sheet with some odd sticky labels (thrown away) and 3 polybags marked by the bag building difficulty. The models The lime colored car doesn't bring out anything new. We have seen racers built like that before, but it does contain some nice bricks for the collection. The police cruiser surprises with an interesting design along the sides as seen here. It is harder to build because of the greater level of details: The helicopter is without doubt the hardest vehicle to build in a bag. I can't finish it because it's larger than the bag. You can't put on the top blades nor the tail of the thing, so it beats the forklift from 7733 where the top bar is the new kind that doesn't completely fit. There is also instructions for the alternate models, but it requires the bags to be opened... The vehicles are pretty standard for the racers theme with the police car being the highlight of the set Conclusion I like the difficulty curve between bag 1 and 2, but the last bag should be labeled 1000000 instead of 3. It requires some inhuman skills to build that helicopter in the bag... ? Lime colored car: 3 - We have seen it before, but it has some nice pieces... and lime. Police Cruiser: 9 - It has a massive diffusers, rare parts and a high level of details. It is a shame LEGO relies so much on stickers. Helicopter: 6 - if you see it as a set for one fourth of the price of the cars, it is quite amazing, but you can't bag build it and I would personally prefer some more detail instead of the big size. Overall it is a nice little set, but the police car is the main attraction. I wouldn't get the other vehicles if they were sold separately.

Open the bags? If they were meant to be opened, why did LEGO close them in the first place? Bag building is not for everybody. Some might become very frustrated with it and let their anger out on the set by lining it up on a mini golf course.

Seeming as there were no reviews of this set in the index I have uploaded mine from Jabbas Hutt . Here is my review for LEGO set 10178 Motorized walking AT-AT Because I live in the UK I got this set with 6 free duracell batteries which was great! (It's just twice as expensive as the US) Heres the basic set that is from the instructions. This is the cockpit but please note after I took this photo I realised it was slightly built wrong. Heres one of the feet in proportion to a minifig to give you a general size. This is Luke Skywalker swinging on a wire trying to destroy the AT-AT I really wish LEGO didn't make so many Luke's because I want differnt minifigs. It would also be nice for a thermal detonator piece. Underneath the AT-AT you can see the shaft that moves the back legs, the motor and squeezed in on the righ t the massive battery box. A load of cogs that move the legs. These are the included figures Snowtrooper, General Maximilian Veers, AT-AT Driver/Pilot or whatever you want to call him and Luke all whithout there wepons. please note Veers should have a dark stone snowtroooper torso with 4 red and blue badge things not 3. These are the figures with weapons I gave them and the included ones Snowtrooper has new style blaster, Veers has Standard light grey pistol like the ones from the old adventure sets, AT-AT driver has old style blaster which I call heavy Blaster and Luke has SHINY HANDLE blue Light Sabre . The Shiny blue light sabre was included with the set which is a bonus because i really dont like the grey ones. http://www.brickshel...sc00521.jpg.jpg This is the switch which is attached to the battery box on either side of the AT-AT underneath the lift up side panels. you push the forward to walk forward and backward to walk backwards simple eh . A front veiw with the the panels open. Here are the Drivers controls which are simply a cotrol panel and 2 exo-force robot hands which are joystick things seen in the film if you look closley. The almost useless carry handle. This is the weird back piece. Looking down the AT-AT from the back where you can see the the battery box and switch. Troops decending from ropes and cables and Vader leading the assult for this I hadnt got any more imp's so I used Clones Pilots. (I now have a whole load more snowtroopers) Solo and Chewie sabotaging. More troops to squash rebel scum huzahh! A very bad picture of everyone packed up inside. The size incomparison to its predecessor Overall I would give this set 9/10 because it should come with more snowtroopers or it could be and Endor version with loads of strormies and scout troopers. Aswell as this you can really sit any one down because of the battery box but I stilll find space to put all the shown figures on this review in the interior as you can see on the above image the chains and ropes are hanging down a bit. Tjis set is now limited to 5 per customer in the UK and now no longer comes with free batteries. The walking on this is a bit wonky and dosen't really walk like they do in the film as it moves two legs at a time. I am currently attaching a motor to the head to make it move independently.

Great review Indexing it, as I write this. How come You think the CTT is the AT-ATs predecessor? Do you mean the motorized AT-AT or AT-AT's in general? I think this is a great set and I am very fond of mine. It's one of the few SW sets of mine that is on "parade" at all times. Most are packed away in the attic.

At least the figs are great. A chrome lightsabe hilt for luke, ecxellent. and the pilot is cool too, and another snowie doesnt hurt. and i didnt even know about the commander guy (whatever you call him), so people could have made a custom DS this whole time?! thanks again!

10143 Death Star II Production year: 2005 Pieces: 3441 Minifigs: 0 Price: 299 USD peeron.com 10143 Gallery The Review Ph4tDuD3:"DS review!!!?!!! - u 2 kewl 2 do diz" Me:"Yes" Ph4tDuD3:"Kewl..do u have pix of the minifigs?" Me:"Erhm..what minifigs?" Ph4tDuD3:"The ph4t figs from the DS!!1" Me:"This is the other Death Star" Ph4tDuD3:"OMFG there's more than 1" Me:"Yes" Ph4tDuD3:"keeeeewl. must have!!" Me:"Goodbye" [pushes the incinerator button] Ph4tDuD3:"wut?! nooooooooooooooooooo..........." and on that note, let's start the reivew of the UCS DEATH STAR II. Now this is an older set (2005) and I've only gotten around to buying it a short while ago. It took me around 2 evenings to build it and I must say that I am fairly impressed by this set. Time for a box pic: The Build: Since I started building this huge (small moon size) set at Morten's appartment, I wanted to keep as few polybags open at any given time as possible. With this set it is actually possible to have a minimum of bricks scattered over a table or two while building. Not sure why, but the division of bricks in the different polybags just work very well. And that is great with a set this size - 3441 bricks. The building of the set is divided into several "Build this times x". For example the upper and lower part of the "unshielded" DS are completely alike. This is difficult to see when looking at the model, but heaven when building it: And this is how they solved the problem of having the wings connected to the buttom of the Death Star - geniously done IMO: Note that in the first pic the "skeleton" is easily seen. "The skeleton" holds the X to which both the upper and lower part is "clicked" on with technic pins. Also there's a steering wheel (I'm sure there's a pirate name for that ) like the one in the bottom, in the top of the model to hold the upside "wings". So after having build duplicate wings (upper and lower), the "belt" (all the way around the star) and the upper and lower part of the "unshielded" side, it was time to step back and watch the Death Star II in all it's glory: Such a great UCS set. Now I did have a few "huh's" during the build: HUH! #1 In the instruction the technic lesser-dragon-head should be dark grey, but I got it in light gray. Go figure and thank you replacement parts. I've experienced this before and apparently TLG uses different colours when "out-of-stock". All one has to do is call them and ask for the right colour and it's on it's way Still a HUH! experience. HUH! #2 Again it appears that TLG changed the design of the technic axleholed 1x2 bricks. The bottom has changed and I got the set where it was mixed up between "old" and "new" version. Not that annoying, but still got me perplexed as to: "Am I doing this right?" Kinda stressing to consider taking most of the star apart to check the remaining 231 technic bricks 1x2 with axlehole. Now for a verdict: : 1: looks great 2: even my "wife" likes it - female appeal 3: it's a great build 4: the polybags work for you 5: it's Star Wars 6: the design is awesome : 1: it wobbles if you touch it 2: very small parts come off, if you touch it 3: parts come off when you try to move it somewhere safe 4: zero swooshability So in short (yes even shorter]: The DSII is a well designed UCS set that has a great design. Like most other UCS sets, it is not meant for play - hence don't play with it. UCS verdict (the numbers) 5/10 (design++/instructions+-/bricks+-/sturdiness--/colourscheme+-) design: awesome look and great greeble set instructions: easy to follow steps with bricks mentioned hard to see wether it's black or dark grey bricks: loads of great bricks a zillion bricks of the same type sturdiness: DON'T TOUCH colouscheme: grey in grey with a little touch of black Need a missing instruction?

Thanks for the review KimT - it comes at a... confusing time You can take off the top disk and lift it like the Millennium Falcon from the top Now. I actually don't like this set that much. It takes about 5 hours and 15 minutes to build if you do it in one go, but the repeating sections makes this built the most tedious I have experienced. It has way too many holes from which you can see the colorful skeleton and is overpriced compared to the older 10030 ISD. I remember thinking it was too expensive when it was 50% off at S@H! Even the Snowspeeder was "kewler" to less than half the price:

Hmmm, ive still got this set and i must say, i think you did a good job of reviewing it. But... Overall, i hate the set, probably the worst UCS set so far (apart from the naboo fighter but that hardly even counts as UCS) from my experience. Unless you really really want it and have nothing better to spent your $$$ on, in that case go for it. But in my case, it was a very repetitive build and final model was quite... well, bland, not must variety to it, if you know what i mean.for the price, i would really reccomend the UCS star destroyer, because thats a much better story..

Thanks for the review. Eh, honestly, I though this was awful ever since I first saw the pictures. To me, an incomplete grey ball doesn't really work as a special UCS kit, for the sole reason that it's BORING. Extremely so. Now, the new Death Star playset is a whole different story. They should have done that in the first place. Edited by Grevious, 24 June 2008 - 09:12 PM.

even though i never liked UCS, i absolutley hate this one. Sure, its great on display, but the build looks extremley boring to me, just stacking plate after plate. And as you said, its going to break a little if you touch it. The only intersting part for me is the firing laser. Although i do have to say the proce isnt too bad, i still wouldt buy it. And no minifigs so thanks for the review, but ill pass on this one. The new minifig scale DS looks awesome though, and this might have hyped some up who are buying the new DS,

Though there is 4 "spots" where it can be attached to the DS. Reading your comments on this set, I can see why TLG has been forced to put it on sale on the US S@H. I don't agree that the ISD is better - IMHO they're exactly them same - big and grey This is a question of personal liking - which is the coolest DS or ISD. Not comparative. I'd still call this an ok UCS when looking at it individually, but there sure is a lot other UCS sets that would get a better score than 5/10. KimT

I think it's a very weird and boring UCS set, but... What a lot of grey plates! You could build something much better out of them, but it would be fairly flat. It looks very fragile though , my UCS AT-ST is... Edited by Shoc, 25 June 2008 - 10:28 AM.

Thanks for the review KimT! Honestly, like the others have said, I don't find any appeal in UCS sets, especially this one. It's just a big, incomplete, grey ball.

The build was a bit boring and I suppose a big grey ball isn't all that interesting, but since the Death Star II in the movie is a big grey ball too, I don't see the problem. I didn't think it was particularly fragile. I don't care about minifigs or playability either. A few plusses: in my opinion it looked pretty damn impressive sitting in my LEGO room and the construction is really clever. All in all, I actually liked this one, but perhaps I have a different expectation of sets than most of you. Sets are mainly parts packs and would you look at the quantity of grey plate in this thing! (It's new grey BTW). I paid half price for it at shop@home UK, which is still a _lot_ more than half price from the US, and I didn't regret it for a second. Cheers, Ralph

Not comparative. Here are some advantages that makes ISD win for me: - A lot more fun to build with less repetitions - It is easier to build alternate models from it! (How many alternate models of the DS2 have you seen?) - The bricks are more varied. - You get magnets! - It is a larger set if you look at the size

Wow, what a letdown. I recently picked up this set, and I looked up this review to see what I was getting into. Not good news. The silver lining is that it was a "Damaged box" deal at Brickworld, so it only cost me $100 (half off the already lowered price) so it was definatley worth it as a parts pack, if nothing else. It's the last unopened/unbuilt "large" kit in my collection, so even if it is repetetive, I am going to build it anyway. It is likely however that I may substitute pieces to do away with the colored interior. I've already determined that after it sits on display for a while, I want to do a Zepplin as an alternate build. Looking at the parts list it looks like its the perfect set for such an undertaking.

Dang! So much negativity on a such spectacular set! This baby provides an amazing backdrop to any Lego inspired Star Wars diorama. And lets face it Lego tends to be a rectangular brick and somehow we now have a sphere!!! Guys... its a UCS. It accurately depicts the on screen icon and put plain and simple is a wonderful sculptural piece of work in its own right. I agree with KimT in that the removal of the laser and Super Star Destroyer gives it more authenticity but to call it a gray golf ball or ignore its inherent accuracy is simply to miss the point. It proved to be the best build to share with someone, be it family or friend due, to its repeated sections and impressive finish. Its a clever build and to criticize it for lack of playability or (I suspect for many) its absence of minifigs is just absurd and possibly why Lego has not released a proper UCS in nearly two years. I reckon many out there would love a UCS Tyderium, Imperial Walker or Slave 1 with a spectacular piece count be it minifig scale or just darn impressive in its own right. Sadly for those who love these sculptural masterpieces we're stuck with simple toys with 'play features' and cute minifigs. Clever in their own right but lacking the clout and purity of the old UCS line. Let's hope some diversity of product is just around the corner else 10179 was the last of the truly brave financial gambles of the Star Wars line....

7656 General Greivous's Starfighter Release: 2007 Number of Pieces: 232 Minifigs: 1 Brickset Welcome! This is my first review, so contstructive critisism is very much appreciated! On to the review: First, we start out with the box: The box art is the same as always since 2006. nothing special. Then we start the build. The build is fairly easy, and will take the seasoned builder about 15-20 min to complete. Here is the finished model: and bird's eye view: As you can see, this ship is very sleek. The fins or "wings" each have an outer slope and an inner one, with the guns in between. There are also cones on the front of the fins, which give the ship an even more sleek look. In the middle of the wings there is the main body, with a big slope and stripes decorating it. This set has a very good playability factor, as I'm about to show you now. The guns on the ship are pretty cool looking to begin with; a bley slope attaching a lightsaber hilt and a trans-neon green stud to the fin on each side. But theres more than what meets the eye: Yes, the guns flip up! ...and they can flip all the way back to hide them, for whatever case they need hiding. Lets have a look at the back, there is a tail fin used as landing gear and some lightspeed boosters: But wait... The tail fin can flip up for flight thanks to a hinge attached to the back of the cockpit. Heres another playability factor: The cockpit can slide open very smoothly and easily. Heres how this is possible: A clever system under the hood allows the cockpit to open. See those two bley pieces on the black ones? Those bley ones attach to the tan plates under the hood, and the hood and windsheild attach to the black peices. The black and bley pieces work together as a sliding system, so the cockpit opens. Viola! And then the cockpit snaps in place thanks to the red hook and clip. Its a very accurate system, and works very well. You'll want to open and close it over and over again! Now, finnaly to the fig: The General himself. A very impressive fig, with a new head and torso mold. In this set, (which is one of only two with Greivous in it) he comes with 2 green and two blue lightsabers, all with bley hilts ( ). I was hoping for chrome hilts, but its a minor fault. Grievous also comes with a new mold pistol blaster (not pictured). Heres the General in the cockpit (sadly a weak cockpit, no details): He just half lays down on a small slope. In this set, he doesnt come with a cape beacuse with it on, the cockpit doesnt close. Thats about it, heres the... FINAL VERDICT: Build: 7/10 Fairly easy but fun. A little bit weak. Playability: 8/10 Many playability factors, but some are boring or pointless. Swooshability: 8/10 very fun to fly around, sometimes pieces break off. Minifigs: 10/10 one amazing fig with 4 lightsabers and a new blaster. what more could you ask for? Design: 9/10 very sleek, but hardly any real texture. i like it, but others might want greebling. Price: 10/10 Overall Score: 9/10 A very cool ship with a very cool minifig and accessories. One of the best SW sets I have ever seen for its small price I highly recommend it to any kind of SW, LEGO, or SW LEGO fan. Hope you enjoyed my review, please leave feedback!

But if you hold it in your palm or from the sides, it wont break. Emphasis on sometimes. But dont try to mess around with it by removing its pieces or adding new one, or modding it in any way, because the sliding mechanism wont agree with the mods and break. But this hardly takes away from anyone liking this set because, IMO, its perfect just how it is.

You guys know that you can use the new robot/skeleton arms from the Castle sets to make him hold his lightsabers horizontically, right? I always have him with two of each kind of arm.

Hello all Eurobricks members, I will be doing the second wave of the 2008 Impulse set series, which had released recently. I bought this set earlier ago, and will like to share this comprehensive review with everyone of you. Name: Troll Warrior Theme: LEGO System / Castle Year: 2008 Pieces: 19 Minifigs: 1 An image of a 5618, Troll Warrior Let the march begin The mighty brave troll warrior, carrying a dangerous cart equipped with a "flick" fire missile. Marching into the lands of the Crown Kingdom. Crown Knights must be ready for this new troll addition. From what I see, this set has a very minimum piece count since it's an impulse set. There is no unique parts found in this set. However, this set has a couple of useful accessories, such as 2 spears and 2 wooden wheels and a grey mouse running around. This set is another alternative for Castle Army builders to buy multiple sets, to build a massive Troll armies. In addition, the flick missile really works. Use a little bit of force from your finger and flick it, the missile will fly. Well, it certainly does not impress me at all with such playing feature. Base of the cart Different angles There is one thing I dislike about this set. The wooden wheels are too big, and it is the same as the ones in the Crossbow attack. I prefer the smaller wheels that exist in old castle sets that produced smaller cart. Since this cart size is similar to the old cart size. The old wizard's cart is a very good example of the proposed wheel. Bits and Pieces Close-up on the warrior and the mouse Summary review Playability: 5.5/10 (The playability feature is not fanastic.) Design: 6.5/10 (Design is adequate. If the wheels is much smaller and the flicking thing disappear, the score will be much higher) Price: 8/10 (An inexpensive set to get a troll warrior and a mouse.) Overall: 6/10 (To conclude, this set is good only for army builders. A new range of millitary vehicle to be added. That's all) Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. Comments and Critics are strongly welcomed. Pictures can be found in My Brickshelf (When moderated) Edited by KimT, 10 August 2008 - 01:29 PM.

Thanks for the review. Bearing in mind that the whole point of this set is to get a cheap troll warrior, I actually quite like it. The cart isn't brilliant, but for 13 pieces it's not that bad. The troll fig is great as always, and I guess the rats are always nice to get (not so much in real life though). The sets that contain the trolls have a fairly solid number each (I mean, Tower Raid has three!), but nevertheless I think I may have to pick up a few of these.

If this impulse set includes a troll shield, my rating will defintely go higher. This is a troll army builder set, with minimum feature and limited weapons range. If the troll comes with an armor or a shield, I will think this set is worth it. Troll armor is hard to get by, as it appeared only in Troll Warship and Tower Raid.

Guys, thanks for your kind comments. It seemed most of us here love this impulse set, mainly to build army. Guess, I am a little bit too critic in my review. I was expecting a little bit more! Nevertheless, I intend to buy multiple sets of this and build on my orc armies and split them into different battalions. This is indeed one of the better ways to acquire orcs.

Give the new theme a chance. I feel TLG have made an effort to revive certain elements that are present in past castle themes. Although it is not as good as the past, but it is certainly better than the recent castle themes. Shoc, on Jul 4 2008, 01:00 AM, said: Why is mouse friendlier than rat? Well, mouse sounded more friendly, because it can associate with Tom and Jerry. But, calling it a rat equal calling it a pest.. It's just a matter of putting it in different terms. That's all. Edit: Instead of posting another post to explain why I used mouse. I will write it here. Tom and Jerry is reflected as a cartoon. Children associate Jerry as a mouse, since its supposed to be heart-warming and make us laugh. In real life, there are many different pets we raised. One of the possible pets we considered is a mouse. Mouse are supposed to be shy and friendly creatures that live in harmony. While rats lived in packs, hunt food in the dark and is widely regarded as a "pest". In this review, I am trying to illustrate rat and associate it with mouse by presenting it in a much friendly approach. There is no right or wrong answer. It's just making use of different words to represent how I feel towards a particular thing. Edited by WhiteFang, 04 July 2008 - 08:08 AM.

This is a nice way of building up orc armies, but I do wish it was designed like the Knight impulse set. There you have a minifig, enough weapons and armor for two figs and a weapons rack made out of basic pieces. Add a generic fig from your collection and you have two knights and the pieces from the rack can be easily used in MOCs. The pieces that make up the siege weapon in the Orc impulse are not as easy to use in other creations. I'd rather have seen a "Orcish" weapons rack (different from the Knights rack, but like it, using basic elements) with a second helmet, another weapon, the Orc armor and a shield to put on it. Still, although not as good as the Knight impulse, it's a nice little set. WhiteFang, on Jul 4 2008, 03:43 AM, said: Tom and Jerry is reflected as a cartoon.

While rats lived in packs, hunt food in the dark and is widely regarded as a "pest". Where I come from people keep both as pets. However, if either are found in the house uninvited, they are considered pests. And if you look at the Chinese zodiac, rats are very well thought of and are symbols of prosperity. The Brick Mouse Rat

Thank you for the review. The set is nice, I didn't need the flickfire missiles and would have rather a orc/trol shield instead, but I think I will pick one up.

Hello all Eurobricks members, I will be doing a continuation of my Impulse set reviews. I was pretty excited when I laid my hands on these new impulse sets yesterday. Hope to give most of you a good insight for this set. Name: Street Cleaner Theme: LEGO System / Town / City Year: 2008 Pieces: 22 Minifigs: 1 An image of a 5620, Street Cleaner Let the cleaning begin The Street Cleaner has a job to do. It is to clean the rubbish on the streets, after a New Year Countdown. It seemed the cleaning agency have a new equipment to use. It's not as big as the previous street sweeper machine. The cleaner will need to operate the equipment manually, by pushing it. Look at the mess After sorting out Look at the pieces offered. It's not a very complicated set, since it's an impulse set. There are some pretty useful parts lying around such as the broom, spade. However, I was quite surprised when I could not find the lid of the rubbish bin. I can't used this rubbish bin to place it around my town, without a lid on top of it. I believed it is not a norm, by not including the lid. Look at that bin Well, that rubbish bin seem to be containing his equipment in it, instead of the rubbish. The cleaner's face looks pretty sad. I think he wants to have a change of job. Front View I love that blue brush very much. Quite fun to play with, especially pushing the rubbish aside. That's why a spade is there to help him to dig out the litter and the broom to brush it away. Ok, now I know why his face looks so sad! Where is that Street Sweeper machine? Summary review Playability: 6.5/10 (Not bad to play with) Design: 7.5/10 (The design is relatively interesting, with the use of the technic part, to be its foundation.) Price: 8/10 (An inexpensive set to get another cleaner and some neat accessories.) Overall: 7/10 (Not a bad set after all. Pretty average, but still quite good to buy if your towns required more cleaners.) Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. Comments and Critics are strongly welcomed.

Thanks for the review . Not a bad price (of course, its impulse) for a fig, a little cleaner thing, and two accesories. The brush, fig, and spade i dont have yet, so i might just pick this up.

Looking at this is making me want to build one of the favourite sets of my childhood, 6649 Street Sweeper (might do that today actually). Cheap. good pieces (despite the lack of a bin lid... that's just inviting disaster isn't it?), nice fig, and one of those blue brushes, which I've always loved but never managed to use. Thanks WhiteFang.

Thanks for the review! Poor little minifig: This guy has to haul the heavy machine all the way from the depot onto the littered streets to locate some trash, but when he has finally found some and switches on the machine everything will be launched towards his pants.... No wonder he's looking sad.... A nice set though, and inventive too! When it comes to streetsweepers, I remember getting the first of it's kind on my birthday in 1991.

Hello all Eurobricks members, I will be doing a continuation of my Impulse set reviews. This will be the third review at a go. Hope everyone of you will find this review useful in a way. Name: Coast Guard Kayak Theme: LEGO System / Town / City Year: 2008 Pieces: 21 Minifigs: 1 An image of a 5621, Coast Guard Kayak Roll Roll, Roll your boat It seemed the coast guard has a kayak of his own, roaming in the sea, making sure that swimmers will be safe in the beach. Now, I am illustrating him as a life guard instead. This set is simply wonderful. Among the 4 new impulse sets, Coast Guard Kayak is the best looking set in my opnion. The kayak design is very simple but looks realistic . Furthermore, if you don't need it to be a coast guard kind of stuff. Use it as a leisure water spot instead down in the marina. I will think any LEGO citizen will love to have some water spot in their busy life. So come down here and wind down with this new sport. Bits and Pieces Kayak and the bouy The bouy is very useful to position it at the coast of your water to highlight the boundaries in the sea, and warning incoming ships or vessels. Oh, I did not make it tilted purposely. There is a white round base which allow it to tilt on both ends. Useful parts These parts are useful to add on in your city. Somehow, when I see that red cone, I can use it as a police stop, to inspect vehicles on the road or form a barricade with it. The bouy base shape is unique too. I like it very much. It is great to attached it by the side of the boat as a life bouy. The coast guard's life vest and helmet are very useful for water activites. The life vest was produced in past sets, and now it re-surfaced again. I am glad these vests made their way back. A look of him, without the life vest Summary review Playability: 7.5/10 (Fun to play with, especially the bouy when you see it moving up and down.) Design: 8.5/10 (Design is simple but straight to the point, especially the kayak design.) Price: 8/10 (An inexpensive set to get more coast guards and more kayaks.) Overall: 8.5/10 (A very good set to have in your LEGO town. The kayak is simply so lovely to me.) Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine.

Hello all Eurobricks members, This will be my last impulse set review for the second wave. Hope everyone of you will find my reviews useful and helpful in your purchase. Name: Crystal Hawk Theme: LEGO System / Mars Mission Year: 2008 Pieces: 26 Minifigs: 1 An image of a 5619, Crystal Hawk Alpha 3 in Sector 5, reporting to base Alpha 3, Crystal Hawk, reporting for duty, Sir! May I present Mars Mission, latest scout craft, code named "Crystal Hawk". This spacecraft looks very sleek and cool with its usual white and orange color combination. I am not a fan of Mars Mission, but these white mini-figs simply attracted me for it. In fact, I only owned its impulse sets, and none of its main sets. Nevertheless, this set has the "swoosh" factor. I was swooshing around in my home last night. Well, I am not swooshing it like KimT though. Am I seeing double? Haha, the answer is "No". It has double sided face. I combined the pictures, to illustrate the two facial expressions. Bits and Pieces Different angles Love the way how the wings bend upwards and downwards. The only thing I find it a little bit wierd for spacecraft. Normally, I thought joystick is the typical navigation controls for a spacecraft instead of a steering wheel? I am not complaining about a steering wheel in a spacecraft. To me, it's quite an uncommon sight. Anyway, the white steering wheel is an useful part for making vehicles MOCs. Summary review Playability: 8/10 (Fun to play with when you bend the wings up and down.) Design: 8.5/10 (Design is simple, but creates a sleek and cool look.) Price: 8/10 (An inexpensive set to get more scout craft and mars mission mini-figs) Overall: 8.5/10 (A very good set to have for any Mars Mission fans, and for collectors like me whom can't afford all Mars Mission sets, this set is a very great alternative.) Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. Comments and Critics are strongly welcomed. Pictures can be found in My Brickshelf (When moderated)

Thanks for pics. The Hawk, it seems to me, lacks a cockpit, theres not even a seat to keep the pilot from falling off. Perhaps it they'd redesigned it to be a backpack jetpack sort of unit using similar pieces, it'd at least make some sense? Based on the other MM impluses, Can we assume this goes for 3.5$USD? at that price it seems to me, that the Astro Fighter at 5$USD was already a superior impluse set. Guess I'd buy one on clearance, for the minifig.

I am supposed that it comes with a little bit more parts and an additional alien fig with it.

Thanks for another review WhiteFang! This is quite a nice set actually. It evokes some of the design elements of the MX-11, while looking different enough to justify me buying it. The head on the astronaut is one I like, so even better. I hadn't realised it was that one actually. Does 26 pieces make it one of the bigger impulses sets? I think I may have to get one, if not two... Plus it's called 'Crystal Hawk'. How can that not be considered cool?

IMO, Impulse set total piece count should be 30 or less. It will be ideal and more ways to construct a much better impulse sets such as past impulse sets that we came across. I may be wrong, on the 30 piece count thing. But, this is how I view Impulse sets. Brainbox, on Jul 3 2008, 06:11 PM, said: Plus it's called 'Crystal Hawk'. How can that not be considered cool?

Once again, another outstanding review by svelte_corps! I am not a very big fan of Agents, but this theme defintely offer plenty of useful parts. This Volcano Base is simply fanastic for parts usage, especially in doing up landscaping, with mountains, by making use of the brown BURPS. I must admit that the exterior looks real cool, but the interior looks rather empty. These orange slopes certainly make a great illustration of the larva, which gives the Agents a hard time to infiltrate within its compound to save his comrade. I am quite sure, this set will defintely attracts lots of kids to coax their parents to buy it, since the bright colors will defintely caught their attention. With all those hi-tech, sleek weaponary, I am sure this is the next big thing for kids out there. Well, I am not sure if this theme works for me as well. But this set defintely works well for landscaping project.

Sure, the interior might be a bit bare, but I think that the outside of the base with all of the great lava and rocks more than makes up for it. It is a bit weird that on the one side there is nothing on the inside. But that's easy to fix. Anyone know when this will be out in the U.S.? Thanks again for the fantastic review!

Excellent review SC. Thanks for sharing. The figs are awesome. I really like the female villain - an excellent face. I also like the agent uniforms. The laser gun is perfect. It has that Peter Sellers/Pink Panther dooms day device look that I envision when I think of laser destruction. The volcano has some neat features as well, like the trans. red/orange lava. It is a bit heavy on stickers though, as are many new sets/themes. But overall, I think this set will really appeal to the kids. - A great review of a neat set.

I didn't exactly know where this belongs the best but i think it fits the best in here cause it's somewhat space related. I got this nifty little set yesterday from an auction ebay, new and sealed! I think the rock raiders theme was a great theme, and i wish they would have continues id back then. But anyway, let's see what we got here: Set Nr.: 4910 Name: Hover Scout Number of minifigs: 1 Number of pieces: 39 Release Year: 1999 First, a picture of the little box & instructions: A general overview of the set: And here we have the lovely (?) Miss Jet! (yes, the minifigures had odfficial names in this theme ) The little vehicle: And finally the Crystal Analysis Station. i like that very much, even if it's simple, but it does a good job and the amount of equipment also is cool: That's it, little set, little review, but big fun. I can recommend that to everybody, it's great for the parts, and the minifig is lovely. Gets a 10/10 from me

Woo! Rock Raiders! Only the best theme ever! (That's right, possibly even better than Castle `07!) Cheers for the review metalandi, hopefully you can inspire others to see the greatness of Rock Raiders too! I love how everything was so simple, yet so effective. It was loads of fun to play with and build the alternate models when I was younger as well (and probably still is ). Do you plan of doing any other reviews? Or do you have any other sets? Rapid Rider is another great small one, adding a bit of diversity with a water-based vehicle, and you get the Bandit minifig. Or you could get The Rock Raiders set, and get all of our spelunking friends (don't make me name them all ). Or, if you want a slightly bigger set, Loader Dozer could be the way to go, Axle's a pretty cool minifig too, and you get a rock monster. Sorry if the last comments were detracting from your review, don't think I didn't like it, becuase it was great! I really hope you can do more! Oh, and yes, my torso does come from a female fig... ~Peace

7663 Sith Infiltrator Year: 2007 Number of Pieces: 310 Number of Minifigs: 1 Price: 29.99 USD Brickset Hello everyone, and welcome to my second review on Eurobricks, the Sith Infiltrator! Lets start with a pic of the box, shall we? As you can see, its a Limited Edition set, meaning the fig and set could be worth a lot in the future. This set takes about 20 minuets for the seasoned builder. An overview of the Infiltrator (also know as the Scimitar): As seen in the picture, this ship is very sleek, with very few studs on top (SNOT= Studs Not On Top). Basically, Its the cockpit with two wings (with two "fins" on each wing), attached to the hull. Heres a side view of the Scimitar: Very cool- looking! It lands on two "feet" in the front while the cockpit rests on the ground. Rear view: The back. The outer cockpit is beautiful, a printed piece on the back (no dreaded sticker sheet! (DSS)) and a large printed disc on top: Heres a look at the middle: There is a flick-fire missile (trans-red cone attach to Technic pin) on the inner wing, a trans-red lightsaber blade in the back of the hull, and a trans-red lightsaber blade in between the fins on either side. All of those lightsaber blades may come in handy... Hey, look: the fins open from the wings!: The fins open due to double hinges on each fin. Unfortunately, you have to hold the ship up in order for the bottom fins to open. Now, lets have a look inside the cockpit: To open, you lift the back printed part, which is attached to the printed disc on top, which is attached to a hinge. It opens pretty smoothly, but is somewhat loose, so sometimes it closes on its own. Also, the disc isnt secured well enough to the door, and often breaks off, even with the smallest movement to it. Inside, there is an elevated control panel and two sliding pieces near the floor. This ship also comes with a small speeder bike: Its very cleverly built, and is a really neat addition. See that clear disc on the bottom? It fits perfectly into the sliding pieces in the cockpit: Hmm... whats this?: A hidden compartment! Now this was a very cool idea by TLG, a secret compartment found by taking off the top slope of the hull contains Darth Maul's weapons and tools which include: A (CHROME!) lightsaber hilt, a pair of electrobinouculars, and three probe droids. A closeup of a probe droid: Just a plain, black minifig head with a black lever on top. Finally, the fig: Darth Maul in the flesh plastic. A good fig altogether, with a black hood and lightsaber blades taken from the ship. He did come with a crisp, new black cape (packaged in a small, white cardboard box), but I am currently using it for another fig. Note that this is a limited edition fig, so stock up. A comparison pic of the two Mauls: The 2007 version is on the left, and the 1999 version on the right. Note a few key differences between the two: the new one has smaller red tattoos and a smoother torso. Also, the new one has bigger eyes and a more cartoony look. Maul on the speeder bike: Of course, he fits perfectly in the cockpit wile sitting on the bike, and he can reach the controls: Well, thats about it, here is the... FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, easy and fun, breaks every once in a while. Playability: 7/10, this set has many features, but is very fragile between the cockpit and hull and between the two cockpit pieces. Swooshability: 1/10, too fragile to fly around, plus the flick fire missiles fall out. Minifigs: 9/10, a great fig with a chrome hilt and a double sided blade. A little cartoony. Design: 7/10, very clever techniques, very sleek, but very fragile. Price: 8/10, fair enough, could be a few dollars cheaper. Overall Score: 6.5/10, a very sleek ship with clever building and play techniques, but very, very fragile, and shouldnt be picked up off of the shelf too often. And with that, my review is over, but all of yours are not: comments and thoughts very welcome!! Edited by JimButcher, 15 September 2008 - 02:59 AM. indexed

This set looks like a dandy. Is the Darth Maul fig any different in respect to the torso or head design to the original?

I'll be honest - I don't like this ship at all. It's one of my least favourite ships in the PT and I have to yet buy either one of those sets. I also found it funny that this set was meant to be a Walmart exclusive yet never appeared on the shelves at my Walmart. Anyhow, thanks for the review!

Hey all! So I purchased the remaining three Agents sets I needed, and saw that there was no review up yet for this set! Heres the first batch of parts, and the first instruction bits. The mini figures. The first small vehicles. Heres a mistake that I found in the instruction booklet. There is no difference between steps 2 and 3. The team Inferno boat. This is a nice chunky boat, that looks fairly heavy duty and evily. Its nice to see the smooth disks on the bottom, that LEGO seemingly havnt done in recent boat/plane sets. And the Agents Submarine! This is a nice build aswell. Nice and long, with a few hidden compartments. One for missiles. A place to put the treasure! Some final shots of the completed set! The spare bits! Another special mention has to go out to Slime Face. I think he is my favourite ever LEGO character. The detail on his unique torso is brilliant! His head is fantastic! And his costume just looks great, with the black and green (Plus green is my favourite colour!) Check out the back of his torso, with the slime pouring down! Deep Sea Quest was £34.99 Price ; 9/10 - This is a pretty reasonable price for a fairly substantial set. Parts ; 8/10 - A lot of nice bits, few nice boats bits, and a lot of smooth disk things. Minifigures ; 10/10 As I said Slime Face is my favourite LEGO character, and the details brilliant! Vehicles ; 8/10 Both very good, with some interesting features. Build ; 8/10 A pretty fun build. Overall ; 9/10 Its gotta be, if just for Slime Face alone, but this really is a great set!

Great review, ReZourceman! Your pics really show off the sub well and it's good to see the build in progress. I also have this set but I didn't apply stickers to the sub as I was planning to reuse the nice dark blue pieces. However as shown in your review they do brighten it up a fair bit. I can't say this is my favourite Agents set; the boat is a little oddly proportioned and the sub, although retro looking, has practically no interior and would be difficult to customise to put more in (unlike, say, the clever job Batbrick did with the Penguin sub in his review). The sub kind of looks like some Jules Verneish sea creature - I would have liked it if they'd gone all the way and made it some kind of giant robot jellyfish or squid I do agree with you about Slime Face - he has a fantastic torso with all the slime dripping down which is a bit obscured by the air tank. It's really encouraging that in the last 2 Missions we've had great extra villains added in. The only thing I would add about the octopus is that the glow in the dark plastic is mixed in unevenly with the aqua blue, so it doesn't glow in the dark evenly - it's kind of like the Mars Mission jellies in that respect though much cooler! Thanks again for the great review!

Sort of keep the retro feel but make it bigger. With the 8636 sub, there's really only room for one Agent to sit and despite its size, there's just a few (not amazingly great) functions such as the hidden chest and missiles.

Great review. This set totally OWNS Alpha Team Deep Sea. The sub design actually LOOKS like a sub, the figures are way better, the acessories are better - everything is better! Agents may have my vote for the best theme of the year. Quote I wonder if it will last longer than one year (unlike other recent one-and-done themes). Oh don't worry - a second wave will be coming next year. This was confirmed by both legomilk and in an interview with an Agents designer.

I forgot to comment on this review! Great job ReZourceman, like svelte-corps said your pics really show off the set and what there is to it. I just ordered this and the volcano base off S@h and I can't wait for them to come, so I'll comment on these reviews I forgot about I love the Inferno boat, as you say in your review it looks very heavy duty and ready to take on the Agents. The sub I quite like from the look of it, though there is the problem of too little space I will try and correct that. The dark blue is especially good. And I love Slime Face, his torso is very cool. svelte_corps, on Jul 11 2008, 09:14 AM, said: I can't say this is my favourite Agents set; the boat is a little oddly proportioned and the sub, although retro looking, has practically no interior and would be difficult to customise to put more in (unlike, say, the clever job Batbrick did with the Penguin sub in his review).

Probably the easiest part to change would be the front where the missiles are and the treasure chest slides out - you could make a sizeable compartment there. However the middle section is so narrow and the end fins are just that - fins - that it might be harder to expand without changing the shape of the sub. You'll find out soon when yours arrives!

It's not really clear but since all the other mutants are evil (or at least controlled by Dr Inferno), it's probably a safe bet the squid is too. Slime Face's head is different to the Joker bombs - different eyes and teeth (although the smile is similar I guess) and the slime marks are much more apparent in the flesh (or ABS) although they don't photograph that way.

6927 All Terrain Vehicle Year Released: 1981 Piece Count: 167 Minifigs: 2 List Price: $14.50 A very unique vehicle in the Classic Space collection was this "All-Terrain Vehicle" which I always considered more along the line of a Mobile Lab. The set introduced/infused white and black bricks with classic blue space pieces. The result was this great classic vehicle. The set includes two figs (still red and white): Here's a view of the vehicle which is really two components, the vehicle itself and the lab section: I absolutely loved the the blue windshield slopes (2 included), and the unique upside-down large blue slope: In the back of the vehicle is the blue lab: The back section of the vehicle has hinges that allow the jets sections to open: The brick design fits perfectly into the lab, and when opened, the lab falls to the ground: NOTE: the little round trans. red 1x1s allow the lab to slide up and forward when the jet sections are closed. I tried taking off the red 1x1s and the lab does not lift as easily with them. The design is very clever, esp. for a classic set. Here's a shot of the stand-alone lab: Unlike earlier Classic Space windows, this set has train window frames with yellow windows. The top of the lab lifts up for playability: Inside the lab are several computers and a swivel chair: Back to the vehicle, here's a shot of the cockpit with white steering wheel: The left side has an upside-down wrench and black antenna: The right side, a walkie-talkie and another antenna. The antennas can be used as breaks to keep the middle wheels from moving: Here's ashot of the under carriage: And a final shot of the complete set: For those of you following my Classic Space reviews, this is review number 9 of 10. My final review of an-all time favorite will be coming soon. Hope you enjoyed this review. Comments are always welcome.

This is a great little set. I like how it combines two very different color schemes for different parts of the model. I have made some slight modifications to mine, adding a roof on the vehicle and a back wall on the outpost. Also, those white 1x1 headlight plates at the front are thinner than the modern kind and seem to be quite weak. I got this set off ebay a while ago and one of them was broken in shipping, even though the set was otherwise in display model condition, and the other one broke off while I was building the set. I replaced them with the newer variety. mutex, on Jul 10 2008, 11:37 PM, said: My only complain about this set was that I found that the wheels where too small , I had some trouble passing the rover over the little "craters-mountains" of the space plates The only bad thing about this set is the name.

Give me an excuse to sneak into your house, and let me have a feel of these Classic Space sets. I never had a chance to have any experience with the Classic Space sets. Through your recent reviews on these, it gave me a wider perspective of space. I loved to play space as a child such as the late classic and Futuron sets. Back to the review, this 6927 is a great mobile command center vehicle suitable for all kinds of harsh terrain in the unknown space. The 6 big wheels are real solid and firm back in those days. Transparent blue windscreen at the front, is wonderful. I just love these parts, especially when it's in blue. 4 computer printed tiles. Aren't LEGO so generous back in those days, when printed parts are more commonly available unlike now. It's a real nice set. However, there is one thing I don't understand about this design. Why is the driver seat has a wide back with no cover behind? And, the command center has no door at the back? I understand that these Space guys are always carrying their helmet around, for oxygen supply. I wonder if there is a better answer to it.

The extra space was probably for the oxygen tanks on the figs. It makes taking them off a lot easier. As for the lab/control center, I never had an issue with it being open. I think this was just for playability. One could always "pretend" that some sort of invisible force ray closed the side when activated. Great comments! I love hearing what others think of these classics.

I understand that these Space guys are always carrying their helmet around, for oxygen supply. I wonder if there is a better answer to it. I just modified mine to make everything fully enclosed: Edited by CP5670, 11 July 2008 - 06:39 PM.

TheBrickster, on Jul 11 2008, 10:16 PM, said: Yes. The extra space was probably for the oxygen tanks on the figs. It makes taking them off a lot easier. As for the lab/control center, I never had an issue with it being open. I think this was just for playability. One could always "pretend" that some sort of invisible force ray closed the side when activated. Invisible force field/ray? That is a very neat idea. I don't have much problem with it either. Was just curious about the design, as I am not very familar with Classic Space. I supposed the oxygen tanks is quite big to carry around, especially when the vehicle is so cramped. These allowance of space, makes them much mobile to move about in the vehicle. CP5670, on Jul 12 2008, 02:39 AM, said: I just modified mine to make everything fully enclosed: Great job! Thanks for sharing and answering the question I posted above. I love the way you modify the front and back. Now, I need to find where is the entrance to the Mobile Command Center.

i've always associated this set with 6929, the Voyager. they're of the same timeframe and more or less the same style. 6927 is without any doubt my favourite ground vehicle of space. it was pretty simple, but it was such a creative set. the stories you could tell with this model... g... most defenitely in my top 5 of space sets...

This set never got me as a kid. I suspect it was because of the wheels; I had mostly Basic sets so it would have been more of the same. Looking at it now I can see I have misjudged it, and I love the lab-lift method. I'm going to have to build this to see it in action! Thanks for another great review.

Great review! All-Terrain Vehicle was one of my two favorite LEGO sets ever. I have to include a shot of the back of the box, because I love the ideas LEGO provided for this set: hewman, on Jul 11 2008, 01:11 AM, said: Very nice Blacktron-themed 6927! CP5670, on Jul 11 2008, 01:39 PM, said: I just modified mine to make everything fully enclosed: I love your modified 6927 with the enclosed front. 2 weeks ago I modified my All-Terrain Vehicle as well, in a similar way, but just *slightly* more modified from the original. I call it: 6927-C 'All-Terrain Vehicle Improved Class' a few clues for anyone to easily build this themselves: Also, a much more extensive modification/MOC that I call 6927-W "All-Terrain Warrior" Quote 6927-W 'All-Terrain Warrior' I wanted to make a combat variant of 6927, so I used the 6927-C Improved Class as the starting point and went from there. I added a completely new forward-cab, close to the ground, for a ground--observer to monitor the terrain. I added even larger wheels, allowing this variant to truly be "all terrain", ...besides, what good is it having a combat vehicle if it gets stuck in the middle of a firefight? The 6927-W has a five man crew: a driver, a gunner who also serves as overall-commander, a terrain observer in the very front. In the lab are the weapons systems officer and computer/tech specialist. The All-Terrain Warrior vehicle portion is armed with lasers and blaster cannons, with options for other weapons. There are short-range nuclear rockets on the lab, guided by the rader control. The lab now has blast-proof shutters on the windows protecting the crew from rocket blast. Additional protection can be added to the lab, if-need-be, such as more extensive blast-shielding. All-in-all, the All-Terrain Warrior is a beast of a machine. Two 6927s can protect an entire convoy of standard 6927 or 6927-C. These are my very first attempts at modification and doing a MOC of Classic Space LEGO! Edited by ParallaxScroll, 29 August 2009 - 03:03 AM.

Yeah, first time that I am getting a set before everyone.^^ First of all: The package The european version has no "Limited Edition" button. Hooray!!! Sorry for the blurry back-shot. We see the hospital back, a few bubbles with set functions and a little comic. Comic: Bubbles: The figures are injured Spongebob, Patrick and the new Fish Doctor. Spongebob has a headprint... ...and a backprint (other than the normal Spongebob). Spongebob and injured Bob: The set comes with two litters. The ambulance car is a bit extraordinary. I don´t know how the car is like in the show (and I saw a lot of episodes) but it looks a bit strange, mostly because the weehls are too small. Of course we get another SS (not so D this time). The litter fits in the back, with help of this lid. I wish it would be the hinge-lid from before 2004... Now we come to the meanpart of the set: The hospital! The entrance has got babyblue traindoors and a hudge sign that shows "Emergency". The tubes are nearly everywhere in this set. I was getting insane when I came to the part, where I must put the stickers on the tubes. This parts are very usefull, but I wanted that the set looks good, because I will display it. So I stickered just two of the parts and not all four. Now we come to the interroir: The doctor has a desk with computer. Sadly it´s not very well placed and he must duck because of his fin. Next to the door, we get this little case, wash basin and two drawers. Again we get stickers... Not that I don´t like stickers. It´s just: Everytime I get to the part where I must put the stickers on, I think how I can re-use the model and if I rebuild the model, later and and and... I hate it to deside! A few posters are in it, too. The set is a great addittion to your own Bikino Bottom, but the playability is not very big for the kids. They can just play that Patrick steals the ambulance car, like shown on the package, and is hitting Spongebob. Than the drive back, the doctor gives Spongebob two medicines and let him go. I bought the set mostly because of the parts (tubes in lightbley and a few woodpieces). But I am thinking about let it stand in my little Bikini Bottom (just consist of Crusty Crab and Chum Bucket). Playability: 3/10 Figures: 10/10 Price: 8/10 Design: 9/10 TOTAL: 30/40

In the USA it´s not aviable, now. I think it costs as much as the rocket ride (30$). @ Mrs Pegleg: He has the same, short pants, like in the other sets.

My fish doctor has the torso from 7902 Doctor's Car, which is unfortunate, because the other torso is more stylized and cartoonish, I think. However, I did have that mad scientist lab set, so a bit of digging through my old collection will hopefully yield the better torso.

I recently bought this set for my daughters birthday. It's the first BELVILLE set that I've bought for her so it's a bit of an experiment. The house is 5 rooms and it's made up of mostly large pieces. There still is a decent amount of normal LEGO in it though. The doorways in the house align when it is opened out. Starting with the bathroom, included is a shower, toilet, sink with vanity and a baby potty. The mirror sticker is one of the few that I put on. The open plan lounge/kitchen/dining room is well appointed as well and it has a nice glass table and coffee machine. The kitchen chairs are Fabuland parts... and don't work really well. It seems they are having jellyfish for dinner! The clock is the only printed part in the set. Upstairs is a baby room and the master bedroom. The radio and the TV (not shown) were stickers to my disappointment. Up top is an extra room suitable for reading. (Those antenna things were made from spare parts by my daughter. I have no idea what they are supposed to be... ) There are some stickers that go on the back, but I didn't put them on. As it is the set looks OK this way, but since it is a dolls house it doesn't really matter. I do think though that the fireplace should have been given a back. The BBQ is made from normal parts and is quite effective. I think it uses the same light brick that's in the 4998 Stegosaurus set. My kids were using it as a torch before my grumbling ruined their fun... Like all BELVILLE sets, the highlight is arguably the accessories. I'll be borrowing a few of these from time to time... Here is the controversial baby catapult. As you can see, it works OK, but LEGO probably should have tried a bit harder. We also bought for her 7583 Playful Puppy. It also comes with some nice accessories, but not enough to justify buying unless you want the rest of the parts. Poor puppy; where does he sleep? Here is my daughter assembling it. She made me make the house though as she wanted to play a game we bought her. (Note the LEGO drink bottles! ) I didn't take any photos of the figures as they don't seem to be anything new, but I can if people want me to. At the time I was in bit of a hurry as I took these before bed so I wouldn't be stressed if the kids broke it the next day. Overall, these sets seem overpriced to me, and hard to justify unless you actually want a buildable doll's house. (Which we did.) It's still too early to tell if my daughter likes it or not... but at this stage it seems she lost interest in a few days. She does tend to go back to toys though.

Yay! It's good to see your kids get to build some stuff too, Sinner . All through the review I was thinking 'This was a present - but who actually put it together?' so I'm glad the last pic cleared things up As for the set - it looks much bigger than I expected - I think it does make a good sized dollhouse. There are a stack of nice pieces in there - cupboards, oven, trans-blue 2x5 bricks, all the accessories, plants, flowers, food, the light-up brick, the pink roof slopes - but not enough to justify the $AUD129 retail price. Maybe on sale I'd pick it up and resell the Belville figs but David Jones hasn't even had a regular 20% off Lego sale for the whole of this year that I've seen. I think the Playful Puppy set is a horrendous ripoff for $AUD20 though. I agree with the baby catapult - the range is terrible. Lego just isn't trying any more, is it? At least they've moved on from throwing cats off three storey buildings. 2 questions though. 1) Was it a fun build? 2) Are those large figs anatomically correct under their frou-frou finery? If not, what the hell are they doing in the second pic whilst baby Sylvia explores the oven?

Excellent review! It's nice to see how... it's nice to see how ... ... it's nice ... Okay, I can't get over the sex in the bedroom and the unattended baby crawling into the oven. I didn't read anything else except, where does the puppy sleep and my daughter made me build this. You are sick and twisted and that's why I love you! It seems you are coining the Belville edge. Now will you please stop sitting around eating clams and get that baby out of the oven or make the fun in the bedroom a three-way? Please! Thank you PS. OK, I read it. I want the baby toilet and I think the jellyfish is supposed to be a jello-mold. I bet you knew that. The fireplace lattice look like the Harry Potter one and not the Fabuland one. Boo!! Wienies. When your daughter outgrows it, will you turn it into a Belleville Star Wars MOC please? Thank you in advance

Now as for the kiddies, in ovens, make sure they are not over cooked they can be stringy , and as for the couple up stairs, now we at least know what you do with your mini figs when no one is looking/ lego sets in public places , just following your name sake i guess And i must say Lego, shame, shame, that catapult needs reviwing, hardly even make a dent in a castle wall!

I was sort of hoping for a flick-fire baby. Still, this looks decent, for what it is, I guess. Obviously, it really is all about the accessories, and it's got 'em, but not enough to make me spend that kind of cash, and I don't even mind having a pile of pink parts around. If you throw in a complete turkey or some birthday cakes, it's a slam dunk, but as it is... eh. Thanks for the review, though, it's very nicely presented and leaves no doubt in my mind as to just how easy this set would be to misuse for other purposes.

Sinner!!! You know, I had never seen a BELVILLE set in any review with such great pictures before! I just can't take my eyes off, in the Master Bedroom. The scene is quite, a little hot. Enough of me, peeping up there. Let's take a look at the interior. I am very surprised by its construction of the house. It's quite big and is nice of you to buy a great sweet gift for your daughter. I am very sure, she will enjoyed playing with it. Somehow, it reminded me of Barbie Doll products. Maybe, its too pinkish for me. The accessories is the "plus factor" in any BELVILLE sets. It offered quite a handful of great accessories to add into any types of MOCs construction to add in the plus factor in it. Sinner, you are a very nice Dad! I like how parents, buy educational toys for their children to expand their imaginations instead of sitting in a couch playing video games and etc.

If your daughter is anything like mine, you will definitely get your money's worth out of it. However ... as soon as my daughter says she's done with it, I plan on raiding the sets for all those great food and accessory bits. Patience .... Great review, by the way. The Belville sets are indeed overpriced, but they're probably Lego's best attempt at wooing the girl audience (I still hate the fact that TLC thinks they need separate "boy" themes and "girl" themes, but whatever). They're a very nice alternative to Barbie -- you get posable figures with realistic body proportions, plus some creativity and building aspects thrown in.

I bought this today, mainly because it was 25% off, but I'd been eyeing it for a long time. The accessories truly are brilliant! There's so much here to be pillaged for other uses, as people have said. I picked up heaps of new parts I've never had, or rare ones in even rarer colours. To be honest, I was surprised and impressed by the range and versatility of the regular bricks as well. When you look at the box art, what jumps out at you are the giant pink walls and curved pieces, but there's a nice amount of white arches and lime green bricks, not to mention all the windows and the trans blue 1x2x5 bricks. And plants! It's a good thing the target audience likes stickers though, there's more here than I've seen on any set except the 7709 Sentai Fortress! I think they were aiming for one sticker per page of instructions I hope Belville returns in 2010 Thanks for the review, Sieggy! Did your daughter ever go back to it?

I recognize the clock! It came with my old airport set 6392 back in 85! In fact according to Peeron it mostly came out in train stations Link Belville looks horrible to me Too barbie-ish and does not look Lego at all. Would prefer they went with Paradisa instead.

7655: Clone Battle Pack Year: 2007 Number of pieces: 58 Number of minifigs: 4 Price: 9.99 USD Brickset Welcome to my third review on Eurobricks, I hope you enjoy! While at any store that sells LEGO (Target, Wal-Mart, TRU, etc.), you will notice that the clone battle packs on the shelf are way fewer in number than the droids battle pack. As you might guess, the clones are way more popular, and finding them gets harder and harder as the release date of this set goes farther into the past. So stock up! Alright, heres a pic of the box: A small box, as expected for inexpensive sets like these. Note the "Build your army" button on the front: TLG obviously is encouraging customers to buy multiples, and with good reason, which will be explained later in this review. Well, lets get straight to it: The contents of this set. You will notice a speeder bike, a gun turret, and some clones. Looking good so far! Lets have a look at the turret: An excellent Star Wars element to have around, especially for MOCing. It is very cleverly built, using a tire guard from CITY sets for the general shape of the turret mount. All you have to do is attach the (new mold! explained later) gun to the 2x1 plate with the center stud, and... Presto! I wonder how the clones build these turrets to fast in the middle of battle... A rear view: With a clone mounted: My only gripe about the turret is that you have to take off the gun in order for every clone to have a gun. Now, we move on to the vehicle of the set, the speeder bike: A rather sleek and good looking bike, with some useful pieces on it as well, such as the blue cones, the megaphones, and the engines. Some say it looks bare without the figs mounted on it, but I think it looks just fine. The commander drives while a trooper shoots on the back. A side view: And a rear view: My only gripe is the same as the turret: you have to remove the back gun for all the clones to have weapons while on foot. The back pistol attaches to a 2x2 round studded plate with a Technic hole in the middle. Finnaly, here are the new guns: This set comes with 1 new blaster rifle and three new pistols. It could have included one more rifle for the turret. And of course, the figs: Includes: 1 yellow commander (lovely fig), 1 Shocktrooper (comes with a pair of elctrobinouculars), and two regular troopers (so clean and white). The figs are excellent, all that any SW or LEGO fan should want. It could have maybe included one more regular trooper, but that might be pushing it. Thats all for now, folks, here is the... FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, extremely easy, should take the seasoned builder about 5 minutes to complete. A fun build, though. Playability: 5/10, I guess you can get this with the droid battle pack and make them battle, but this set has no real play features of its own. But it is good for collecting troops and using them for MOCs. Swooshability: 9/10, I guess you can zoom the speeder bike around... Minifigs: 10/10, four great figs that should be bought in multiples, a great army builder. Design: 10/10, a clever turret, an awesome speeder, and four great clones. What more do you need in a 10 dollar set? Price: 8/10, not bad I suppose, but if you calculate a dime for each piece, this set should come out to 5-6 dollars. But still, billions of these are being sold world-wide, and TLG is making a ton of money off of them. Overall score: 9.5/10, a truly memorable set, one that will be a favorite for ages to come, and very popular. A great army builder for a small price, plus vehicle and turret! With only a few very minor flaws, this set is one of the best of Star Wars. And this concludes my review, and as always, comments are most welcome.

Nice review! I got over the gun problem with the shockie since the rebel in the Y-Wing doesn't need one. I wish I could have gotten more of these but I'll know for next time.

I believe there's another set that has Star Corps Trooper with an orange pauldron. Is it any better?

7654: Droids Battle Pack. Year: 2007 Number of pieces: 102 Number of minifigs: 7 Price: 9.99 USD Brickset Hi everybody, and welcome to my fourth review on Eurobricks. Today, I will review the Droid Bttle Pack set. NOTE: This set originally came with four megaphone blasters for each battle droid, but I replaced them (along with the crooked arms) with the new blaster pistols and new twisted arms. A picture of the box: As it is on the shelves of major-retail stores. A small box, as expected for inexpensive sets like these. Note the "Build your army" button on the front: TLG obviously is encouraging customers to buy multiples, and with good reason, which will be explained later in this review. An overview of the set's content: You can see a droid carrying vehicle, a STAP, and some battle/ super battle droids. A look at the carrier: A light tank. Note the guns on the front: The guns and cockpit can turn a little bit left and right from the main body. Also, the guns can move up and down, free from the cockpit: And check out the cockpit: Two 2x1 center studded plates side by side for the pilot to stand on. Now, moving on to the STAP: A small, very useful vehicle in the SW universe. These are seen frequently in both the movies and games (as well as other multimedia). The design is very clever, using vertical building and a clear stand. Rear view: The guns/ handlebars can go this far back: And finally, the figs: The figs are very good, but very common. We havent seen SBDs in a while, and now instead of metallic blue, they are metallic dark grey. The worst part of this set is that the battle droids have the old arms and guns, while the droids in the MTT and clone pack (both of the same year as this) have the new ones. I wonder why TLG decided to do that... again, This set originally came with four megaphone blasters for each battle droid, but I replaced them (along with the crooked arms) with the new blaster pistols and new twisted arms. So thats about it, heres the... FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, very easy, should take the seasoned builder about 5-10 minutes. Playability: 6/10, has a few play feature, but nothing exciting. Is good for MOCs and army building. Swooshability: 8/10, I suppose you could fly around the STAP... Minifigs: 7/10, the battle droids are good, but very common, and the dont come with new arms or guns. The SBDs are very nice, and in a new color. All figs are great for army building. Design: 8/10, the STAP was clever, but the carrier was a little bulky. Price: 10/10, as fair as it gets. Overall: 7.5/10, the figs are great to have and make MOCs and armies, and the vehicles are pretty cool (the carrier is a little lame). The main problem with this set is that the BDs dont get the new guns or arms, so they dont fit in with all the new sets. Also, droids arent as cool as clones. But the price is very fair. And now, my review has ended. Unfortunately, I believe this will be my last review for a long time for two reasons: one, the remaining sets that arent done (according to KimT's index) I either don't have or are broken or have missing pieces. and two, my budget is low right now, and I wont be able to get the Clone Wars sets right when they are released, so someone will probably beat me to reviewing them. Too bad, because I would love to do an RGS review... well, as always, comments very welcome!
