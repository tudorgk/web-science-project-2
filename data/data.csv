One was a set of two crater plates, and the other, this very useful Landing Plate set. Not much to review, but worth sharing a few images: The landing plate: And T-Plate: The two plates connect to form this very nice Classic Space landing platform: Set 497, Galaxy Explorer included the landing platform, but the one that I had was lighter in color than the one contained in this set (at least the yellow circle). Future Lego space sets could benefit by having similar road plates. Share your thoughts."

This is was I did when I wanted to create the Blacktron II in the Futuron colour scheme. Also I tend to like both sets of base plates, I bought the black ones myself and they were of great use but there more for creating the idea of a city or space station, something more completely man made. The gray ones give a better look of the roads being laid over bare rock especially when you introduce the plates with the craters. I would love to see a 48*48 baseplate with roads through them which would allow more building space on the side and maybe some craters. Also 48*48 baseplates with craters but a few different kinds to create more or a realistic look and less of a repeating pattern. And with all those rocks you have to put everything up on supports, much better looking bases then."

I'm building my carrier MOC around one but don't have anything planned for the others. These baseplates are still relatively common on ebay for their age. I see MISB packs on there every few weeks and they tend to sell for around $20. The older kind (in the OP) are much harder to come by. Edited by CP5670, 09 July 2008 - 10:18 PM."

(I'll explain why later...) This set in particular is interesting as it came out in two versions; one that includes the first minifigs and another that included the non-armless type. (Set 709.) The police signs are stickers, and are in surprisingly good condition considering the age of the set. (I am missing one sticker on the front though.) Note the Technic Bush and Axel; they are the old type. The position of the second figure is not a mistake; I think he's supposed to be sitting down.... The first boats out by LEGO needed a weighted keel to prevent them.... keeling over. (I have tested this!) I suspect this is because of the density of the old hulls and the flat bottom... but I could be wrong. (It can't be just because of the flat bottom as the new cargo ship doesn't need one.) The keel in detail. The bottom extension is for a motor. (Not included, nor made by LEGO at the time.) The keel had longer studs. Even now it holds extra firmly. This is why I prefer the old design. You can extend or shorten the hulls as you please, or even insert other LEGO in the middle. You can easily add wheels or any other piece to the bottom of these hulls. I wish they would go back to this idea; the 4+ hulls were of this concept but were too wide. (Probably so the keel wasn't needed.) The old minifigs aside from having odd feet and no arms had a normal stud as the neck. Thus when you turn the head it tends to come off. I love this set!"

Among the bricks were instructions and pieces for an almost complete set 345 from 1969. I was very excited to find this out, so I put it together. I recently took it apart and re-assembled it, taking photographs along the way for the sake of Eurobricks. So, without further ado, set 345: House With Car. First off is the car. This was still constructed in the bucket of bricks I received, so I never took it apart: Next I'll show you the instructions. Lots of added bricks per step, which was fun. However, the angle of the instructions sometimes made it difficult to find where things were supposed to go. The in-build shots. Finally, an all-around view of the finished set.

First, let me say that this set was truly ""ahead of it's time"". It introduced new building concepts (such as the hinge and new figs (most were still the armless, faceless mini-figs during this time). This set introduced me to Castle which was my first real favorite theme. I enjoyed breaking it out from the garage and building it again. The majority of the pieces are 1x1, 1x2, 1x3, 1x4, 1x6, and 1x8 standard yellow bricks. The set also includes yellow 1x4, 1x6x2, and 1x8x2 arches, yellow 2x2, 2x3, and 2x4 bricks, various grey plates, 1x2 black inverted slopes, red drawbridge pieces, two classic red castle doors, 8 hinges (2 for each corner), and a few other nifty pieces including six red 1x1 windows. A complete inventory is available at Peeron: 375 Inventory. A view from the front. The drawbridge is 6x8. The front tower stands 12 1/3 bricks high (plenty of room for horses). The drawbridge does work. The string (originally black) is attached to the opposite side between a plate and the arches. The right side of the castle (identical to the left). I've always loved the 2x2x3 sloped bricks (and corner pieces): The back. I love these red doors. A 1x4 brick attached to the other side of the baseplate keeps intruders out. That banner was the original sticker piece. Notice the wear. The rear tower, largest of the towers: And backside: Two hinges at each of the corners allow the corners to open for playability: Before opening: Open: Lots of arches add to the detail of the inner walls: Inner front: This set included 14 figs (how about that for quantity). Unfortunately, I peeled off worn stickers from the shields and the breast plates years ago. The blue castle guards and knights are the keepers of the castle. I still think that these helmets are the best Lego ever made. They just look good. The black and white knights: And the red knights: I've always prefered to use the black and red guards and flags from the knight's joust set(s): Conclusion The Yellow Castle is truly a classic set and I'm so glad I kept the pieces to this together after all these years. If you have a chance to buy one or even obtain the set instructions, it's worth building and wouldn't be difficult to substitute grey or other colors. I hope you enjoyed this review and feel free to share your comments."

I threw away the box to this set years ago- just lucky to still have all the pieces. With standard pieces, you can build all these alternates and many more. That's why I don't particularly care for the new castles (like Vladek's). They make building so difficult and duplicate pieces are so limited.

I ended up with a PowerPoint sheet of multiple shields and torso designs. Printed on sticker pages from a good quality photo-printer gives you very nice stickers. The hard part is cutting them.

Yes, I hear you younger FOLs say this meant we had less variety at the time, but at least we did not have to go on a frenzy to get them all in just 1 or 2 years before they disappeared (to re-appear on the secondary market at crazy prices). Anyway, I also realise this set is older than me by 5 years (at least the first boxes of this set). I think my parents bought it when I was something like 1/2 year old, or even before, as my Father really liked the Hobby Set line and took any chance to get one, you know, for the kids, when theyâ€™ll be old enough to play with themâ€¦ I am really happy my Father did it, too. As a matter of fact, this has always been one of my favourite non-minifigure scale sets. I know younger eyes will look on it and wonder how we could love and enjoy a model like this, so blocky and rough. Just remember this was the best TLG designers could do with the bricks available at the time. Enough about memories; letâ€™s start with the review! The Box Front The front of the box (here cut and folded to save space) shows the Harley Davidson 1000cc in all its glory upon a nice town landscape. I really appreciate how TLG box designers used a real life photo of the model in a real life environment to give this Hobby Set a better background. Moreover, the landscape does not distract the eye, even with its lights, since the focus is strongly set on the motorbike itself. Back (and sides) The back of the box shows the model on a more neutral background and from another angle. We can see the stickers in place (take a good look at them here, because I did not apply them). The right side we also see a pic of the set from the front, and one with a child playing with it. In this latter shot, the model rests upon a nice black box with a Harley Davidson sign on it. I frankly do not remember if this was some sort of tray or smaller box within the LEGO one or if it is meant for publicity only. Another thing we can notice on the right-most side of the box is a white band, right below the LEGO logo, sporting the sign â€˜Designed for experienced LEGO buildersâ€™ in various languages. All in all, a really well done and professional job. Contents Inside This set includes a number of parts in mainly Black, White and Light Grey. Some Blue and Yellow add nice touches of colour to the total. The partsâ€™ selection is not mind-blowing, as most of the pieces had been in production, in these same colours for years. Anyway, Iâ€™d like to focus on a couple of details: The Milky White Technic axles as well as the Red Technic Bush Old 2 are among my favourite parts. The bushes, in particular, are quite useful to build more sturdy looking tubes than what can be achieved with the newer and slimmer ones. It would seem that the tile pieces appeared in the â€˜without groveâ€™ version as a standard and in the â€˜with groveâ€™ version as alternates (see Bricklink inventory). Notice, though that the box (above) and instructionsâ€™ (below) pictures all show the â€˜with groveâ€™ variety. As said, there are no re-coloured parts in this set. New pieces The few new molds used in this set are: Black and White Slope, Inverted 45 2 x 2 Old Type with Round Bottom Tube, Black Technic, Brick 1 x 2 with Hole Type II and Red Hinge Plate 2 x 4 with Articulated Joint â€“ Male and Female. The most interesting piece from this lot, as many of you will have noticed is the Technic, Brick 1 x 2 with Hole Type II. This kind of technic brick was use during 1976 and 1977 only. It would seem TLG tried a new design variant, which did not meet success and was later replaced with the standard bricks again. Nonetheless, Iâ€™m sure that people who own these bricks like them for the unusual design and the possibilities they offer into adding details to their creations. Instructions Cover â€“ As usual, the instructions are not organised in the form of a booklet, but they consist of a folded double printed sheet. The â€˜coverâ€™ shows again the same shot as the front of the box, with bigger LEGO logo and set number and without the other additional information. â€˜Back coverâ€™ â€“ Here we see the full name of the set: Harley-Davidson FLH 1200. This makes me wonder: why is this set known as 394 Harley Davidson 1000cc when it is indeed a 1200cc? Anyway, what really makes me love this page is the list of stats below the photo, and in particular these two lines: H.P. (?)/(not given). This calls for just one question: why did Harley-Davidson not release this info? My opinion is that since this is a motorbike built for the Police, they did not have permission to share the specifications on the motor, which was probably customised either by Harley-Davidson upon request or by the Police themselves. â€˜Random pageâ€™ â€“ As expected, no call-outs here, but the build is pretty straight forward and does not need them (apart for one passage weâ€™ll see later). The colours are easy to tell apart (in the end there is no Dark Grey in this set that could be confused with Black). Again, notice how the instructions include the â€˜with groveâ€™ tiles and not the older ones. Maybe this was changed during the long time this set stayed in production? The â€˜last pageâ€™ shows other four models included in the Hobby Set line. Unfortunately, I own only one of them: the 396 Thatcher Perkins Locomotive. Indeed, I would have liked to have them all! Building Start The handle bars look a bit too squared to me, but itâ€™s just a minor feature, and the overall shape is still good in my opinion. Notice the red hinge plate, which will be almost totally hidden in the finished model (see below), and the blue tiles which work as indicators. The first steps, used to build the front wheel and windshield are really easy, until you get to the wheel. In facts, the instructions do not show clearly all the pieces needed for it, and I found myself with a â€˜floatingâ€™ wheel for the absence of one of the Red Technic Bush Old 2 on one side (the one not visible on the instructions, of course). Not a big deal, but something that could have been done better. Motor and seat The second part of the build includes the motor, seat and â€˜saddle bagsâ€™. The technique used for the motor, or better the radiator, is very clever. To get the ridged feel, TLG designers used 4 Light Grey plates stuck one on the other but not completely in contact. This way, the studs, while keeping the plates in position, keep them raised from one another at the same time. The Yellow round bricks add some details and colour touches to this predominantly Light Grey parts of the vehicle. The use of the Engine, Smooth Small, 1 x 2 Side Plates for the exhaust pipes, while quite clever, still looks a bit strange to me. Iâ€™m mostly used to see them in airplanes, helicopters and spaceships. â€˜Saddle-bagsâ€™, a simple build for one of the iconic parts of this motorcycle. Here you see them in place, as well as get a look at the finished seat. I like how LEGO designers managed to make its shape with just a few quite big bricks. The â€˜saddle bagsâ€™ are a really nice touch, and they work perfectly when compared to the original. This is the rear wheel. As said before, only when you get to this passage in the instruction you get a real understanding of how the front wheel is supposed to be mounted as well. Careful readers will notice how this is not one of the original wheels in this set. The original ones were mounted using the Technic, Gear Expert Builder 9 Tooth. Unfortunately, I could only find one of them in my collection, an itâ€™s used as the front wheel. By adding the rear wheel (which is shown from a better angle in the instructions), we complete the model. Notice how the two technic bricks supporting the wheel are held in position by two 2x1 plates. I think this was a bad case of â€˜building by compartmentsâ€™ mentality: if TLG designers had considered this a bit more, they would have used 2 4x1 plates instead of 4 2x1. On the other hand, this is not the worst case I have seen in a LEGO set, and they keep up the tradition nowadays too. Finished set Front And here it is our fancy Police Harley-Davidson! Indeed, the front looks blocky and quite horrible to our eyes, but again, it was almost the best that could be done at the time. I only wish they had made it a little less bulky, even though this build is clearly thought to give better stability to the wheel. The Blue tiles work nicely to emphasise the indicators, the slightly unsightly red plate is normally covered by the plate sticker and the windshield, albeit being hard to see through, is nicely shaped. Back The back side is less detailed than the front, but shows the red light and antenna which are typical of the Police motorbikes from this period. How many times have we seen this angle in the chase scenes from TV shows like â€œCHiPsâ€? Side All in all, this model looks pretty sturdy (apart for the antenna, which falls off all too easily) and detailed, especially considering the limited variety of parts available and used at the time. They even got so far to put a 2x2 tile as kick-stand to display it without fear of it falling on the sides! Bonus images Size comparison? What I never understood about this set is what scale it is meant to be. I mean, it is clearly not minifig-scale, and it could not be technic-fig-scale (those came later). But it is not even Miniland scale! Moreover, the only other model with the same scale is the other Hobby Set motorbike, as the cars have a scale of their own and the Thatcher uses still another one! Final comments Overall, this is a great set for collectors of old models and motorbike fans, or both. It does not sport a huge variety of bricks, but was a good choice at the time, and even if the result is matter-of-fact blocky when compared to the original, it implements some good solutions to minimise the LEGO brick appearance and maximise the similarity as much as possible. Design & Colour scheme â€“ 9/10 (The design is as accurate as possible, apart for the front mudguard maybe, and the colours are completely in line for a Police vehicle. The solutions and details included in this set justify the â€˜Expert buildersâ€™ label and add to the appearance, and, why not, playability of the model.) Parts - 8/10 (Not a huge selection, and very few new molds. Nonetheless, a good source of Black and White standard parts for MOCs and one of the few sources for the extra rare Technic, Brick 1 x 2 with Hole Type II pieces.) Playability - 9/10 (A sturdy model which can take some serious play and swoosh-ing without falling apart. The easily detachable antenna and the lack of an appropriate scale interaction with most other models make it lose one point, though.) Build - 7/10 (Pretty straight forward, with few nice solutions and an already mentioned slightly obscure passage in the instructions.) Price - 5/10 (Like most older models, especially the Hobby Set and Model Team ones, this set can be found at reasonable prices only rarely. Most of the times, people are asked shameful prices for such a smallish set.) Overall: 8/10 Very good. As always, questions, comments, and pic requests welcome!

In facts, he gave it to me as a present for my first half year. Of course, that is to say he bought it for himself and used me as the official excuse! When I grew up, at first I found it to be quite boring: no minifigures, limited play features; in the end, it was just a locomotive! It soon went to forgotten-land. Then, when I was about 10 years old, I one day found again the instructionsâ€™ â€˜bookletâ€™ and saw this bright coloured big steam engine, and I suddenly wanted to build it again. It would seem I finally got to the right age (at least for me) to appreciate the design of this great set. But enough about memories; letâ€™s start with the review! The Box Front The front of the box (here cut and folded to save space) shows the Thatcher Perkins Locomotive in all its glory upon a nice countryside landscape. I really appreciate how TLG box designers used a real life environment made of sand, gravel and pebbles to give this Hobby Set a better background. Moreover, the landscape does not distract the eye, since the focus is strongly set on the locomotive itself. The box measures about 39.5 x 24.5 x 5.5 centimetres, or 15.56 x 9.65 x 2.17 inches. This is more or less the size of the 4840 - The Burrow, or the Advent Calendars. Back (and sides) The back of the box shows the model on a more neutral background and from another angle. We can see the stickers in place (take a good look at them here, because I did not apply them). The right side we also see a pic of the set from the (3/4) back, and one with a child playing with it. In this latter shot, the model rests upon a nice black box with a Thatcher Perkins sign on it. Unlike the Harley Davidson 1000cc set, the Thatcher Perkins does not have the sign â€˜Designed for experienced LEGO buildersâ€™ for some reason. Contents Inside This set includes a large number of parts, mainly Black, Blue and Red, with some nice Yellow to lighten it up more. Parts of interest The partsâ€™ selection is not exceptional, but weâ€™ll see this set includes some unique pieces which have not been in LEGO sets for long years since the 1980s, like the very nice Black Plate, Modified 1 x 2 with Steam Engine Cylinder, Flat Surfaces, Black Train Wheel Spoked for Motor and the Red Train Steam Drive Rod Holder - Train Steam Drive Rod group. The Wheel Spoked Large, as beautiful as they were, saw the light from the production line for the last time in 1976! The only new mold used in this set is the Black and Blue Slope, Inverted 45 2 x 2 Old Type with Round Bottom Tube. As you can see in the above picture, this locomotive was designed to work (well, be played with) on all kind of surfaces, so the wheels sport tyres. In this picture you can see how they look without the tyres. Of course, builders can use the Thatcher Perkins on their brick-built tracks. Another group of interesting parts are shown in this pic: Red Wheel Spoked 2 x 2 with Stud (and tyre), Black Brick, Modified 2 x 4 with Wheels Holder Old, Clear Bottom and Yellow Minifig, Head (Plain) - Stud Solid. Many newer fans will not be familiar with the last two parts: they were standard fare in a number of sets between the 1960s and early 1990s, but then (unfortunately) they were taken out of production. To be fair, the replacement of the Black Brick, Modified 2 x 4 with Wheels Holder Old, Clear Bottom with the standard technic parts was probably due to the fact that the metal pin used to connect the wheels to these bricks had a shameful tendency at getting off the wheel. Too bad it could not be fixed and these parts kept in production. For those interested, here is a picture of the DSS, courtesy of Peeron. Instructions Cover â€“ As usual, the instructions are not organised in the form of a booklet, but they consist of a folded double printed sheet. The â€˜coverâ€™ shows again the same shot as the front of the box. â€˜Back coverâ€™ â€“ Here we see the name of the set and some additional information, like the year when the first Thatcher Perkins started working (1863) and the type (4-6-0) of this locomotive, which, as shown in the image, is related to the number and position of the wheels. On a side note, the pencil signs on the sides of the sheet were made by my Father while counting the parts in the set. â€˜Random pageâ€™ â€“ As expected, no call-outs here, but the build is pretty straight forward and does not need them. The colours are easy to tell apart. Full page â€“ As you may have noticed, all the building steps are drawn on one side of the â€˜bookletâ€™, making it more properly an instructionsâ€™ sheet. What really makes this â€˜instruction bookletâ€™ stand out in my eyes is the fact that it is indeed a poster: the building steps are all on one side, while the other is a bigger image of the completed set with the name Thatcher Perkins in yellow enclosed in an old styled red tag. Building Start The build starts with the base of the locomotive, putting the 10 wheels in place and strengthening the engine. Notice the use of this â€˜illegalâ€™ technique to build the bumpers. LEGO, as we all know can be a tricky medium to build with, and some details need special solutions to be completed. We then start building the boiler and cabin. Going up fast and steady! In the penultimate step, we build the chimney and cow catcher. Iâ€™d like to spend a few more words on the chimney and how it is attached to the main body. As you can see in the left picture, the 3x3 base of the chimney is asymmetrical, with a 3x2 base on one side and a combination of a 1x2 and a 1x1 plates on the other. In the right picture, you see the top of the main body where the chimney will be attached; it is made of a 1x2 base and 1 1x2 tile. Using another â€˜illegalâ€™ technique (or at least one LEGO designers do not like much nowadays), the holes of the 3x2 plate of the chimney will connect with the studs of the 1x2 plate on the main body, giving a well centred and quite sturdy build. Finished set Front The front of the model sports 3 big headlights, a nice cow catcher and the nicely detailed engine front. I can almost hear it whistle! Side And here it is our good old Thatcher Perkins Locomotive! Indeed, it looks like a classic and powerful engine form one of those Spaghetti Western films, doesnâ€™t it? What I found strange in the beginning is the choice of colours (I was convinced steam engines were all black, at the time). Then I checked some pictures of the original, and I must admit the resemblance is almost perfect! Back The back side is less detailed than the front, with cabin almost devoid of details. I think LEGO could have done a better job on it. 3/4 Front and â€¦ Just see how good it looks from this angle, with all the tubing, moving parts and the lovely 3 headlights! â€¦ 3/4 Back The back view is not as impressive, but grants us a good look at the big posterior wheels and the bumpers. Bonus images Size comparison? As I stated elsewhere, I never understood what scale these Hobby Sets are meant to be. They are clearly not minifig-scale, and they are not technic-fig-scale either. But they are not even Miniland scale! Moreover, they use different scales between locomotives, cars and motorbikes amongst the Hobby Set line! As I said before, the set comes with tyres on the wheels to allow a wider playing experience, not limiting this model to tracks. Nonetheless, builders can assemble their own track (maybe using the vintage blue 4.5V tracks) and make the Thatcher Perkins run its proper environment. Final comments Overall, this is a great set for collectors of old models and steam engines fans, or both. It does not sport a huge variety of bricks, but was a good choice at the time, and even if the result is matter-of-fact a bit blocky when compared to the original, it implements some good solutions to minimise the LEGO brick appearance and maximise the similarity as much as possible. Design & Colour scheme â€“ 8/10 (The design is as accurate as possible, and the colours are completely in line for the Thatcher Perkins Locomotive. The solutions and details included in this set justify the â€˜Expert buildersâ€™ label and add to the appearance, and, why not, playability of the model. Though, I still wish TLG had included more details in the cabin.) Parts - 10/10 (Quite a big selection, but only one new mould. Nonetheless, a good source of Black, Blue and Red standard parts for MOCs and one of the few sources for the extra rare Black Plate, Modified 1 x 2 with Steam Engine Cylinder, Flat Surfaces, Black Train Wheel Spoked for Motor, Red Train Steam Drive Rod Holder - Train Steam Drive Rod group and Wheel Spoked Large.) Playability - 9/10 (A sturdy model which can take some serious play and swoosh-ing without falling apart. The somewhat easily detachable chimney and the lack of an appropriate scale interaction with most other models make it lose one point, though.) Build - 7/10 (Pretty straight forward, with few nice solutions.) Price - 5/10 (Like most older models, especially the Hobby Set and Model Team ones, this set can only rarely be found at reasonable prices. Most of the times, people are asked shameful prices for such a smallish set.) Overall: 8/10 Very good. More pictures can be found in this Brickshelf gallery.

Links: Brickset, Lugnet, Peeron, Bricklink *Note: This set was released under the number 604 outside of the U.S.* Ah, classic Legoland. A time before mini-figs ever existed, and cars and buildings could be made with just a few bricks. The part selection was pretty basic: bricks, plates, slopes, windows and wheels were all you needed to construct an entire town. Heavy machinery could be modeled in 4-wide and be just a few bricks tall. For this review we will be taking a look at the 410 Payloader, one of LEGOâ€™s first sets of a bucket loader. So grab a hard hat, we are heading to the construction yard! Box image courtesy of Bricklink. Box Contents Here we have our instructions which are obviously the older style of LEGO instructions. The steps used much simpler imagery, but they get the job done. They show how to build the Payloader in seven steps. This small set has all of 28 parts in it. The more interesting parts of note are the red digger arm, the bucket, the blue 1X2 brick with arm holes, and the blue 2X2 brick with the classic LEGO logo printed on it. Construction In the first few steps we start building up the base. Then add the arms and start building the cab. Add the bucket, the trailer socket and finish the cab. Throw on some wheels. Completed Set And with that we are finished with our nice small model. Here is the back right side. Notice how the back of the cab was left with an empty spot. Here is the left side. Notice how on the top of the arm they made it so you could just push down on the tips it to make the arm lift instead of having to grab by the arm itself. On the front we have the nice LEGO logo shown to remind the forgetful of what they were playing with. You can also see how much space is in the bucket itself, which can't hold more than a few small plates. Finally on the back we have the trailer socket. This was a nice addition to make it able to tow trailers from other sets like 685. Just donâ€™t try to bring it into your layout populated by mini-figs, they may have a problem trying to get in. Other Thoughts Considering this set is nearly 37 years old, I myself am still surprised by how well the bricks have held up. I purchased this set from a thrift store a year ago for a mere 25 cents. Normally when used LEGO is purchased you can expect to see scratches, marks, wearing, discoloration, etc but boy was I surprised to see how all these parts are in mint condition. Even the instructions still looked like they came from a new box and not all ripped up and tattered. The pieces still connect to each other nice and tight and the metal pieces for the wheels haven't rusted. This just shows that with proper care these things can last a lifetime. I really would like to get a small display case to show it off. Conclusion Playability: 8/10 In addition to the standard of having rolling wheels, you also get a fully movable bucket assembly. With it you can pick up smaller pieces and unload them into a dump truck. Design: 7/10 Like all other Legoland vehicles it has a very basic design, but you can still easily identify what it is. Simple yet effective. Parts: 7/10 Like most other older LEGO sets, all you really get are a few basic bricks and plates. However, you do get a bucket assembly and the 2X2 brick with the classic LEGO logo on it is very cool. It was also nice of LEGO to include the trailer socket so you could tow around your trailers. Price: 8/10 Bricklink's history shows them to sell for around $10 USD used. While that is a bit much for a set this size, it is pretty good considering this set is over 37 years old. However, if you are looking for a new boxed set be prepared to fork over about $50 USD. Overall: 8/10 This small machine would make a nice addition to your collection as a reminder of LEGO's past. So what are your thoughts on this classic set? Edited by TheBrickster, 01 June 2010 - 05:55 AM."

For me, it was in 19*cough*somethingsomething*cough*. We were at her house, and her mother was gone for at least an hour. She slowly unzi... uhhh. Sorry, wrong story. Um, yeahh. Anyway, I do remember my first time. It was 1977, in late summer. Our neighbor, who worked for a department store called Famous-Bahr, said that the main store had a travelling LEGO display. So my family filed into the car and drove into downtown St Louis to see this display. To tell you the truth, I don't remember much about the display itself, but I DO remember that my parents bought me my first LEGO set. Set # 456, the Spirit of St Louis. Set #: 456 (also sold as Set # 661) Name: Spirit of St Louis Theme: LEGOLAND / Large Vehicle Year: 1977 Pieces: 49 Minifigs: 0 Price: $5.00 USD? (Bricklink MISB start @ $175.00 USD, Used Complete ~$35.00 USD) Links: Peeron, Bricklink, Brickset Packaging Box Front: The original box that my set came in was most likely trashed 5 minutes after returning home. This image was lovingly stolen off of the Peeron page for this set. I feel lucky that I even got this much. Similarly, I have no pictures of the plastic baggies the set came in. Truth be told, I can't be sure that there even WERE plastic baggies that the parts came in. THE SET Side View: Well there she is. My first set ever . Actually, I seem to recall the real Spirit of St Louis was silver colored, not Black and Yellow. If you need a history lesson, the Spirit of St Louis was Charles Lindbergh's plane when he made the first trans-Atlantic solo flight. More details can be found on the Wikipedia page. The overall shape is pretty close, at least. The cockpit window could stand to be moved forward one stud, but everything seems to be relatively close. The tail piece isn't the right shape, but it is likely the only tail piece LEGO produced at the time. If you look closely, you can see the various bite marks that my brother and I inflicted over the years. I know some people would be aghast that there are bite marks, but brick separators wouldn't come out for another 10 years. Besides, we were young. We didn't know any better. I certainly had no idea that it would become my obsession. There are some interesting part choices here. Everything is brick and plate built, as you might expect. The same set nowadays would have lots of slope, wedges and wedge plates to round things out. But LEGO was all about the brick in '77, so bricks are what we got. The black inverted slopes worked pretty well asthetically as the wing struts. The wings are simple 4 x 10 plates, nice and square. There were no minifigs in this set. If I remember correctly, 1977 was just about the time when minifigs made their first appearance. I know I have one other set from '77 that does include a minifg, at least. I don't have a lot of comments for the following photos. I'll let the pictures speak for themselves. 3/4 View Back Back 3/4 Top Front PARTS Interesting Pieces I have no idea if there were any extra pieces that came with this set. I kind of doubt it. Instead I took a photo of some of the interesting parts to the model. That translucent white piece didn't photograph so well, but it is a Technic Axle 8. That's right, sets from 1977 contained Technic elements. The two black parts are the forerunners to the 1 x 2 Technic Brick, as well. Everytime I hear someone on the forums complain about Technic elements in system sets, I think back to this set. The round brick is special as well. Here is a closer view of it, complete with bite marks . Round Brick As you can see, the stud is closed. It is only one of two closed stud 1 x 1 Round Bricks that I own. They stopped appearing in sets in 1981, for those that are interested. The DSS You thought you were going to escape this heading, didn't you? Surprise! Yes, even in 1977 LEGO sets had stickers. The oldest printed elements I can remember were in the Classic Space sets that started in 1979. Again, when people in the forums complain about DSS in sets, I can only help think of this set. And chuckle to myself maniacally. The sticker has held up really well considering it's been stuck on the brick for 32 years. No discoloration, very little curling. I think if all stickers held up this well over time, there would be less DSS complaints. THE RATINGS Playability: 6/10 - The set is quite swooshable, and the propellor spins. Outside of that, though... Minifigs: N/A Design: 6/10 - The overall shape is quite good, especially given the era. The color choice leaves a lot to be desired. Price: 1/10 - It's been retired for 30 years. It's going to cost you to get your hands on it. Overall: 13/30 - This set is for true collectors only. I can't imagine anyone wanting one because they want to play with it. It was a great set back in the day, but the design feels REALLY dated. And if you're wondering, mine is NOT for sale. Ever. All the photos, plus more, can be found in the Gallery."

Luckily, the rocket was defective having rather flimsy white bricks that did not stay together well during launch attempts. Lego scrapped its WMD program and the result was this classic ""blue era"" space set known as the Alpha-1 Rocket Base. Instructions: On the backside of the instructions, the set is featured with the Space Command Center, Space Cruiser, and a few vehicle sets: The set includes three figs: And this great rocket fuel tanker: Here's the front section complete with computer: And the rocket fuel section: The set has some interesting features including the Control Section, Fuel Control, and Launch Pad: On top of the Control Section is a nicely design radar/tracking system: Here's the open control room: The Launch Pad and Fuel Control: The Fuel Control includes two sink pieces and blue steering wheels: And Lego's WMD (Weapon of Mass Destruction), the Alpha-1 on the Launch Pad: Here's a shot of the launching mechanism: Unfortunately, I have lost one of the blue sink/faucet pieces as well as a black hose: A close-up of the Alpha-1 Rocket. The white bricks never stayed together well often times coming apart within your hands: The arming and guidance system was nicely designed: A view of the complete set: And another: This is a great set. The base, fuel vehicle, and launch platform offers a great amount of playability. My only complaint is the rocket (as mentioned above). I don't think I ever played with it a sa kid because it always fell apart. Share your comments regarding this Classic Space set."

I know it?s not such a nice review like *yoda* did the last times, but i hope you enjoy some of the pics. First a pic of the complete building: The 3 Minifigs: and i pic of the stairs (one of my highlights at this set): More pics you can find here My opinion about the set: I like this set very much, it was really fun to build it. I?m happy that that i got some more cherries and a croissant now *sweet* , a funny idea is the salad in the one box at the front. i think normally it?s a hairpiece of an exoforce fig. I also like the colours of the house, the dark blue is sooooo nice. I think i have to take more of this soon. The lighter blue is also nice. This set has really nice details like the stairs, or the owl at the entry of the market, or the balcony. I paid 89,99 EUR, a fair price for a really nice set!! Greetings Sandra"

As apo said, the chimneys on top of a garage is kinda weird, there's also a gate, next to another gate which is weird as well... also, if this is supposed to ba a grocery, then the owner has done a lot to hide it. The croissant is nice, but next to the brown box with vegies, there's nothing that suggests this is a shop... 5) the white lamp and the the yellow cylinder are at the same level of the tiles. IMO it should be above the level of the tiles... 6), IMO not worth the 90 euro Edited by snefroe1, 20 June 2007 - 09:03 AM."

I love the mix of colours, it breaks up the model rather than being a single monotone colour. He's used several complimentary colours in order to make up the model. I agree I think the chimneys on the flat roof is weird ontop of the garage, but not so weird one you place it ontop of the building. I guess he's done it to give us the choice of roofs and chimneys. You can always remove the ones you don't like... He also seems to have screwed up a bit on the tiling for the sidewalk on the side module. On Cafe Corner (And the building module of this set) the sidewalk has the pattern light grey 1x6 at the front, then dark grey 1x2 next, then dark grey 2x2's. However on this he's put the 2x2 tiles first then the 1x2's at the back. Easilly fixable though. Overall I love this set, thanks for the pics! Compliments Cafe Corner perfectly."

When I got there, almost all the smaller Castle sets had been sold out, but there was one left: the one I am now reviewing for both Eurobricks and BZPower. ;-) The Box: Well, for starters, the Castle theme boxes are beautiful! The blended clear and stormy skies give a great ?clash of the titans? effect, and the action poses help as well. ;-) The back is equally nice, featuring a photo showing kids how to use the crossbow, and the brave axe wielder taking a swipe at the skeleton (foolish soldier, that won?t work on skellies! See later on in the review to find out why). And of course, we have a small box with the link to the official Lego website, where TLC can advertise even more Lego sets! :P The Contents: After opening the box, a single bag of pieces (with a couple loose ones), the instruction manual and necessary catalog ( :-P ), and a new wider rubber band holder spilt out. The instruction manual is clear as a bell. No color trouble here, folks! Also, it?s worth mentioning the nice background with the mountain and King?s castle silhouettes. :-) Sorry that there's no picture, but I'll take one if someone wants to see it. ;-) The Pieces: For being a 5 dollar set (well, seven in my case. Darn your above average prices, TRU!), Crossbow Attack features a lot of nice pieces (as does the entire Castle lineup). Notable elements include two large brown spoked wheels, two brown modified 1x1?s, a pearl gold slope end, and SIX dark blue modified 1x1x2/3 slopes! The bulk of the pieces, however, are nothing special. I?ll let the picture do the talking for this. The accessories are by far the best parts in this kit. Two different helmets in a beautiful shiny silver are my favorite, but I also really like the scythe (looks good for MOCing) and the round shield ( *wub* ), which are both brand new parts. And can anyone not love the classic axe and crossbows? Oh, and there?s a black lightsaber too, but that?s rather boring compared to the other parts. :-P The Minifigures: Can you say, FOUR figures (including the horse)?! That has to be a record for a regular 5 dollar set, at least in the present age of limited figures per set. We?ll start out with the two Crown militia: a regular soldier and an archer. Both have old faces, but they look spiffy with the shiny helmets and the superb torsos. I?ll name the soldier Bravo the Stout and the archer Angler the Precise, for future references. Now we come to the skellie. Although some people dislike the new skeleton design, I personally prefer it to the old ones, since the arms are now poseable and the face much meaner. The only problem is that the arms hang too low, but it?s not too noticeable when they have weapons in their hands. And last, but not least, here?s the elusive skeleton horse. I for one am very happy that TLC took advantage of that awesome prototype piece and made it into an official mass-production mold. However, the horse is unfortunately one piece, but since regular Lego horses are as well, I don?t have a problem with it. I do have a problem with the pose, however. The legs are in quite an odd position, and I wonder why TLC didn?t make the front and back leg poses symmetrical. Ah well. The Finished Set: I have only two pictures here, since this set is so small. First, here?s the completed crossbow. I must say: FINALLY! No more ridiculous horse mounted catapults or crazy fire wheel launchers! Now we have realistic siege weapons, including the one included with 7090. Plus, it actually launches okay, although not the best. Here?s the other main attraction: the completed skeleton rider and horse. I think it?s rather dramatic with that pose and the dark background, don?t you think? ;-) Playability: Okay, so there?s not much in this set, but a bit of imagination brings plenty of possibilities. To show you what you can do, here?s a little story made only with this set. ;-) Overall Rating: Presentation: 9/10 Pieces: 8/10 Minifigures: 9/10 Finished model: 8/10 Playability: 8/10 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Final Score: 8.4/10 Crossbow Attack is a fine introduction into Castle, so I recommend it to any Lego fan, whether they are a castle nut or just want a cheap change of pace. TLC has a knack with making great small kits these days, and I more than ever support them in their amazing rebound from their dark ages (between 1997 and 2004). ;-) Edited by KimT, 10 August 2008 - 01:33 PM."

About the skellies though (X-D), you have to admit that besides their long arms making the skellie legs look out of proportion, that they're just made poorly. They're sticking straight out, as opposed to every other fig, which have a slight bend to make them look more natural. Also, as I'm sure you've noticed, the pegs are on angles! That makes it impossible for them to hold their weapons straight, and they can't even put their arms over their heads without stressing the plastic some... I mean they're DEAD. Well, at least undead, they're not supposed to be stiff, and personally I like the ragdoll look more, it makes them seem more dead :-P"

It is one of the new style re-closeable boxes rather than the rip the sides style. This set is typical of creator and comes with three sets of instructions. The Monster Dino a kind of spider and a Crocodile The set comes with two of the new motors one small and one large, a sound module plus the new IR controler and receiver. There is a mix of techniques in this set the core is mainly studless technic, there are some studded technic parts and most of the details are standard creator style. There are two mechanisms one to control the legs and one to control the head and arms. The leg drive is from the large motor and the arm and head are operated from the small motor The completed mechanism will stand on its own without any detail added The detail is added to the base unit to complete the model. The operation of the Dino is very good the design for the motors and drives is very compact and well thought out. The walking motion works well although there is no steering and it will fall over it it encounters obstacles. The sound module is built into the head so when the mouth opens the Dino roars (sort of) Glyman made the comment that this set is ugly as sin and I tend to agree I think there are too many colour variations with different shades of grey, black and that lime green :-P which confuses the look of the finished model but I guess it might apeal more to younger kids. I also do not like the spikes along the back, which glow in the dark, because the are loose and keep falling off. This set is not cheap at ?70 but I guess this is because of the motors and IR controller. While on this I was surprised how good the range was on the new controller it would still operate ever when not in direct line of sight. I would give this set a 10/10 for playabilityit has kept the kid amused for hours I would give it 6/10 for value for money it is a bit pricey Overall 8/10 It took approx 3 hours to build and has been well played with I have posted some more images and some videos of the finished models on my brickshelf page HERE If you have any questions please ask Pete Edited by WhiteFang, 23 May 2009 - 06:28 PM.

Regarding the spines, because they're made of the softer non-ABS plastic (the stuff the 1994 cutlasses and brown muskets were made of), they lose their shape a bit and so are hard to grip; they simply fall off. I suppose TLC use loads of different colours because a single or two-colour dino isn't very nice to look at, especially when the surface isn't very smooth - it takes your eyes away from the surface and puts it on the colours. Someone should make an all terrain dino that can walk everywhere from this set - I don't have the skill with technic - I always end up layering and never finish any models. :-("

I have much to say about this little gem. First, let’s cut it straight about the Martians minifigures: they are absolutely rubbish. I can’t imagine how Lego could produce such atrocity. This said; let’s move on to the dropship. A real piece of art. Reminiscent of the Aliens movie dropship. The cockpit is spacious and provides a great field of view, too bad there is no hinges to open it, you must remove the canopy completely to switch pilot. The drilling unit can be attached under the ship with the clever use of a rubber piece. It stays well in place once attached, good point. Some people don’t like the inclusion of the 2 containment area for the Martians and crystal on both side of the ship but I kind like it, it makes the ship less empty. The 2 wings are complete with air intake, some armaments and 1 standard launcher on the right wing. Normally I don’t like launchers but this one is very discrete and well integrated. On the tail section are 2 thrusters that can be rotated and provide thus some “realistic” movements to the ship. One of the last highlight of this ship is the landing gears, or I must say landing dishes. 6 medium sized radar dishes provide and incredible stability to the set. They are quite sturdy and can take a beating. I’m not going to review the alien spaceship in detail since it’s quite uninteresting. I consider it more like a bonus addition to the set than anything else. The look is passable and there are some interesting building techniques in it. That’s all. To end the review, a little pros/cons table. (We all love pros/cons table :-) ) Pros: - Incredible design - At last a decent space set - Modular functions - Quite Sturdy - Beautiful - Great value for money Cons: - Martians are rubbish - No hinges for the canopy - The drilling unit could use some more details. Score: 9/10 By the way , I added a nice cool feature on my site , you can download the stickers for some sets that I own. Before building I always scan the stickers, we never know it could come handy. check this out on my site (you need to go in the Lego lists on the left): [VTX] Classic games"

Sorry for being redundant but it is already written so here ya go: Monster Dino Reviewed by Dunamis Set 4958 792 Pieces $89.95 from LEGO Online Store Build time 3.5 hours Here we go with another offering from the Creator line. I?m kind of fond of these sets as they are pretty imaginative and usually have instructions for multiple models. I like the reusability of all the pieces and the varied things you can build. The Box: The box that LEGO shipped this thing in was absolutely huge! When I first got this in the mail, I thought I had won the lottery and they had shipped the UCS Falcon early. Once I opened the shipping box, I was surprised to see an unusually large Creator set box. The box itself is pretty standard Creator type box but this one shows off the Power Functions prominently on the right side of the box. The back of the box shows some of the motorized features as well. Opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals. We?re back to the reusable cereal box type tab system for those of you who stay up a night wondering about LEGO?s next box design. Inside the box we have a bunch of sealed bags. Immediately the power brick, remote and motors stand out as they are each in individual bags. Also, there are three manuals. The Manuals: The three manuals are 76, 76 and 56 pages in length. They are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings: - Piece call outs for each step - Parts inventory at the end of the primary model build - Page numbers Color separation in these manuals were fine for me. Interestingly, the instructions for the primary build took a full manual plus about a quarter of another manual. Random manual photos: Parts list I?ll explain a bit more below, but it would have been nice to have some written documentation on all the functions of the motors, remote and receiver. Such as motor load guidelines and specific explanations of all the remote control functions. It is severely lacking in this area. The Pieces: Obviously, the pieces we?re most interested in are these new motors and wireless remote control. Note that before you fire this bad boy up, you had better BYOB. Since this is prominently a European community, I had better clarify my acronyms. Over here across the pond, BYOB usually means ?Bring Your Own Beer?. In this case, it still means bring your own beer (I?m on my second Heineken right now) but in addition to numerous bottles of beer you will need a total of NINE batteries to get through this set. I kid you not: Anyway, there are two motors (a small and a large) each with its own very unique name according to the manual; the smaller one is called ?motor? and the larger one is called ?XL motor?. Very creative indeed! The battery box takes SIX AA batteries and there are two compartments to hold them. Here is the first: That seems pretty normal. However, the back side of it holds the other three batteries and it seems to be very poorly designed: Note in the photo above where the bottom battery is placed. Compare it to the previous photo and you will see the difference. I played around with trying to get that bottom battery out and you better pack a lunch (or BYOB) because it is no small task! Why couldn?t they make this compartment just like the other side? There is a single power cord connector and a three position switch. The middle position turns the power OFF and the other two positions seem to provide the same functionality in either position as far as I can tell. Perhaps a little blurb in the manual would have been nice to clear things up a bit. The remote takes three AAA batteries. It is fairly small and lightweight even with the batteries installed. It has two thumb controls which could be levers if you insert Technic bars or even pins. The two controls are color coded and match the plugs on the receiver to control two separate motors. In addition, there is a four position switch which I assume changes the channel. Finally, there are two tiny levers that seem to have no function. I?m not sure if they are a trim control or variable speed control. I messed with them and didn?t notice any difference in the motor speed. Again, some documentation from the incredibly verbose LEGO manual would have helped. As far as the rest of the parts, it?s really a mixed bag. There are a lot of varied parts in this set to the point that there is almost one of everything. Lots of Technic gears, pins, studded beams, studless beams, axles, wheels, etc. Also, lots of little 1x1 slopes in various colors, teeth, horns, etc. You can?t really say it is a parts pack because there is not enough of one thing to make it a parts pack. A couple of notes: It seems the quality control issue on the axles has been fixed. I initially reported this back when I reviewed the 8285 about a year ago. All the axles worked fine for me. The color quality control issue is still alive. Check out the different shade of red in these two parts: Also included is the sound brick. This looks just like the other sound or light-up bricks we have been seeing lately. It does have a load dinosaur ?roar!? sound embedded in it though so hide the younglings if they are a bit on the skittish side. Finally, I?ve never seen one of these before (although someone will no doubt rattle off a dozen sets where you can find this part in about 5 seconds): No, I am not referring to the studded beam, I put that in the photo for scale. The Build: The build was fun and was fairly straightforward. As I mentioned, there is a lot of Technic parts, so if you are not a fan of the Technic line you should run, not walk away from this one. There were no gotchas to speak of, but you need to pay careful attention to the placement of the wires that go from the motors to the receiver. They kind of sneak them around a bit so watch closely. Otherwise, it was fine. Here is what is left over: So far, I have only built the primary model. As seen on the box, there are instructions for two more models. Both of the other models seem less complex than the primary model and are likely quicker builds. The Dino took me about 3.5 hours which included some time to screw around with the motors. I?m an old school Technic fan from way back in the 80?s so I had some familiarity with the old Technic motors. Obviously, 25+ years has improved some things and these seem much more powerful. The Design: If you have built the 4507 Prehistoric Creatures then some of the design will feel familiar, especially the head and tail. It is almost like they took the dinosaur from that set and figured out how to motorize it. This is not necessarily a bad thing, just a comment. The set does a good job of showing off the features of the new motors and remote. It is nice to see how one motor can perform multiple functions. In this case, the small motor makes both arms move and opens and closes the mouth of the dinosaur. When the mouth is completely open, it pushes the activation switch on the sound brick which emits the ?roar!? sound. Pretty cool. The ?XL Motor? handles the walking feature of the dinosaur. There is both forward and reverse. Forward works really well while the reverse just makes the dinosaur look like he is doing a Michael Jackson moon walk. (Wow, I never thought I would use Michael Jackson?s name in a LEGO Dinosaur set review!) It is almost like the dinosaur can?t get traction going in reverse. However, as noted previously forward works really well. This guy actually gets going at a pretty good clip. As you might expect, he kind of waddles like a duck since there is no articulation in the knees. It is a bit awkward but it works. The ?XL Motor? seems to kick out plenty of power. Overall, the design seems to be a mixed bag. The way the tail is attached seems to be an afterthought. The arms look to be too small. However, the walking mechanism and legs/feet are pretty cool as well as the head and mouth. I guess it is a reasonable effort to get people introduced to the parts and we?ll see designs improve as time goes on. Here are a few views of our new friend: But What About The AT-AT??? Of course, the real reason you are reading this is that you hope I will have some epiphany on how all this relates to the new walking AT-AT. Judging from the box on the AT-AT, it looks like we get one motor. I don?t see the remote which is a disappointment as I hope it is not controlled by a switch on the body and you either turn the AT-AT on or off. If that is the case, the first thing I am doing is scavenging the receiver and remote from this set to add to the AT-AT. Granted, it could be that it comes with a remote but is just not seen on the box. Also, the AT-AT box looks like one of the images shows that the head turns. I sure hope this is controlled separately as it would be really lame to not be able to control this independently from the walking feature. I?m kind of skeptical on the walking feature of the AT-AT. I suspect it will be rather cumbersome but hopefully I will be pleasantly surprised. Needless to say, this is all speculation but those are my initial thoughts based on this set. Overall Thoughts: It?s an OK set. Kind of pricy but I suspect a large part of that is due to the motors and remote. I haven?t built the other two models (they seem less interesting to me) but at least it has some variability. Also, you get a ton of different parts which can either be a good thing or bad thing depending on what you are looking for. The dinosaur is average. The color selection is marginal (black and lime green?) and the tail section is just lame. I appreciate it more for the mechanical functions and how the motorized parts work. It does do a good job of waking up my dog who seems pretty irritated by it. It is a nice set to show off to the neighbors or the endless caravan of my wife?s friends that seem to materialize out of nowhere. People are quickly impressed by it and then promptly move along once you start trying to explain how it all works. I?m a bit disappointed that the manual did not explain more about the remote and motor functions. I suspect that there is more than meets the eye and I?ll just have to play around with it to find out. It would be nice if LEGO had a website that showed all the cool functions of the motors and remotes so we fully understand the capabilities. Final Rating: 72% Build 9/10 (Pretty quick and fun. The mechanical part is cool) Functionality 6/10 (It is a Creator set so you have multiple builds. As far as it being a dinosaur, it?s just OK. Motorized parts are cool though.) Design 6/10 (Partly cloudy. Some things are cool, others are lame.) Parts 8/10 (New motors and remote are cool. Lots of varied parts included but nothing to write home about.) Price 7/10 (It is kind of expensive) Edited by WhiteFang, 23 May 2009 - 06:23 PM. Indexed"

There is a quite a number of parts in Power miner lime green and 1x1 white teeth plate for the mouth and claws. The dino alone has 20 teeth in its mouth The glow in the dark ""antennas"" on the backbone of the dino is a nice touch as you can let him walk in the dark somewhat. I do agree with the reviewer, the box IS INSANELY HUGE!!! I don't think Lego wanted to show a 1:1 scale dino, they just wanted to promote the power function stuff as large as possible.

Of course we get an extra stormtrooper: 75083 AT-DP Minifigs by whitesidewjw, on Flickr No new molds in this as far as I can tell, however these printed 4X4 domes are really great.

I like the two AT-DP Pilots and Agent Kallus is a well done minifig. I can complain about another storm trooper either Parts- 3/5- Other than the dome pieces I commented on before, there is really not any new parts in this. If you build space, star wars, or machinery, this will still be a welcome assortment. Experience of Build 4/5- This really was a fun build. It came together fast but was challenging enough for its target age group. Playability 5/5- This thing is much more sturdy than it looks. The legs take a little bit of effort due to the double locking hinges but hold together very well.This is a very minor complaint. Value 4/5- Typical- $49.99 for 500 pieces- I must admit I paid a little more than MSRP due to shipping but I can't complain about the value. Overall: 21/25- I really believe this is one of the best walkers that Lego has designed. The only changes I would make would be adding real control panels in the cockpit and it would be nice if lego made a real widow to fit in with these types of builds rather than a transparent tile over another plate. All in all, I would recommend this set and I hope the rest of the 2015 Star Wars sets are on par with this."

I don't know much about the rebals show at all, but I can say that the over all design of the walker really appeals to me and the minifigs look top notch.

I'm a big fan of this set, the minifigures are good, as is the parts selection. I like the piece used in the cockpit to secure the minifigure in place.

This looks pretty great, I probably won't be getting it due to budget constraints. (Bionicle) but still, very nice set.

It may seem all happy and colorful at first glance, but if you've lived there as long as I have, you'd know that it's a dirty cesspool of crime and corruption. It seems like there is a bank robbery, jail break, or fire every day. The police refuses to use guns and seems to be more concerned about getting haircuts than fighting crime, so they're not really helping. And ever since candy got outlawed, several smuggling circles have cropped up all over town. This city has gone to the dogs, and that's why I decided to become a private eye, to solve the crimes that the bumbling police force can't. It was a cold afternoon. I was sitting in my office, lost in thought. Only a few rays of light entered through the windows into the dark and dusty room. There were various letters and documents scattered across my desk. I was working on a case that I had been working on for months. I was trying to find a criminal who had been eluding authorities for a while. The wanted poster hung on the wall behind me, but the description on it was very vague and since everyone has the exact same face and body type in Lego City, it was nearly impossible to find him. I was getting hungry, so I reached into my own secret stash of cookies and started eating one. ""Who could outlaw something that tastes so good,"" I thought to myself. In that moment, there was a knock on the door. I quickly hid the cookie under the desk and said: ""Come in."" The door slowly opened and a woman in a red dress and long, wavy hair entered the room. The dim light from the window glistened on her smooth yellow skin. She had a big smile on her face, but by the look in her dark, round eyes, I could tell that she was troubled. ""Are... are you Oky Brickman, the private detective?"" she asked hesitantly. ""Yes, I am, ma'am,"" I responded, ""please, have a seat."" The woman in red closed the door behind her, walked across the room, and sat down in the chair in front of me. There was a moment of silence, then I said: ""So, what can I do for ya?"" She paused as if to think about how best to start, then replied: ""Well, you see... There is a new Lego set coming out soon, 10246 Detective's Office, the 10th addition to the modular buildings series, and I am very interested to get it, but I am not sure if it lives up to the standard of the other modular buildings. So, I was wondering if you could review it for me and find out if it's worth the price."" I was perplexed. This was not what I was expecting to hear, but I was intrigued. ""I see,"" I said slowly, ""that is quite a tough situation you're in."" I paused dramatically, then I said, ""Alright, I'll do it."" ""Oh thank you, Mr. Brickman! I will see to it that you get a copy of the set and will reward you handsomely if you succeed."" She got up and left, and sure enough, one week later I received a package at my doorstep with the Lego logo on it... Set Number: 10246 Name: Detective's Office Theme: Advanced Models Subtheme: Modular Buildings Year of Release: 2015 Pieces: 2262 Minifigures: 6 Price: $159.99 USD S@H description: Quote Discover hidden clues and surprises at the Detective’s Office! Discover a world of mystery and adventure with the LEGO® Creator Expert Detective’s Office! Step through the open archway and into the barbershop, where seated customers are pampered in the reflection of a large wall mirror, while next door, competitors play pool and darts beneath the comforting whir of a rotating ceiling fan. Venture to the first floor and you’ll find the detective’s office, his desk strewn with clues, a safe containing valuable evidence and a concealed wall compartment. Then visit the adjacent bathroom, featuring a classic pull-chain toilet, before taking the stairway to the well-equipped kitchen, from where you can access the roof terrace, complete with large water tower. This latest addition to the LEGO Modular Building series is packed with unsurpassed detail and hidden surprises. Easy-to-remove roof and ceilings provide access to the delightful interior, while the exterior of the building features a decorative roofline and a beautifully designed façade. Can you solve the smuggling mystery? Includes 6 minifigures with assorted accessories: Detective Ace Brickman, Al the barber, dart player, pool player, police woman and a mysterious lady in red. S@H Bricklink Brickset Box The box is about the same size as the other modulars, but it has a slightly new design. Note the new five-brick ""Expert"" logo in the top right corner as well as the three small images underneath it showing the back of the building, its sections, and its width. These are quite useful for seeing more views of the set without having to look on the back of the box, although they do take away some of the space for the box art. Like with the Parisian Restaurant, there are several small close-ups of the set on the back as well as a large picture with the Detectives Office displayed next to the last two modulars. I especially like the pictures of the pool room and the rooftop where Ace Brickman is peeking around the corner to spy on people. The rooftop picture is particularly humorous as it seems that Ace has climbed on the outside of the railing in order not to be seen. This detective will apparently do anything to solve a mystery, no matter the risk! This modular building is unique in that there is an actual story going. This set is set in the prohibition era, but since TLG doesn't want to promote alcohol, they replaced booze with candy, which is a pretty clever idea, even if a bit unnecessary considering this set is aimed at adults. I recommend watching the designer video for this set to learn more about the story from the designer himself. The top of the box features a parts inventory and a 1:1 picture showing the newspaper vending machine for scale. On the bottom of the box, there is just a small version of the picture from the front of the box, a Lego Club ad, and the usual fine print. Nothing interesting here. As you can see, the right side of the box I received got a bit damaged on the way from Denmark unfortunately, but it's not too bad. Here you can see a picture of all the minifigs with various accessories. Quite a nice little scene that shows you what items are included in the set. On the other side, there is yet another instance of the box art with the name of the set in six different languages. It's interesting to know that the word ""detective"" is more or less the same in most languages. Contents Inside the box there are 18 bags of varying sizes, each numbered 1, 2, 3, or 4, with the larger bags having more, smaller bags inside of them. That's a lot of bags! The fact that all these pieces are split into only four sections is what makes this an advanced build, I assume. Unfortunately, the box wasn't the only thing that was damaged. The large bag with the number 2 and one of the small bags inside of it had a small rip right across the middle of them, so there were three loose pieces inside the box. Fortunately, nothing was missing, but it is disconcerting nonetheless and I hope this is an isolated incident. How this happened is a mystery that only a detective like Ace Brickman could solve. Also included in the box are the instruction booklet, an dark gray 8x16 plate, and a 32x32 baseplate in reddish brown which is the first appearance of this part in that color. That's right, no stickers! Following the example set by the Parisian Restaurant, all decals in this set are printed! Let's hope they continue this trend in future modulars. Here is a picture of a random instructions page. The part call-outs usually feature several different pieces at a time. There is a new feature where all the parts that are added during each step are outlined in red. Some may say that this makes the build less challenging, but I think it is quite helpful on such a large and complex model. I hope they use this feature in future sets, at least the big ones. Minifigures There are six minifigures in this set, all with the classic smiley head. First, there is Ace Brickman the detective. He comes with a fedora and a magnifying glass. His torso is J. Jonah Jameson's with yellow hands. Then there is Al the barber. Him and Ace are the first two named characters in the modular building series! He comes with the new scissors which also appear in some 2015 Friends and Elves sets. We have seen his torso in other D2C sets before, such as the Palace Cinema and Fairground, but they suit him very well. Next, there are the dart player and pool player. The dart player comes with a red baseball cap and cleverly uses Indian feathers as darts, while the pool player uses a 4L bar as a pool cue. Then there's the female cop who comes with her police hat. She uses the same torso as Ma Cop. I like to think that this is Ma Cop when she was young. And then there is the woman in red who doesn't really come with an accessory. As you can see, only half of them have back printing, and very minimal ones at that, but that's ok. Build The first section of the build focuses entirely on constructing the pool hall which is apparently called ""The Highlander"", so there are a lot of tan, gray, brown, and green pieces. This set is clearly inspired by film noir movies (hence my intro story), so it makes sense to start with one of the most common settings of that genre. Here are some of the notable pieces from these bags. We get two 4x4 domes in dark green and one of those little clip pieces in pearl gold. There are also a few printed pieces such as the two windows with the name of the pool hall, a new dart board, and one of those 2x2 tiles with a red star and a golden brick on it which appeared previously in the Palace Cinema (and an exclusive Legoland set). There is also a new round tile in white with a stud in the middle. There are two of these pieces in this set, both of which are used as table cloths, and they will undoubtedly be useful for sets and MOCs in the future. At step 6 of the build, most of the sidewalk and pool hall floor is finished. The mix of dark colors for the floor looks great and I like how they included dispersed studs among the tiles so that you can position minifigures around the room. Or maybe they just didn't want to include any dark tan tiles other than 1x2s and 1x6s. Ten steps later, the pool table, dart board, and trophy cabinet are constructed. The pool table is not quite as good as some MOCs I have seen, but I do like the SNOT technique they used and it looks decent enough. At the end of section 1, the pool hall is complete. Please ignore my building mistake on the awnings. I only realized after taking this picture that they should be built one stud more outward. This is the first time the Mixels joints have been used as decorative elements and they work quite well. Unfortunately, this is just a pool hall and not a pub, so there is no bar which is a shame, but I guess it makes sense with the whole no-alcohol thing. Some minifigures might be upset about this though. The bags with the number 2 contain the rest of the pieces for the ground floor. There are lots of nice dark blue bricks along with some gray, white, and black parts. You get two cookie and three swirly mint tiles in these bags which have appeared in Seasonal and Friends/Princess sets before. There are also three of those cupcake tops in dark pearl silver and a fez in white which are rare in these colors. I was happy to see that you get three of the new scissors piece in this set! The white rectangle on the right is the new mirror element. It's on a sturdy cardboard and has protective sticker. Now we begin constructing the barbershop. At step 31, the tiling is finished, and you can already see the barrel of candy hidden under the stairs. A few steps later, the interior of the barber shop is taking shape. There is a cabinet, a sink, an old-school barbers chair, and two manikin heads with different hair styles on them. Now we know where Luke Skywalker and Doc Ock get their hair done! By step 45, most of the barbershop is done, and it seems that young Ma Cop couldn't wait her hair done. I don't blame here; after all, this is the first Lego barbershop we've ever gotten! And as you can see in this picture, the mirror is fully reflective. It's not a sticker, so it just held in place by those grooved plates. It's the best mirror that we've ever gotten in a set and I'm sure mirrors like this would be very popular in other sets, especially ones aimed at girls. At step 57, the ground floor is nearly finished. Only a few objects are missing on the side walk which will be added later. After this section, the step numbering starts over at 1 for some reason. The barbershop looks great, especially the cleverly constructed sign with the scissors and the brick-built lettering. The little bench and the barber's pole are nice details as well, even though the stripes on the latter are horizontal instead of diagonal. On the back, there is a grate with some foliage and a trash can. Also, a partial roof has been added to the pool hall which is separately removable. In the bags for section 3, there are tons of great nougat-colored brick-bricks and bricks in two shades of light blue. If you're a collector of rare bricks, this is worth getting the set for right here. There are also several printed pieces here. There is the window with the Ace Brickman writing, a wanted poster which is so humorously vague that it could be about pretty much any minifigure, the usual Lego newspaper which is apparently still running the story about ""the greatest LEGO hero ever"", a street level map which first appeared in Shredder's Dragon Bike set (which is fitting since the map in that set depicted a part of New York City, which could very well be the location of the Detectives Office as well), a painting with a sail ship, a $100 bill, and several letters, one of which is the old-school kind with a heart stamp. We also get the paint roller handle in black for the first time and an unprinted white R5 head. The second half of the build begins with the floor for the 1st floor. Then you start constructing the staircase and bathroom. The R5 head is used as the toilet bowl. As C-3PO would say: ""How perverse!"" At step 28, the bathroom and hallway section of the building are finished. The paint roller handles have been cleverly used as curved lamp posts. Now we finally get to the most important part of The Detective's Office - the actual detective's office! At step 32, most of the furniture has been constructed, including a messy desk, a file cabinet, a safe, a coat hanger, and two chairs. There is also a flower pot on the fire escape balcony with three differently colored flowers. At the end of this section, the first floor is complete, minus the Pool sign which will be added at the end of the build. The detective's office looks great. It looks just like something out of a film noir flick or something like Who Framed Roger Rabbit. The back is a bit plain, but there are still a few details to keep it interesting such as the flowers on the window sill. Then we add it to the building and the build is 3/4 complete. The last few bags contain the pieces for the kitchen, rooftop, and anything else that's still missing. Most of the parts are gray, but we also get a few more of those nice light blue bricks. We get three more newspapers and cookies in this section, as well as a printed clock. Also included are the 2x2 L-tile and round tile with center hole in red which are used for the letters on the Pool sign. There is also an inverted 2x2 dome in red and two more unprinted R5 heads, one in orange brown, and another one in white. The most unusual parts here, however, are four dark gray Unikitty tails and that stud with a hole that usually holds her horn in black. Don't worry, no Unikitties were harmed in the making of this building. With the new red tiles, you can spell all kinds of words! Mostly silly ones though. The build of this floor starts out very similar to the last one, except this one has an extra hole for the skylight. The numbering of the building steps resets again. I guess they wanted to have separate sets of steps for each floor. At step 15, most of the interior of the kitchen is done and the cat is already after those cookies! It's interesting to note that the banister of the staircase is built the same way as the one on the first floor. Nice consistency there. Four steps further into the build, the blue part of the walls is finished and topped off by a bunch of gray jumper plates. The rest of the walls is built at a half-stud offset to create the protruding arches. At step 30, the kitchen is done and the construction of the detective office's rooftop begins. Ten steps later, the third floor is finished. There is a very clever use of Hero Factory hands as roofline decorations. Once again there are flowers on the window sill on the back, and it's nice to see the watertower is brick-built using tank treads. Next, you build the roof of the kitchen. This is a fairly simple and quick build, although is still some neat SNOT building going on with the Unikitty tails. When we add them all together, we are almost done! It's already looking quite impressive. Once we add the Pool sign, newspaper vending machine, the tree, and the lamp post, the set is finally complete. And what a fine set it is! Like all modulars, the building stands quite tall and is gorgeous to look at from most angles. Looking at it from the front, there are many great details to look at. It definitely looks like the type of building you would see in one of the large American cities such as New York or Los Angeles which are typically the setting for detective stories. All the different colors make it look fun, but still realistic and aesthetically pleasing. The left side of the building, however, is admittedly not that nice to look at. there are two gray and two black spots on the wall that stick out like a sore thumb, but are necessary for the interior. However, if you connect this building to one of the other modular buildings, I suppose you won't see them anyway. The back of the building looks nice and colorful like the front. I especially like how the profile bricks add some nice texture to the walls of the hallways and detective's office. The right side of the building looks a bit better than the other side, even though there are some white, gray and black spots here too, but those can just be chalked up to flaking paint. Spare Parts After the build, there are quite a few pieces left over, mainly the usual bits and bops, plus the obligatory brick separator. Play Features Since there is a story being told, there are lots of play features in this set. It begins in the kitchen where the smugglers make the candy. There is an oven with a stove, a rolling pin, and a cupboard with a pot. The only problem is that the rolling pin is much too big for the small 2x2 tables in the kitchen, but oh well. Then, they can bring the barrel with the candy down to the back alley where they can open the grate with the foliage and push it into the barbershop. By the way, the instructions tell you to put the red hat into the trash can here, so perhaps this is meant to be a clue for the detective to find. In the barbershop, the stairs can be lifted up to play inside. Here, Al can open the secret passage behind his cabinet, take in the candy barrel, and open another little secret door under the stairs to move the candy to the pool hall. The stairs in the little alleyway between the barbershop and pool hall can be removed in order to easily move the barrel from one room to the other or to simply hide it there. Lastly, the minifigs in the pool hall can slide the black board under the trophy cabinet aside thanks to a clever SNOT technique and bring the candy inside through the secret hole. Brilliant! On the other side of the pool hall there are clips for holding the cues and darts. There is also a well constructed ceiling fan that uses snowshoes for blades and can swing to the side to access the interior. I really like the rooftop as well. It looks just like the type of rooftop you'd see on a building in New York or some other big city. In fact, I could easily picture some of the superheroes from NYC leaping across it, like Spider-Man or the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, so this set has some re-usability in those themes. The skylight can be fairly easily removed to look inside the detective's office. This is where the smugglers check to see if Ace is in his office or not. The newspaper vending machine can be opened to take one newspaper out. There is another one in there, but it's stuck to the back of the machine. The detective's office itself is not without play features either. There is a secret hiding spot behind the painting which can be swung to the side to reveal it. On the other side of the room, there is a coat hanger for Ace to hang his hat on and a safe to hide money in. There is also a fire escape ladder on the side of Ace Brickman's office which can be lowered by pulling a tab that holds it in place, but it only reaches down halfway and makes it impossible for anyone on the second floor to climb down when it's lowered. Not the best design, but I appreciate the attempt. In the hallway outside of Ace's office, there is a potted plant. Not really a play feature, just a neat little detail in my opinion. The bathroom is confined to a 3x4 studs space and isn't even fully enclosed, but they managed to cram a lot of details in there. Aside from the pull-chain toilet, there is also a roll of toilet paper and even a tiny sink. That's about it. Now that I have fully examined this set, it's time to write my report for the woman in red. Ratings Design: 5/5 - The building looks absolutely fantastic. It is very reminiscent of those old detective movies as it has many of the typical elements from those films. The colors are fun, but still somewhat realistic, and the walls have a nice texture to them. There are lots of clever details all over this set. Build: 5/5 - The building is so asymmetrical that the build never gets repetitive. There are some uncommon techniques and the fact that the bags are split into only four groups makes it challenging. And the new red outline for newly added pieces in the instructions are helpful. I had a lot of fun building this. Minifigs: 4/5 - The minifigures are nothing all that special, but that's to be expected. They do come with some rare torsos and hairpieces and there is a relatively high number of them, so as far as minifigures in modular buildings go, they are pretty good. Playability: 5/5 - This set has more play features than any of the previous modulars. I love the fact that they came up with a story for this set and designed the building and play features around it. This set has so many hidden compartments and moving stairs that it could rival any Hogwarts castle! Parts: 5/5 - Like every modular, this set has many bricks in new and/or rare colors such as light blue. It also has a brown baseplate, lots of those brick-bricks, and even some new molds like the scissors and that 2x2 round tile with only one stud. Plus all of the decals are printed! Price: 4/5 - 2262 pieces seems a bit low for the price considering the Parisian Restaurant had over 200 pieces more, but I'd still say it's a fair price for a model of this size. Overall: 5/5 - This is my first modular building, so I can't really compare it to any of the nine that came before it, but on its own it's great in my opinion. In fact, it made me want to start collecting this series. I would recommend anyone to add this to their collection right away, whether you already have the other modular buildings or are a newcomer to this line like me, especially if you are a fan of mysteries. So there you have it. I hope you enjoyed this special Academy review as much as I had fun making it. Big thanks to Lego and the EB ambassadors for giving me this opportunity. The Detective's Office is now available at S@H and Lego Brand Stores, so go and get your copy today! By the way, Homer Simpson is not the only minifigure who is upset about the pool hall..."

This review has greatly changed my view on this modular. A definite buy for me. Love the interiors and the whole concept.

I think the first one was released in 1981, more than 25 years ago. This year, Lego added another one to the family, Mars Mission's ""Rhino 1"", as its title sounds... It's been a while since i've bought and opened a large box, so maybe this isn't a surprise to most of you, but the box does not open at the front, as with many larger sw boxes, but at the side. The two printed seals(or whatever people call them) have gone as well, being replaced by one larger print in the middle of side... the box also isn't as thick as a large sw box, like the sandcrawler... The general size is, however, still quite large. PICT0001.JPG 281.91K 102 downloads the back side shows the Mars Mission theme sets... eccept the Rhino! I guess it shows this set will be released as a TRU exclusive or something, only to show up in Legoland shops and maybe Lego shops... It's a shame really, because this is by far the best set of the theme. PICT0002.JPG 285.42K 89 downloads When you open the front cover, you see a larger picture picture of the Rhino. Obviously, it seems to be some sort of multifunctional truck. i think the basic function is to drive around and explore. For that it has a drilling device and six giant wheels. PICT0003.JPG 273.7K 82 downloads The set comes with two instruction books. i'm afraid to say they did not resolve the gray/black colors issue. Colorwise, the real thing does not look like the instruction book because of it... PICT0004.JPG 302.63K 75 downloads The Rhino looks really big because of the six giant wheels. I guess it's more or less the same size as M-tron's Magnetiser with the big difference between the two being that the wheels have been turned around, creating a unique wheel design for a Lego model PICT0285.JPG 290.59K 83 downloads PICT0277.JPG 286.26K 80 downloads the wheels look very cool, even though the first couple of wheels stand a bit closer to each other. Don't know why that is. hm... |-/ and they could have used a bit more body, but the design is pretty good. i know, ""Armagheddon"" isn't far away... |-/ PICT0292.JPG 216.75K 70 downloads The suspension of the wheels is a bit flimsy. sure, it allows the truck to move around in a more realistic way than the old sets, but it's not as flexible as some older sets, like sw's CTT. Nor do the wheels have much body. the black bars you see on top of the wheels are more ""window dressing"" then functional... PICT0293.JPG 244.78K 88 downloads The over all shape of the Rhino is kinda ""bulky"", it looks more like a beatle than a rhino, if you're asking me. It has three major sections, but i wouldn't call it a modular building though... The cockpit is the first section. It's spacious and detailed. PICT0290.JPG 262.77K 0 downloads PICT0291.JPG 299.75K 87 downloads The cockpit hangs down from a weird angle. it's attached to a large vertical technic brick that is part of the Rhino's main structure, so it's not a seperate spaceship, which is a shame... oh well... you can't have it all, i guess... PICT0301.JPG 291.13K 78 downloads ah yes... stickers all over the place, but they're cool. the mid section of the Rhino dominates the basic shape of the model. It's as if those two large white parts form a strong and thick shield, protecting whatever is inside from whatever is outsde. PICT0007.JPG 213.22K 67 downloads unfortunately, there is nothing inside. it's extra space needed to house the spaceship. That's really a shame; a command center of some kind could have given the rhino a bit more ""panache"". PICT0286.JPG 251.35K 87 downloads However, what's really great, is the way in which they fit together: one side has an orange 1x2 plate that fits in between two white 1x3 plates of the other side, creating yet another unique shape for a Lego model. But again, it's a shame they didn't do more with this section... X-O PICT0283.JPG 287.75K 82 downloads The third and last section is a platform for a space ship. PICT0299.JPG 289.5K 77 downloads PICT0287.JPG 199.78K 75 downloads The platform itself isn't really special. no details, no stickers,... it's just a skeleton to carry the spaceship, nothing more nothing less. No, your space ship doesn't fall off, even if you rotate the platform into a launch position, pushing the weight of the ship backwards. In fact, the position of the ship onto the platform is so solid, it's kinda difficult to imagine how this ship flies off. |-/ The ship on the other hand, is pretty cool. It's all sorts of things at the same time it seems. It transports two aliens, but also a small car that reminds me of the small sets of Spacepolice 2, blacktron 2,... PICT0295.JPG 307.4K 85 downloads PICT0298.JPG 268.13K 75 downloads PICT0294.JPG 276.84K 76 downloads the shuttle reminds me of a Star trek shuttle and i think it needs some modding, but i do think it looks pretty nice. sure, the cockpit is a bit too low, a pilot needs to lay down instead of sitting down and the dropping mechnism, if there is one at all isn't all that brilliant either... The main structure is a bit too technical for me. I prefer actual parts with studs, not these Lego technic bars and pins. PICT0006.JPG 224.43K 74 downloads the crew: PICT0276.JPG 239.43K 70 downloads ah yes, there's also this green plastic residu. think they are supposed to be the aliens... and there's also this weird alien craft, but i didn't bother to build that... *sad* GOOD: *wub* Great, innovative design, lots of potential, i even like the colors *sweet* Lots of playability it's a big, attractive model; i don't see any weak spots in the design that could compromise stability or structural integrity. NOT SO GOOD: |-/ too many technic parts, some sections on the model, like the gun and the drilling device are a bit to flimsy I'd say 7.5-8.5/10 Price: 750 Danish Crowns, about 105euro"

However, I'm VERY surprised by the size. It's a $40 set and comes in a small Friends-style box (roughly 12""x12"" size) - I almost didn't see it on the shelf when I was looking for it because it's so small. I mean, I know it's only $40 but it's a friggin' CASTLE. And why did Lego only make this a smaller set? If they'd made a $200 Frozen castle they still would have sold every one they could produce. They made big Harry Potter Hogwarts sets and those sure sold. And have you SEEN the toys in the Frozen section of stores? HUGE playsets for Barbie-sized dolls. But I suppose I'm getting the cart before the horse here, reviewing before I've even opened the box. So..... Name: Elsa's Sparkling Ice Castle Set Number: 41062 Pieces: 292 Price: $39.99 Minifigs: 3 Theme: Disney Princess Year of Release: 2015 Links: Bricklink Peeron Brickset The Box The front of the box is standard Lego fare, other than the large Anna and Elsa in the bottom right corner. Oh, and surprisingly, nowhere on the box is the normal minifig lineup. The only way to know what characters are included is to look at the set pictures. The 1:1 This set uses one of the minidolls as the actual size sample. That's probably not a bad choice since the minidolls are not nearly as well known as a minifig. The Back On the back, the play features are shown in insets around a rear view of the castle. Like Friends sets, you also have an array of play accessories. The Seals Is this standard on 2015 sets or is this specific to this set? I've never seen 3 tape seals on a set. Even huge modulars or Technic sets only have 2, so 3 on a set this small seems excessive. Perhaps Lego expects people to try to steal the dolls? If so, why bother with extra tape? A tiny pocketknife makes quick work of the tape so the third strip doesn't even slow you down. The Contents In the box are 2 instruction booklets (bent), a white plate, a sticker sheet, and 3 numbered bags of parts. The Stickers These are very hard to photograph since they're shiny. I mean polished chrome shiny. Those dark lines across the corners are not really there, they're reflections of my ceiling. The Manual Backs The back of one booklet has a Friends ""Win!"" girl. The other has an ad for the Lego Disney Princess website. That site is SO girly there's even sparkles following your mouse cursor around. So I didn't stay too long or look too deeply. The Sample Page The interior pages of the manuals are on lavender backgrounds. It's standard Lego instructions with part callouts and insets when needed. The Build, 1 The first thing you build is Anna, but I'm not showing that yet. Then you build this little picnic scene. It's tiny but effective, and nice to have something not icy in the set since the movie has the ""In Summer"" song for Olaf. I'm curious what's in that sandwich though - green and pink? After the picnic is the Olaf build, but I'll save him for later too. The Build, 2 Next is this small sleigh. It has an amazing amount of style for something so small. The curved front and decorative whips on the back make it look sleigh-like instead of blocky. But come on, it already had pink accents, are the pink flowers really necessary? Technically, yes, so the whips can mount to them, but still, it's just over-girly for my taste. The Build, 3 The sleigh needs a ramp to help it rocket along (for a couple inches, at least). The ramp starts like this, with a hidden lime green jumper plate that gets a cookie on it. I couldn't remember anything in the movie like that, so I asked my wife and she couldn't either. A hidden cookie under a hill? The Build, 4 After putting the tilting 2x8 onto the base and adding decorations, this is the result. A lime green bucket holding a pair of ice skates, a flower (in the snow, really?), green and white round studs that I assume are supposed to be grass and snow? The Build, 5 The sleigh looks huge sitting on top of the tiny hill, but it actually works pretty well. Assuming you're on a smooth surface like a table, you can give the sleigh a little nudge and it'll shoot down the ramp and a few inches across the table. The unevenness of the slopes vs the blue tiles holds the sleigh in line well, and the bumps in the slopes don't seem to hamper anything. The Build, 6 Moving on to bag 2.... man that's a lot of colors in this base already. And I'm already starting to feel like there's trans-blue cheese thrown around randomly. The Build, 7 Continuing (and rotating), some steps and even more colors thrown in. Magenta? In Elsa's ice palace? I sure don't remember any of that... The Build, 8 Wait, seriously? An ice cream stand in the castle? That is what the magenta is for? I kinda actually like the looks of it, but it doesn't fit the set. The Build, 9 Spinning back around, now there's a light aqua spiral staircase added along with a roof. This is where I'm really starting to wonder about Lego's thinking. Those light aqua stairs, and the light aqua 1x4 tiles, are exclusive to this set (as far as I know... it's possible some other 2015 sets use them, but nothing in Bricklink yet). Seems expensive (to produce) to me, when there's no huge reason to need them. Another blue for the tiles would have been fine. And the spiral stairs? Really? Elsa's castle is KNOWN for staircases, but NOT spiral ones! There should be a huge straight ice stairway out front or sweeping curved stairs inside, but not a spiral. The Build, 10 And now we finish the tree. Again, why? Where is there a tree next to Elsa's castle? And so weird... with ice hanging from green branches that have both snow and flowers on them. Huh? Did Lego watch a different movie? The Trans-Light Blue Bits Before looking at the upper level, a brief pause to look at some other parts. Here's the 1x2x5 brick in trans-light blue and the 2x4x6 rock panel in glitter trans-light blue. Do those look like the same blue to you? And again, ANOTHER unique part for this set. Why do those rock panels need to be glitter, when Lego made the same panel in trans light blue in 2013 and 2014 for SuperHeroes, Friends, and Chima sets? Apparently Disney REALLY wanted glitter, because there are a bunch of trans-glitter parts in the new Princess sets. There's trans-neon green cones for Jasmine; Ariel, Jasmine, and Sleeping Beauty all get glitter trans purple cones. So there's a bunch of new glitter parts for 2015. The Build, 11 Back to building - time to add the upper level. We get a bedroom with a decent bed, although stickered. The Build, 12 The other side of the bedroom has some little accessories. Perfume and a crown I assume? The Build, 13 Time for walls and a roof. I like the small white macaroni bricks for a wall, but what's with the lavender fence piece in the center? I'll grant that it looks nice (a common white fence would have been a little boring), but it's ANOTHER unique piece to this set. The Build, 14 The very top of the castle is built separately. Not a whole lot to say here other than why is there a torch in an ICE CASTLE? The Finished Castle Once the roof is put on, the castle is done. And that big purple star on top says everything to me about the styling. It just doesn't look like modern Lego to me; it looks like this should be an old Belville fairy tale set from around 1999. If I saw a photo of just the castle with no figs (or picnic blanket), I'd assume that's what it was. The Oops, Not Actually Done Yet Accessories At the end, there's a few bits left to add. There are these dark purple skis (yup, another unique part) in the lower level. Let me tell you, they're a pain to get into that location, at least with my big man hands. More Accessories The top level gets a stickered book. The sticker has a nice castle image on it that is, while not quite exactly the castle from Disney World, VERY Disney-looking. I actually had to google and see if that's the castle they use in their logo. Nope, but it's the same style. The Leftovers There are a LOT of extra parts in this. That's almost 10% of the part count in the set right there! They are pretty useful overall though. It's great to have an extra ""carrot"" and brown ""branch"" for Olaf, since you know those will get lost as he's played with. The Figs Finally, the reason for the set. Let's face it, the castle set is just an excuse to make these figures. And they're GREAT. I mean just fantastic. The print on them is just such a good match to the real characters. Compare to the cartoon version from the front of the box. Elsa's hair is a little darker than the cartoon, but overall these are just dead on. If I had to pick out a flaw, it's the ""spell"" Elsa is holding. It's too bad she can only shoot it forward with her arm down like that. It'd be nice to have the end of the splash part bent 90 degrees so she can have her arm forward and the spell shooting forward too. Oh, one other thing. The minidoll heads don't press down tight to the body like minifig heads do. There's still exposed neck. It looks nice, but it means Elsa's cape can swing around. The Fig Backs Elsa's cape is glittery on the back and you can see the removable bow in her hair. The Full Set One final issue. When you put Anna on the sleigh, her cape doesn't have enough flexibility (since it's a wraparound kind) and so it folds out funny. That's why on the back of the box it shows her standing on the back of the sleigh with Elsa in the seat. Edit: How on earth did I forget to comment on those orange flowers to each side of the castle? I'm pretty sure Elsa did NOT have any flowers blooming outside her castle! The Conclusion Hm. I really wanted to like this set, but I just can't quite bring myself to. It feels like Lego pulled a random castle design from the files then redid it into white and trans blue to look icy and allow a Frozen tie in set. The figs are great, but the castle isn't. I guess the real castle in the movie would be a boring set and this one has play features, but it just is too different for my taste. The Ratings Value: 7/10 - $40 for less than 300 parts is high (especially when so many of the parts are tiny, but on the other hand there's a LOT of rock panels and 1x2x5 trans blue panels), but the figs help save it. Design: 4/10 - Not one of Lego's best. Not as bad as the lows in the 90s, but not a great set. Minifigs: 10/10 - Possibly even a 12/10. They ARE the reason to buy the set . Playability: 8/10 - There are a bunch of play features, but they actually detract from the design, so I had to knock off a couple points. Parts: 7/10 - A bunch of impractical unique parts (how often do you need dark purple skis or a lavender fence piece?) but also a bunch of nice parts if you wanted to make your own icy scene. Overall: 7/10 - A great bunch of figs, but I'd recommend not bothering with the manuals. Just use the parts to build your own castle that's better."

I have the same opinion about the design, looks like Belville. I bought it on Legostore Orlando December 30th. It was impressive. My wife saw them putting on shelf, 8 or 10 boxes. She ran and grabbed the last one! The girls faces around it was indescribable, mix of ecstasy and afraid to loose it. It happened in less than 2 minutes. My 7 yo girl didn't want it. She likes the dresses but hates the movie. Prefers Lego Movie. But my 2 yo girl who never saw the movie grabbed it for good, and we bought it. Lego will sell it like water, but I do not understand why a set so small. It is the WORST SET DESIGN since the introduction of Lego Friends. My 7 yo has more than 50 Lego friends minifigures, all the Lego fiends stores and concluded that the castle had a terrible design. She is 7!! Let's be honest, Lego should have released this sets months before this Christmas and is loosing a perfect opportunity to sell a decent set, with much more pieces.

I'm sure that's WHY they used them for this set. Now, if you're looking for realism (like the photos in your sig seem to be), it might be tougher. But I've been thinking about using those big glittery panels to make a waterfall-type scene. The guys over in the historic forum will kill me if my MOCs start to glitter I'll take a closer look when I see the set in a shop (and, as I understand, I can sell the minifigs for the price of the set...)."

It will be pretty comprehensive since the finished built will be quick and will be focusing more of what kind of fun that you can derive from there. This polybag was bought in September 2013, when I visited LEGOLAND Malaysia and I did not hesitate to put this in my shopping basket. Name: 30253 Leonidas Jungle Dragster Theme: LEGO System / Legends of Chima Year: 2013 Pieces: 30 Minifigs: 1 minifigure Price: USD N.A, GBP N.A, EURO N.A, SGD N.A Resources: Brickset, BrickLink An original polybag image of the 30253 Leonidas Jungle Dragster Back view of the original polybag image of the 30253 Leonidas Jungle Dragster The road scout of the Lions Tribe This polybag design is definitely plan to be the quickest and fastest dragster to recce enemy front by making a swift scout for the Lions Tribe. I believe by the sound of the name, Jungle Dragster, it might just be suitable to use in jungle terrain. Well, I don't quite agree that this is a 'Dragster' even though it has the kind of open view concept of rolling in fast but it does not have the length of a typical dragster, similar to this Town polybag design, for example. Still, it is nice to have smaller variants of their vehicular supremacy. Instruction Manual (Front) Instruction Manual (Back) The LEGO building content With just 30 LEGO elements, you can be pretty quick to be able to display these laid out content. After the built is completed, these are the remaining spare parts. I am fond of the wheels which are some useful parts, other than that, there are nothing spectacular about it. My name is Leonidas and I belonged to the Lions Tribe Do not be mistaken of his name, Leonidas to be the King of Sparta who led the brave men of 300 Spartans Warriors to fight to the death against the Persians. Instead this character is based on the bio resided in LEGO.com, you will realise that he is aligned with the Lions tribe and is a proud Lion foot-soldier. He may have that goofy idiotic look but he can be very serious in his commitment to discharging his duties. You are able to observe his nice back view printing which reveal his black and blue sash. Leonidas has a dual facial feature to reveal his much serious appearance. Leonidas is one of the common characters available in the Legends of Chima universe. It can be found in a total of five sets. It is a great pity that there is no weapon being made for him in this polybag design which will certainly make a fine addition. The completed built of the Jungle Dragster This is the main design of the Jungle Dragster which is very simple looking. There is no distinct fighting capability from the vehicular design and it look just like a regular patrol vehicle. One thing I like about this, is the close distinct colour schema of the Lions Tribe. Other than that, there is nothing special about it. Moving off with my Jungle Dragster To conclude, this polybag is really meant for LEGO fans or collectors who appreciate Legends of Chima or wanting to sample the Legends of Chima theme. It is a very simple built, but yet could form a decent force size for recce purposes before sending in the big arsenals to whack their enemies. Either way, I will only suggest you to buy it if you really love this theme at an inexpensive price. Otherwise, it is perfectly alright to give this a miss. Summary review Playability: 4/10 (You need to have more Lions Tribe vehicles in order to bring the best and fun out of it since this is more of a supporting vehicle.) Design: 4/10 (Simplistic built of the dragster and main focus is just acquiring the minifigure.) Price: 4/10 (Bought at about USD$7, which is not an awesome price, so get it if you can get it more than half of this price.) Overall: 4/10 (If only you are a huge mega fan of the Legends of Chima, then you need to get this.) I gave it a ""2"" based on my Review Score Card. What about yours? I hope every one of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. Comments and Criticisms are strongly welcomed. Pictures can be found in My Flickr."

Hadn't been expecting this one for a while, so a nice surprise. *sweet* Firstly the box. Nice pic on the front. Good selection of minifigs. The officer and pilot look cool with their dark blue trousers. A new R2 unit as well. Don't remeber this in the film, but great to have one in a new colour. *wub* Back of the box shows some of the ship's nifty features. First thing you notice when you open the box, is the awesome selection of bricks. This makes a for a great parts pack. Loads of unusual red and dark red pieces. It's so refreshing to see a Star Wars set that isn't predominantly grey. There are also two instruction booklets. As soon as you open the first booklet you hit an error. Why would I want two Obi-Wans? :-| It's also at this point that you come across a big disappointment. On the box you get a flesh Qui-Gon. What is actually in the box is an EpIII Obi-Wan. Come on LEGO - why change it? |-/ All the figures look impressive in the flesh despite the BIG mistake. Once I started the build it progressed rapidly. Red pieces seem to be a lot easier to find. Lots of clever techniques. Quite a few Technic elements get used at the start. It reminded me of building a Technic set from the 80s at times. Here is the main body half way through the build. The landing mechanism is a nice touch. Its not fully retractable, but still folds away nicely. You find the ship keeps tipping over as you build it despite the feet, as it's only at the end thay it all becomes evenly balanced at both ends. Here the feet are extended. You can also see the yellow knob that rotates the radar on top of the ship. Landing gear up viewed from the front. Here are the radar. A great collection of dishes. They spin easily with little friction. Here is the ship at the half way point. The front works well with the top flipping up to squeeze in the pilot. More to come... :-)"

Once you start to add the engines, the ship really begins to take shape. The main body of the ship has a few surprises hidden away under a removable cover. Inside you get some retracting guns, a storage box, a little shuttle and space for a droid and figure. Here is everything you can fit inside. The guns are concealed behind the side vents. Pushing them forward causes the vents to open. Closed: And open: The final feature is the passenger area/escape pod. Inside is plenty of space for two figures. The pod cleverly attaches by pushing the front section of the ship forward, sliding the pod in, then returning the front. Everything locks together and is held securely in place by an elastic band. :-) Here's a couple of pictures of the final model. It's not the most beautiful creation ever, but it is an excellent representation of the ship from the film. The angular shape actually suits a LEGO build well. There's one more useful feature. The whole ship can be safely and comfortably picked up by two ball ended Technic pins towards the back end. It balances well at this point and does allow you to swoosh the ship around much more easily. This was the most enjoyable Star Wars build I've had in a long time. Everything progresses nicely with almost no repetitive bits. The ship looks good and is also HUGE! *sweet* Compare it to the 6211 ISD and you'll see it's only fractionally smaller. When I first saw pictures of this on the internet I thought it looked OK. Once you see it for real it is much more impressive. For ?69.99 in the UK I'm not complaining. It's the best value Star Wars set of the year so far. To conclude: Pieces: 9/10 Minifigures: 7/10 (would be a 9 apart from the stupid Qui-Gon/Obi-Wan head error) Playability: 8/10 Originality: 9/10 Set Design: 8/10 Overall: 8.2/10 The box says this is a Limited Edition set (whatever that means).

As I looked at the recent Technic sets, this was one that I thought looked interesting, but not enough to buy. So when the opportunity to review it came up, I jumped! It's a European-style heavy tow truck with pneumatics and motors, so that's pretty cool. And it's GREEN. It's a surprisingly uncommon Technic color. There's the 2015 24 Hour Race Car, but other than that and some of the small sets, this is it. So there should be lots of new part availability and so forth for people to geek out over. Let's see how it looks.... Name: Service Truck Set Number: 42008 Pieces: 1276 Price: $129.99 Minifigs: n/a Theme: Technic Year of Release: 2013 Links: Bricklink Peeron Brickset The Box A normal Technic box. Except for the exciting info in the bottom corners indicating that this set has BOTH Power Functions and pneumatics. That's pretty rare but very cool. The Back of the Box A lot more detail back here - both the main and B models are shown with their functions and sizes highlighted in a multitude of languages. With all the details I'm surprised that the HOG steering isn't identified anywhere. The main model does show that there IS steering, and most Technic fans see the gear on the cab roof and immediately know what that means, but I was surprised it isn't called out anywhere. As for the B model, instructions are online only, not printed, but that's normal. It seems to have a lot of functionality for a B model but is very similar to many other Technic sets with a claw arm and trailer. The Contents There are a TON of bags in here. Small ones with small parts, big ones with big parts, some PF parts, and a bag full of pneumatic stuff (including precut hoses, unlike old pneumatic sets). Oh, and 3 manuals and a sticker sheet in a bag together. No cardboard, but the books are enough to be reasonable protection for the stickers. Seriously though, SO. MANY. BAGS. The REALLY? The reason for so many bags? Not just the 1200+ parts, but also bags like this. There are TWO identical bags like this. Why on earth weren't they combined? I just don't get it. I'm sure there's something in Lego's packaging and logistics to explain it, but I don't see it. The Manuals Three thin books. Not much to say, other than this is a 2013 set so one book has that Win kid on the back. Eek. The Sorting Instructions So Lego obviously thinks you should sort the parts. Makes sense, since there are no numbered bags or anything like that. Just 1200 and some parts to look through. Being Technic, it's easier, since there's tons of black pins and blue axle pins and so forth, but there's still a lot to look through. However, sorting it right either needs a bunch of dedicated space, or a bunch of containers. I had neither, so I did this: The Part Sorting, Sort Of That's most of the parts, in the box. I kept them sort of sorted by size. There are a few things I left out - the wheels, big panels, pneumatic and PF parts, etc, but that's 90+% of the parts right there. Not TOO bad, and as long as you're careful, you can move the box around when you need to clean up for the night. It does how how oversize the box is though! The Stickers A BUNCH of stickers for this set. And they're not terribly useful for anything else. They're very specific to the tow truck, and they're mostly cut for the Technic panel shapes so they'd be weird on anything else. They do add a LOT of detail and color to the finished set though, so for once I will actually use them! The First Step The first actual page of the manual. I'm used to manuals having a picture of what you're making at the front - makes sense when it's a City set with multiple vehicles. Here? I just found it hilarious to see the finished truck there at step 1. The manual is standard Technic though - plain blue background, part callouts, and lots of sub-assemblies. The Build, 1 After a few pages, we have this. Anyone used to modern Technic can figure it out pretty quickly. This is the steering for the two front axles. As usual, it's some great engineering. The green beams under the arms of the second axle make the distance from the pivot point to the gear rack different, giving different turning radii to the axles. It may not be exactly right due to the limits of Lego parts, but the concept is certainly there and the functionality of the set is better due to it. The Build, 2 More pages, more pieces added. Again, any experienced Technic builders can recognize what's happening here. A vertical axle for the HOG steering, some frame at the front for a cab to be built off of, and some beams out the back to start building the body of the truck. And of course, a bunch of random-seeming pins and parts that'll be used for connections later. The Build, 3 Now things start getting interesting. This is the main gearbox. There's two red driving rings with then the dark grey gears to transmit the power to the light grey gears below. I'd bet money that the axle between the driving rings will be powered and there's gears coming that'll drive both axles from that simultaneously. And as an important note - the axles below (with the light grey gears) are NOT connected all the way through. The gap in the beams below the red driving rings is a gap in the axle as well, so there's 4 totally separate outputs on this gearbox. The Build, 4 This is now rotated and flipped from the last pic of the gearbox (note the axle with the universal joint in each photo). But I was right - the tan gears let the center axle drive both of the side axles with the driving rings. A motor will get connected in there and then we have 4 outputs, 2 of which could run at the same time. There's the axle with the universal joint, the black axle above the three tan ones (parallel to the u-joint), the back left output which gets redirected and ends up going to the dark grey 8 tooth gear in the top middle, and then the back right output which is not currently visible. The yellow connector sticking off to the right is a control handle to shift between two outputs, and there's a matching one on the right. All in all, a LOT of complexity in a small space! The Build, 5 That universal joint gets connected to another in order to take an off-center drive axle and connect it to a centered linear actuator. It also of course allows the LA to pivot. The Build, 6 The pneumatics appear! This grey cylinder is a pump. Turning the tan axle will rotate the short blue liftarms and power the pump. I'm sure this will connect into the gearbox for power, but there's a ways to go before we get there. The Build, 7 Actually, nope, I was wrong. That frame with the pump mounts right into the gearbox and onto the chassis. I've also added the winch, so now 3 of the 4 outputs from the gearbox are in use (large LA, pump, and winch). You can't see it, but the motor is also installed under the gearbox to drive it. The Build, 8 The 4th output of the gearbox drives these mini linear actuators. The drive is coming in on the gear closest to the camera and then the other 2 gears transfer power up to the far LA in sync. The Build, 9 Here's what those mini-LAs drive. A pair of spade-type outriggers. Since this is a heavy-duty tow truck that'll often need to pull loads out of ditches and so forth, these can dig into the ground for a lot of holding force. The Build, 10 Time to set the chassis aside for a while and build this. It's interesting how differently they can use identical pneumatic cylinders. The one in the black section can only swing the lower piece through a 90 degree angle. The one on top, despite a 2 stud stroke, manages to move the 15L beams a massive 9 stud distance thanks to the clever lever design using the 3x5 L beam and 5L beam. The Build, 11 So much added, so fast. The arm from the previous step attaches to the large LA to form the main crane arm of the truck. The pneumatic tubes all come together to a pair of valves to control those functions. Mechanically, the truck's pretty much done and there's still a book and a half to go in the instructions. That's a lot of bodywork to be added! The Build, 12 The bodywork starts with the cab. The battery box sticks in the usual Technic truck location behind the cab. Thankfully, it gets a sticker with green and red arrows that will help with knowing direction for functions later. The seats are black and grey instead of the blue that they often are. This is also an unusual case of a bare connection that ends up in a finished model. See the pin sticking forward between the seats? It's one of these used to stabilize the vertical axle that will be the steering. Only the pin on one side is needed, but this piece () wasn't available yet. The Build, 13 And that takes care of the cab. A few stickers here, but there's lots left on the sheet. Susanne gets a nice license plate too. It almost actually feels bland though. Especially once the rest of the truck is done and stickered, it feels like there should be more detail on each side of the grill here. And the black tubes for the sides of the windshield are a cheat. They don't line up vertically - the bottom is a stud farther forward than the top, so it needs to be something angled. It makes sense, most windshields ARE angled, but where many Technic vehicles would use axles there, there's no easy way to modify the bottom to put a connector for an axle instead (the top could take an axle though). That's why it's tubes - they have enough flex to do it. As for functionality, the doors open. That's about it. There's enough going on in the back of the truck I can forgive it though. The Build, 14 Here is one of the side panels. The other side is just a mirror image. It's a nice decorative panel, but why didn't they put one more of the small triangular panels above the ""service"" to smooth out the slope some more? Anyway, once you put these two side panels on and add the wheels, it's all done. The Side Comparison The side panels REALLY add a lot to this design, so I wanted to show exactly how much ""mess"" they're hiding. All the mechanicals of the bare truck are so cluttered by necessity, where the panel just smooths everything out and makes it look less Lego. I like the finished look. And since each panel is held on by just 3 pins, they're easy to remove to get to the battery box or fiddle with the internals. The Good Here's everything in the ""deployed"" position. You'd never actually use them all at once, but here it is. The crane arm has a decent amount of height, considering it's usage on a tow truck, and the extension on it works well enough. It's also good that the main boom uses an LA rather then pneumatics so you have height control. Full up there would be WAY too high for the wheel lift! Now that we have tires on, check out the front steering. Nice engineering making the dual steered axles do different angles like that. It's not something we see on real trucks here in the USA since the dual-front axle design is not common, but it's nice to see implemented. The Bad There are several small things that annoy me (and those of you with OCD will feel the same I'm sure) so let me point a few out. Each side of the truck has a flip-up panel with one of the gear shift levers underneath. There's a sticker to indicate functions, but due to the design of the truck, the sticker isn't centered over the lever. What? Look at the hoses coming off the small pneumatic cylinder on the hoist. They get in the way of the wheel lift coming up all the way. I'm not sure why they didn't design it with those hoses coming off the other side of the cylinder - I might have to mod it and see if there's a reason I'm not seeing now. There also is no good place to put the hook. As I played around with the truck, it kept snagging on other parts as they moved. The outriggers only come just to the table surface. They don't extend far enough to actually dig into the ground if you had it on dirt. but that's probably ok. They're nice looking but a little flimsy, so if they extended further, since most kids will use this on a hard surface, they'd try to lift the back end of the truck and fail. Access to the battery box switch is fairly tight. It looks roomy enough, but as a 6'3"" guy with man-hands, it's tight getting my fingers in there to control it. Too bad they didn't use the PF switch and put it somewhere more accessible. The Video Note when I show the pneumatics at the end, there's an issue with the pump. Since there's very little tubing and no air tank, it builds up to max pressure very quickly. That leads to a loud clicking sound when the pump is running, since it's being forced to compress with no room for the air to go, and then the pump slams back open as soon as the gear turns a bit further. It's loud and annoying. Once you start using the functions, it quiets down, but then gets loud again a few seconds later. The Conclusion So, what's my conclusion on this set? Pretty cool! This was one of a series of service trucks in a short span - 2012 had the Pick-Up Tow Truck, and 2011 had a Flatbed Tow Truck - but you have to go back to 2006's famous 8285 Tow Truck to get a more direct comparison. I've built the 8285 and it's an awesome truck, but different in many ways than this one. 8285 is much larger and has a bigger piece count, so everything is bigger. However, that leads to a lot of empty space in the truck. There's not many Technic vehicles made that have as much empty room in them as the 8285. Also, 8285 had no motor, so you had to pump the pneumatics by hand. This one is much nicer in that regard. Overall, I like it better. For a non-flagship set, this packs a TON of features. The Ratings Value: 10/10 - It's so close to the famous 10 cents a part mark, and there's so many useful parts. Lots of panels, PF, pneumatics, so it's solid. Design: 8/10 - As a whole, great, but there's a few details that could be improved. Minifigs: n/a - Playability: 9/10 - Lots of functions, and it's in a common Technic scale so I bet it would work well for towing other vehicles around. It'd be better for smaller fingers than mine though. Parts: 10/10 - It's got both pneumatics and PF, plus if you want green Technic, it's the only place to go. It's the only source of 1x7 beams, the best source for 1x9 and 1x13 beams, and the only current(ish) source for green panels. Overall: 9/10 - Very solid."

While a nice idea in theory, the haphazard mix of pneumatics and LAs just doesn't work IMO, severely limiting playability. It does use both, but used each where it made sense. The wheel lift just needs to be up or down, so use pneumatics there. Ditto for the extension of the crane (though a way to slow them down would be nice rather than slamming each way). But the crane boom and outriggers benefit from slower motion and being positionable, so LAs make sense there. I suppose the outriggers could have been pneumatic, but the fast action would have been awkward. Now, I'll grant that actually USING all the functions here is a bit awkward, since you've got pneumatic valves on both sides, gearbox levers on both sides, and a battery box direction switch on top. But that's due to the compact size of the set. Moving everything to one side would have been impossible on this scale."

Overall not as good as some, mainly because the engineering lets it down and the price per piece is better in other sets, even accounting for the motor and pneumatics. It could do with the thinner wheels at the front, like the VW camper van. Those wheels have not appeared in enough sets, especially as a set of 4 or more. the trapping of the pneumatic hoses really lets it down. I tried the rear cylinder the other way round but then the hoses clashed with the stabilisers. It would be possible to open up a gap in the stabiliser system to accommodate the hoses. The rear wheel beams move about, which is sloppy. These could be easily fixed more rigidly. The chassis bends a bit in the middle. Needs extra beams for rigidity. If I remember (before I took mine apart) the uni joints liked to pop off the large LA under load. The motor lead was not easy to route to the battery box without it becoming trapped or fouling the steering mechanism. The steering rake is better than in some sets - this is a function at which Technic sets are usually poor. The best part of the build was the gearbox. There was a lot of adding panels towards the end - it even felt like a lot as I mirrored the green side panel builds as a single process. A good parts pack for green parts and pneumatics but not quite so good as the model it is meant to be. I would have preferred black or grey for the chassis beams, though I expect red was the colour of the prototype vehicle. I agree that the new 1/11 pneumatic cylinder would have improved the crane arm extension function. Perhaps a comparison is needed between the pneumatic cylinders in this set (1/5.5?) and the 1/5 cylinder in 42043. If the one in 42043 is shorter then this might explain the reason for doing this set, to use up the stock of older cylinders, especially if a newer design includes a reliability improvement. The 1/5.5 cylinder has been a bit awkward to build with as its extension is just less than 2M. I used it for some pneumatic stepper motors but they have to stretch a bit as the parts flex. Mark"

He sure is a good example of a vocal minority ;) Edit: I see the extensive reply by Mark Bellis only now. Good post :) /edit I do like this set. I don't own it, but I think the designer has pulled of something quite remarkable, seeing the almost complete lack of unused space in the truck. It surely forfills the ""interesting build"" criterion with ease. It might have a playability problem, as you can read on the Techlug review which, if I remember correctly, is written by Anio and that this Eurobricks review doesn't really touch upon (however I haven't watched the video, so maybe it's there). For the rest, the review is great, and I really love the photography here - crisp, colorful and without distractions. The conclusion talks about 8285 too much, which is not what I'm interested in if I click a 42009 review, but as for the rest the review seems pretty extensive. So great job on that :) But, that said, Anio should really work on his communicative skills. Also, in my opinion, you can't turn a whole set down because of a single design decision. Anio has a muddled view - he has decided he doesn't like it, so any positive aspect is waved away and every negative aspect is strengthened, due to confirmation bias on his part.

I think the fact that this set draws such strong opinions from many at least proves it is interesting, if nothing else. From a purely engineering and technical standpoint, I'd tend to agree that many of the functions don't work all that well. On the other hand, it is not clear what objective this set was trying to achieve. Anio, on 09 February 2015 - 04:10 PM, said: If you are a newbie at Lego Technic, build this set. I think Anio meant this negatively, but I actually think this could be good advice and could be seen as a positive. This set was released in a time when pneumatics were rare or had been absent for a decade. It managed to give us Power Functions, pneumatics, and mechanical functions all in the same set, and with a rare color at the same time. If you consider that the purpose of the set is to introduce a broad range of topics in a single model, I think it achieves that admirably. From that point of view, I'd actually recommend this set very highly to a new user. I'd recommend it as a parts pack for the same reason. As a study in optimally acheived intricate mechanisms, not so much. I like 8109 for that! 8285 was much the same. Mechanically it was quite simple, but you get a really BIG model with pneumatics and dampers for what was then a reasonable price. It was a good way to get lots of different things in just one model."

I think that is the fairest criticism. I really wanted to like this set. When it came out there were bad reviews, but the box images really caught my attention. Having built the A model, and the B model, both left me underwhelmed. The A model is significantly better designed than the B model, but that's hardly praise. I'm looking at it with 36-year old eyes though. If I was 8 or 10 years old, I think I would have loved this set. The A model packs a lot into a small space, it showcases how LAs work, how pneumatics work, and how a motor can power both via a gearbox. It's also got a great range of parts for building other things with. Being fair, the B model has some 'interesting' ideas, even if it looks ugly as sin and is useless to play with. I think the A model design is thoughtful (even if the tyres look daft), and the colour scheme is striking. With the new long slim pneumatic pump, and new tyres from the Skip Truck (http://www.bricklink...m.asp?S=42024-1) it could have been much more cohesive. As it is I wanted to strip it for useful parts, but my 5 year-old won't let me, and wants me to rebuild the B model back to the A model. So it has fans in the core target market I guess. Maybe it needs modding. Take an ugly duckling and fix the flaws?"

Especially here on EB where people are reviewing them months before they're even available in the states. I don't think there's ever a bad time to review a set. I plan on reviewing the Public Works and Holiday Home, which I bought recently on BL. I'll get to it eventually. Nice shadowbox, btw. Little tip: I try to avoid the corner so there is a pure white background and not the three seams coming together. But overall, great photography and great review. Good walrus! Good boy! I'm glad you reviewed this because it's on my potential wish list and seeing how many great parts are in there, I will definitely be using next month's budget on this. Care to have an alternate model build-off? >:-) EDIT: One more tip-Fabuland figures make great additions to set reviews... :-P"

After a late night of building Sunday evening, I couldn't wait to take some pictures and post a review on EB. So here it is: ------------------------------------- SET DETAILS ------------------------------------- Theme: Castle 2007 Set Name: Skeleton Ship Attack Number: 7029 Pieces: 628 Price: $69.99 (USD) ------------------------------------- THE SKELETON SHIP ------------------------------------- The box, excellent imagery boasting ""Special Edition"": The back of box. Once again, no alternate models: Two sets of instructions. Bags are numbered: The ship. My first observation was that it could be longer or have an aft section, but it isn't too bad: The front: The front contains a rubber band operated cannon like the Crossbow Catapult. It actually works pretty well: The hull/aft section. The entry is open with no doors. I think the bone pieces may be glow-in-the-dark but I haven't tested yet. The chest contains 4 standard gold coins: . I like the sides of the ship with the window pieces and shilds. The plank lifts inward: The mast is securely attached with a technic beam; and the top of the cabin is removable: The aft. It has the new castle lightning bolt pieces: Crows nest with red sail: Removing the cabin reveals a smaller cargo level with a mouse/rat: The sail. Mine was rather wrinkled in the box and it does not hang very well. I do like the pattern/design: And the last image of the ship, the top of the cabin removed. This is a great playability feature: ----------------------- ON TO THE CASTLE ----------------------- The front. It is built with three sections: 1) middle bridge section, 2) right building structure, 3) left catapult cave: Starting with the building section: The roof lifts to reveal my favorite part of the castle. It includes a small table, chicken/turkey leg, barrel, short sword, and gold goblet: The catapult cave section. The catapult rotates 360 degrees. The chest contains three colored gems: The back side: The bridge (middle section): A sliding mechanism pulls out allowing four brown tiles to collapse when pulling. More planks would have made the feature better (kind of like the Tygura Adventurers set): The middle section. I love the knight shield: A closer perspective: The back of the middle section: The knights. No new torsos, faces, or weapons: The skeletons. I really like the skeleton captain with beard and pirate hat: And lastly, the set includes two new silver orbs (for the catapult), and two projectiles for the ship's gun: ------------ SUMMARY ------------ LIKES: I like the combination of the skeleton ship and castle wall. I regret taking apart my castle to see how this new castle section could have been added. The set offers much playability with seven figs, accessible structures, and detailed accessories (two chests, crate, goblet, gold, gems, and barrel). Most of all, I like the thought of a castle on the sea with the doc. DISLIKES: Right after opening the box, I found the ship's sail rolled up and wrinkled. This is very disappointing. I may write Lego and ask for a replacement. I'm not sure if these can be ironed or flattened some how. In addition, lately all my set instructions have been badly wrinkled. Lego needs to pack these in boxes better o that they stay flat. Perhaps the paper is a little thinner too adding to the issue. The ship could have been longer with a molded back end (as mentioned above), but it still looks pretty good. I would prefer a smaller closed castle structure as opposed to a wall, but the sections that can be disattached are nice (esp. the building structure). I think the price is a little too much for the # of pieces (many small), and the box way too large. It really isn't much after building the set. ------------------- FINAL THOUGHT ------------------- This is probably the better of most of the new Castle theme sets but it is still a bit like Knights Kingdom. I would buy this set again for the likes mentioned above. I'm not sure how I plan to use this set as I don't want to rebuild the large castle any time soon, but it is a nice stand alone set with a lot of playability. Hope you enjoy the review."

TLC could have done a better job, but the sail is good, I like how its tethered. EDIT: I see your sail was wrinkled. If it is a canvas material like the old school pirate sails, you can iron it. I have done that before, and it makes the sails like new. (Or in your case crisp, since your sail is new, but wrinkled) Edited by SirNadroj, 31 July 2007 - 02:57 PM."

Like him, I'm going to swap the legs, so they're coherent with the soldiers from the other sets. Third note: is it just me or did you attach the two black gate pieces too high? Shakar"

Also keep in mind that the picture was taken looking down on the model that is sitting on the carpet. It makes the gap appear a little larger. In addition; for those of you that recommended ironing the sail, it worked great. I set the iron to low and used a t-shirt to protect the sail. It flattened it out perfectly. In fact, it worked so well, that I did the same with my old WW Weapons Wagon cover that has gotten wrinkled over the years. The iron worked perfectly."

The snowspeeder is not as good as the second snowspeeder and no where near as good as the first in my opinion, but i did love that first one. The k-3po fig is perfect and it is good to be getting more droids that aren't r2-d2 and c-3po. It is a shame about the stickers but that is the price of keeping the cost down i suppose (the only printed part in the whole set is the snowspeeder/x-wing windscreen).

This changed dramatically when the final images of the 24 Hours Race Car showed up. The front side of the car, especially the head lights, and the curvature of the side of car had changed a lot. The car obviously still resembled the prototype, but the new design raised a lot of eyebrows. The new design was considered a step back instead of forward. Eventhough I still liked the design, I must admit I liked the earlier design better too. With the emphasis on past tense liked. I am not sure anymore and this review will show you why. Like the Arctic Truck this set has a B-model which is well worth checking out. That's why this review includes both the A-model and B-model. For people who are on the fence, the B-model might actually convince them to buy the set after all. Let's see what this set is all about! Note: All images can be clicked for hi-res versions. SET INFORMATION Number: 42039 Title: 24 Hours Race Car Theme: Technic Released: 2015 Part Count: 1219 Box Weight: 2110 gr Box Dimensions: 47,8 cm x 37,3 cm x 8,7 cm Model Dimensions: 40 cm x 18 cm Set Price (MSRP): €99.99 / $? / £99.99 Price per Part: €0.082 / $? / £0.082 Links: Brickset, Bricklink THE BOX The box measures 47,8 cm x 37,3 cm x 8,7 cm and weighs well over 2kg (2110 gr to be precise). The width of the box is the same as the box of the Arctic Truck. This box also feels like it's filled to the brim. THE FRONT The front shows a picture of the main model in action, with radial blurred wheels to emphasize the motion of the car. The lower right section shows the dimensions of the model. Upon completion, it will measure a length of 40cm and a width of 18 cm. THE BACK Like the front, the back side has exactly the same setup as the box of the Arctic Truck. The top shows the functions of the model, while the lower left side shows the B-model and the lower right side shows the motorization options. The picture of the B-model looks so cool, it could be a model of it's own. At this point I was very eager to build both models and compare them. THE SIDE One of the sides usually shows a part in 1:1 scale. This time it's one of the wheels indicating the size of the model. CONTENT OF THE BOX The box contains: 1 Book(let) 1 Sticker Sheet 13 Bags 4 Tires INSTRUCTION BOOKLET Since I own two copies of the set, I also received two instruction booklets. What's catching my eye is that my second copy is supplied in different packaging than the first one. It's for the first time (that I am aware of) that the instruction booklet and stickers come in a sealed bag, without cardboard back. Hopefully this will be a new standard for all sets with sticker sheets. Instead of multiple booklets, this set contains a single square bound book. In earlier reviews I have epxressed my preference for a single book. I don't see any advantage in having 2, 3 or even up to 6 booklets. STICKER SHEET Like the actual model, the sticker sheet looks very vibrant. The bright green, white and black color combination has found it's way to the stickers as well. Either you love 'em or hate 'em. Since I started writing reviews I have been applying stickers and I am happy I started doing it. Stickers do give the model it's finishing touch. BAGS WITH PARTS Thirteen bags with a total of 1219 parts (give or take a few) are supplied in the densily packed box. The rims and flex are sealed in a bag as well. Sometimes looking at the bags makes you wonder what the logic is, behind the distribution of the various parts across the different bags. Well this time it really got me confused. Take a look at two of the bags below. There's a bag containing all the 3L Blue Pins. Then there's a bag with various parts....and a single 3L Blue Pin. I figured this might be an error, but both of the sets have the same anomaly. TIRES The tires have been supplied unbagged, as usual. HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This chapter describes new and interesting parts. This set actually contains a lot of them. This set also contains an abundance of panels. If you aren't into panels, this isn't the set for you. CHANGEOVER CATCH This year (2015) the new changeover catch parts were released. It's a combination of three parts. The advantage of the new parts is that the red gear is the same on both sides, which avoids mounting it the wrong way around. It also avoids the changeover catch slipping out of the driving ring, like it used to do. You can apply lots of pressure, but the catch doesn't slip out. PINS Some of last year's new pins are also included in this set. 12 x Pin with Pin Hole and 21 x 3L Pin with 1L Axle. Securing Technic Beams can be quite simple with the new Pin with Pin Holes. The new 3L Pin with 1L Axle gives you more possibilities when connecting Beams and other parts. Below are two example situations where the new pins have been used. Granted, the examples below can be accomplished by using other techniques. However, some predicaments from the past can be easily solved by using these new parts. Like me, you will most likely appreciate the ease of use. ENGINE AND SUSPENSION Also included are two Steering Portal Hubs and Steering Portal Hubs with Ball Joint Arms and four Steering Portal Axles for driving and steering the vehicle. These parts are commonly used nowadays. The picture below also shows some other parts, like gear rack, steering arms and suspension. FRAMES This set comes with a single 5x7 Frame and three 5x11 Frames. PANELS This set contains a whopping 47 panels in three different colors. I personally like panels a lot and I do appreciate the variety we have at our disposal lately. This set even contains a new 13x3x2 Curved ""Mudguard"" Panel. NEW 13x3x2 CURVED PANEL This is the first set to contain the new 13x3x2 Curved Panel. Looking at the pictures doesn't do these panels justice. In real life they are actually quite big. I figured they would be smaller, but they are even longer than the 11 x 5 frame, with a length of 13 (including the attachment points). Hopefully this part will be available in other colors as well, preferably white, for adding variety to your EV3 robot. 19L WHITE FLEX-AXLES The White 19L Flex Axles have only been released in a single set, the 8461 Williams F1 Racer in 2002. Current prices on Bricklink are as high as 15 Euros! Needless to say we are very happy with the return of these White Axles. Now we can build Jeroen Ottens' awesome Alfa Romeo 4C Spider for a decent price as well. I am really happy that useful rare parts are being used more often by TLG designers PART LIST Here's the complete list for all 1219 parts. As you can see in the Highlighted parts section, this set contains a lot of interesting and useful parts. If you don't own sets like the 8070 - Supercar, this might be the set to pick up if you want to start building your own supercar. THE BUILD Enough with all the set and part information, let's build the model. REAR SUSPENSION The build starts with the rear suspension and drivetrain. As you can see in the picture below, the length of the Axle between the Steering CV Joint is 4L, where it usally is 3L. This is an indication that the finished model will be a bit bigger than usual (8070 for example). The finished suspension is one of the cleanest suspension setups I have seen in an official model. It's pretty basic, but it works like a charm. This setup is defintely worth using in your MOC. Here's a video: After attaching the suspension to the frame you rotate the module and secure it. At this stage the rear section of the chassis with suspension is almost finished. V8 MID-ENGINE Extending the chassis forward results in the picture below, where the front spoiler is already visible. What's also visible is the V8 engine placed right in front of the rear axle, resulting in a Mid-engine setup, perfectly suited for sports and race cars. Two exhaust pipes have been fitted on either side of the engine, together with two hoses attaching them to the engine. The instructions are easy to follow, although you sometimes you need to bend the beams a bit. Minor improvements are possible here and there, but nothing shocking. FRONT SUSPENSION The front suspension is a bit more complicated than the rear suspension, which makes sense considering the fact it contains the steering rack. The shock absorbers are placed in a different angle than the rear ones, resulting in a somewhat stiffer front suspension. All in all the front suspension is well designed and the steering rack can be easily powered with a Servo Motor. The picture belows shows the front suspension attached to the chassis. If you follow the official instructions to motorize the model, the area in front of the suspension is used to mount the battery box. When you are modding this model to make it Full RC this area can be used to mount the servo motor. GEARBOX Like the gearbox in the 8070, it's not used to switch gears powering the drivetrain. It's used to switch between two functions, opening the doors and the hood/bonnet. The gearbox is located at the left of the vehicle, near the cockpit. The mechanism to open the doors is located on the left side, while opening the hood/bonnet is taking place at the right side. To accomplish this, some axles traverse under the cockpit to the other side of the vehicle. Following the axles to other side of the vehicle and adding some gears, results in the situation below. The video below shows the gearbox in action. DOOR OPENING MECHANISM The mechanism to open the door is comprised of some Knob Wheels, Links without Stoppers and Pins with Towballs. Take a look at the doors opening and closing. THE FRONT Using the new mudguards and various other panels you finish the front of the car. The front is probably the most controversial part of the car. This is caused by the preliminary pictures shown before the release of this car. In the early pictures the front of the car had smooth curves and beautiful lines, while the final car lost these smooth lines and got a more blocky look in return. I must admit that at a first glance, the new design lost some of it's appeal. However, this model grew on me pretty rapidly. The headlight design can be found, in more or less the same way, on several real Le Mans type race cars. THE REAR The rear of the car looks great, with the stickers continuing from the mudguards to the panels underneath the spoiler. The two exhausts sticking out give some details to the back. I absolutely disagree with all the negativity surrounding this car. Maybe it's one of those models which needs to grow on you. FINISHED MODEL Here it is, the finished model. I know some of you don't like the looks of the car, but I think it looks great. The color scheme is outstanding. The new (for Technic) bright green parts, combined with white and black make this car look very vibrant and colorful. I am not a big fan of the green used in the 42008 - Service Truck, but I do like this bright green a lot. It fits perfectly well with the Mindstorms EV3 set. The curves on the side of the car are not as smooth as some of us hoped, but I still think the car looks more than acceptable from the side. The stickers add some nice details to the car, giving it that characteristic race car look. The model looks great in pictures, but it does even look better in real life. I love this picture of the front of the car. However, I do wonder if a dedicated 24 hour Le Mans Racer has the seat and steering positioned off-center?! Using the good ol' Google Machine I come to the conclusion that they do have centered seating and steering, at least the majority of them. There's ample space in the cabin, which makes me wonder why TLG decided to place the seat off-centered. The rear view looks cool too, with some of the suspension showing and the two exhaust pipes clearly visible. The bottom view is very useful to determine the size of the car in studs. It measures approx 59 x 27 studs. The chassis looks organized and well designed. The engine has been placed close to the ground, which is perfect for the weight distribution. A low center of gravity improves the handling of the car. I really enjoyed building this baby. The build is very clean and organized, although there are some steps where you need to bend the beams a bit to get things into place. Seeing the model come to life and seeing it grow to pretty impressive proportions is very satisfying. For me it was fun, but I reckon kids will go nuts over this set and the build. SIZE COMPARISON What became obvious during the build, but what's emphasized when you have finished the model, is that it's quite big! The size of the car is pretty impressive. The pictures below show the car next to the 42030 - Volvo L350F. The side view emphasizes the size of the car. It's even longer than the Volvo, if you dismiss the bucket. PARTS LEFT Some parts left. Nothing out of the ordinary. FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS Unlike the B-model, this model doesn't implement any unexpected features. The functions it does implement are exactly what you would expect from any car. Steering (HoG) Working fake engine Suspension Opening doors (gullwing style) Opening bonnet/hood Opening trunk Gearbox for switching between functions Unfortunately the steering wheel hasn't been linked to the HoG (Hand of God) steering mechanism. Placing the seat in the center would have provided an easy way to link the steering wheel to the steering mechanism. it's a shame we hardly see actual steering anymore. Opening the hood actually opens up the entire rear section of the car, providing you with easy access to the motor compartment. The mechanism to open the hood works properly, which results in smooth opening and closing of it. The same goes for the gullwing style doors. Both functions are operated manually and you need to switch with the lever to the left of the cockpit. These two functions are also the ones which can be motorized by placing an M-motor near the cockpit and a battery box in the trunk. All things considered I think this car offers lots of playability. The model is solidly built and the functions are easy to operate. I'd say it's pretty safe to let your kids play with it. B-MODEL Unlike the A-model, the B-model for this set received (almost) universal acclaim, and I can see why. Often the B-model is a pale shadow of it's part donor. In this case the model looks so good, it could be a model of it's own. It even incorporates a neat feature, which actually deserves to be in the A-model. There's a lot a variation in the quality of digital building instructions TLG is providing, but these ones are of very high quality. The picture below shows most of the chassis with suspension, fake engine and gearbox in place. FINISHED MODEL Some concessions have been made, but overall the car looks fantastic. The black of the roof has been extrapolated from the hood, which definitely works for me. The rear section of the car feels a bit empty, but the panels do cover up most of it, so it's hardly noticeable. The V8 stickers will be upside down if you use the parts from the A-model. Since I could apply new stickers, I have placed them using the proper orientation. The bottom of the car shows the chassis. It's obviously a bit smaller than the A-model's chassis. FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS Taking the functions into account, this model isn't playing second fiddle to the A-model. Besides the obvious functions like steering, opening doors and hood, this car features folding fog lights, which deserve a better podium than a B-model. Steering (Hog) Working fake engine Suspension Opening doors (manually) Opening hood/bonnet (manually) Opening trunk (operated by gear) Folding fog lights (operated by gear) Gearbox (used to switch functions) FOG LIGHTS One of the most interesting features of the B-model are the folding Fog Lights. It almost feels a bit weird that a feature like this is implemented in the B-model, instead of the A-model. Below are 4 steps showing how the mechanism works. I have also included a video. The mechanism is somewhat reminiscent of fork mechanism used in the 8109 - Flatbed Truck, which has been described in Efferman's Review. Take a look at the video to the fog lights in action. PARTS LEFT A fair number of parts left, which isn't uncommon for a B-model. SUMMARY To summarize how I feel about this set, you need to take a look at the picture below. The combined image reflects the quality of this set....or better yet....sets! You actually get two great models, for the price of one. You don't like the A-model? No problem, you can have lots of fun with the B-model. I can't stop playing with the fog lights, it's mesmarizing. The color scheme on both models is outstanding. I simply can't emphasize enough how well this color scheme pleases the eye. The regular green is dull and boring, but this bright green really pops out, especially when combined with black and white, and possibly some red details. Black, white and a little red?! Sounds familiar? Yes, bright green can easily be combined with your EV3 robots. So while you are combining the bright green with your robot, why not use the great new curved ""mudguard"" panels. These new panels are introduced in this set and they look great. They open up a lot of possibilities in the design department. The build of the A-model is outstanding. It is fairly simple, but since it's so clean, I really enjoyed it a lot. I think the build should be entertaining, which doesn't mean it needs to be a real challenge. And let's be honest; when is a build really challenging?! The rear suspension is a good example of why I liked the build. It's very simple, yet very effective. Works like a charm. The same goes for the other functions in both models. And the star of the entire show can be found in the B-model. How's that for a surprise?! Being aware of the fact that I like this model a lot better than most of you seem to do, I really encourage you to give this model a chance. The sheer size is impressive, the color scheme is awesome and you get a bonus model, which is actually worth building. SCORE Okay, so how do I grade this set? 8 DESIGN Open to debate, but I like it a lot. 8 BUILDING EXPERIENCE Fun and clean build. 9 FEATURES Superb function in B-model steels the show. 9 PLAYABILITY Both models offer lots of playability 8 PARTS Lots of new parts and cool existing parts. 10 VALUE FOR MONEY Two models for the price of one. 8,7 TWICE THE FUN I hope you enjoyed this review!

I love the color scheme and indeed it looks like a nice set. Also 1200 parts for EUR 100 is not a bad deal. And yes, the looks of the car have really grown on my since the first official pictures appeared. I'm curious how the bright green will work combined with other colors than white. I really hope more sets in the future will use the color (so that more different parts will be available over time). I think I'm the only person on Eurobricks who doesn't like the looks of the B model, but I appreciate the extra functionality it offers. Besides the set itself, I think this is one of the best reviews I have read in a while. Great job on the superb photographs (which I think are essential to a review) and the extensiveness of it all.

I'm with you on the instruction manual, I much prefer one quality bound book over umpteen stapled booklets. Already have 2 of these sitting in the build queue, one for display model as I'm a fan of this one and one to build the B model then dissemble for parts, so I'm already sold on his set but still very much enjoyed taking the time it deserves to read through the review and ogle at your pro photography."

As for the model, I'm glad that they chose to make it less pretty - real Le Mans prototypes are rarely a sight to behold. It is function and aerodynamics over form. I would, however, have preferred more realism for the sake of learning: - The front shouldn't open like that - instead it should be easy to remove the whole front cover, leaving the suspension easy to work on. - The aero seems to be realistic, except for the rear end where there's no indication of a venturi channel. This should have been easy to include. - There is no fuel tank, nor fixed fuel connector right behind the cabin. - There are no air jacks! Seriously!? This is one of the most unique features of a race car like this... and LEGO forgot about them. Instead they automated two functions which are manual on a real race car. - The top cars at Le Mans are hybrids with ingenious systems. I would have loved to see the front wheels connected to some kind of spinning apparatus indicating a kinetic energy recovery system. If I get this set... I'm going to make some modifications."

You've taken the right pictures and the video demonstrations of the mechanisms really help get the good points of the set across. What's more amazing is that the review still feels very concise and to the point. You've actually convinced me to put this set on my list and not just as a decent parts pack.

I'm not sure air jacks are the feature that will have people fawning over this set, and pneumatics are being covered rather well later in the year ... but I agree with everything else, most notably removable front and rear bodywork (the removable engine cover on 8674 would be a good starting point here) and the inclusion of some nod towards a hybrid system. It's also worth remembering the preliminary design did have the Big Honking Fin (BHF) that is mandatory on all current prototypes, so maybe when that was removed any trace of a tunnel or diffuser went with it. On the subject of steering wheels, all modern prototypes actually have left or right hand drive. The regulations demand that both LMP1 and LMP2 cars are nominally capable of seating two people. Of course in practise the ""extra seat"" is taken up by the hybrid system in LMP1 and electronics/extra cockpit access in LMP2. However this doesn't change the fact that it would be easy to link the steering wheel to the HoG/front axle. Edited by Jay Psi, 12 March 2015 - 09:55 PM."

First the price it is not cheap at ?99.99 but I guess that is typical for a set with this amount of electronics in it.There is no parts count and I have not had time to add up the 2 pages of contents to get a figure. First the box standard flip top with large internal picture and rip to open lid. inside There are no numbered bags in this set which I prefer I like to open all the bags and put all the parts in the box before building. Next is a picture on the electronics 2 XLmotors as lego describe them and 2 standard motors. 2 IR receivers and 1 IR transmitter I know these have been discussed before but I really like the thought that has gone into the transmitters/receivers each receiver has 2 outputs to corespond with the 2 controls on transmitter they also have a choice of 4 channels so one transmitter can control up to 8 independant motors by changing the channel switch. The transmitter also has a neat motor direction switch so you can configure the transmitter operation. The set comes with three manuals 1 is the main drive mechanism 2 is the cab and engine and 3 is the attachments front and back. There is also the now standard parts list in the back of the third manual. There is no alternative model instructions despite the pictures of one on the box however there is a reference to the technic website on the back of the box but at the moment the page only has an advert saying the set is to be released on 1st September so I guess I will have to wait untill then to see if the instructions will be online. The build is fairly straight forward the main chassis is studless, the next picture shows the motors mounted into the chassis and the drive for the shovel and claw. It also shows the V6 technic engine. This next picture shows the IR receivers mounted on the back. The battery box slots into the back and can be easily slid out with the removal of two pins which is useful because I can imagine I will need to change the batteries on a regular basis. The next 2 picture are of the completed model Overall I was very happy with the finished dozer the functions work really well and as I have the monster dino I have used a second transmitter so I dont have to touch the channel switch, I have included some video On my Brickshelf page. Unfortunately this set does suffer from some quality issues for example moulding marks on the plates, colour diferences, some of the pins not finished properly, some pins were very stiff and quite hard to push into the holes but the worst issue was an axle that would not turn freely in a hole which just adds extra friction into the system. I am glad to see some studded technic in this set I much prefer sets that use both varieties of technic beam. There are only 2 Fairings which is a great improvment over recent sets if TLC had tried to make the bulldozer shovel with fairings this would have been a complete disaster. Marks for the set 8/10 for price with the number of motors I expected it to be greater. 9/10 for fun my kids love this type of set that does something when finished. 6/10 for quality TLC really need to work on this one. 8/10 overall I would definately get a second one if I see it in the sales. Feel free to post questions but I will be on holiday next week. More pics and Videos available HERE"

With only 106 parts this crane can roll, extend, rotate, lift (and hold in any position) and has working stabilisers! The boom extends the same as the other sets with this boom; simply pull it. It works surprisingly well and due to circular ridges inside the boom the extension (which is just a standard beam) will hold in place. The gear at the back controls the height of the boom. As you can see the boom is only half extended. Boom fully extended, half down. The cable is kept in place via two gears and a blue pin, same as the 7905 crane. Even under decent weights this works well. The stabilisers however cannot handle much weight once the load is moved off axis. The stablilsers are a very simple but effective design. Another shot of the stablilsers. This also shows how far the boom will decend. The boom height mechanism works well also. I love the cab design. Overall this is a remarkable achievement for the low price. I bought it for the boom piece as I want to improve the crane that came with 7998 7898 ( :-$ ). I highly recommend it."

That's what I'll do here, but there's quite a few photos, so I thought I might as well make its own review thread. So, I got the Kwik-E-Mart by paying just2much on an early eBay copy. I think it's worth it, as this week I'm gonna be super busy, so I was able to build it Saturday and stuff. Here's my video review, I think it's one of my best: Well, let's get onto this photo review. The set is $200 USD with a little over 2100 pieces. The official release is April 15th for VIP members, May 1st for everyone else at LEGO Stores. And, if you want full size pictures, check out my Flickr by clicking here. The minifigures included are great. You get three exclusive minifigures (one being a completely exclusive character- the first time LEGO has ever put an exclusive mould in a Direct to Consumer set), and you get three of the series most popular characters in their normal attire for those who missed out on the first Simpsons minifigures series. The Kwik-E-Mart's exterior is loaded with lots of sticker details. The only printed detail you'll see in the exterior is the dial pad in the phone booth, which has appeared in some other licensed themes since last year. ( ^^^ right here is there the store can be opened- a simple Technic pin and receiver keeps it in place and allows for opening and closing) The roof of the store includes the garden shown in the Paul McCartney episode. The roof can be slided out/in once you open it with the hinge part. Here's a look at the store with the roof removed. The floors are a nice sand blue color, coming with 8x16 thin plates: And, for the interior, from the view of the store opened with the hinges at the back that I mentioned earlier: The left front corner, which includes some arcade machines of Bonestorm and Great White Hunter, an amazingly done Buzz cola soda machine, juice machine, the checkout counter, ect: The right front corner, with food aisles, freezers, and a frozen Jasper sticker: The back left corner, which includes some nice coffee kettle builds, the donut tray, hotdogs, ect: The right back corner, which has a door leading to a very small hallway that only has a mouse and cheese in it. The hallway leads to the employees only door in the back, and it's very hard to get in the door way (not that there's anything to do inside there): Also included is Clancy's copcar, which fits three figures: Here's a look at the piece list in the instructions, click on each to be lead to an enlarged version of the pic: Also included are some awesome printed pieces, and two unprinted coffee cups! Honestly, I think this set is perfect. The price is fantastic, and has a great PPP ratio. They really went above and beyond by including Snake in this set. I honestly think it's better than the Simpsons House in terms of accuracy and the value here- so many cool pieces printed and in exclusive colors. So, that's my quick picture review. Hope you guys enjoyed, and I'd love to hear your thoughts!"

They could at least give us new torso printing, like Homer wearing his jacket or Bart wearing his blue t-shirt or Marge wearing her coat. Or, as I said in the discussion thread, I'd have included Jasper in CMF series 2 and a Frozen version here. Overall, the set looks kinda smaller than what I thought.

I agree, but so many people were complaining about how The Simpsons House should have included the most common versions (mostly because the eyes or whatever), so I think LEGO played it safe and just included the normal versions. It makes sense, since Series 1 is gone forever, and the common versions were in there, and this set is bound to be in stock for a very long time like the Death Star. I never really agreed when people were complaining about the alternate eye prints personally, but I guess this is a good business choice based on previous feedback.

English is not my native language, but I want to express my opinion. Simpsons house was the first of its kind, and I can say without exaggeration that this is the most impressive set that I'm going (my collection http://brickset.com/sets/ownedby-celeb ). I look at the video from the Kwik-e-Mart, and is difficult to say how good it is compared with the house. The main disadvantages that I said to myself, is this: build the walls of the large panels, next is access to the roof (gray parts in front of the back door (I think they represent the stairs)) is not on the level with doors on the roof and when you open them, you can see the white block is openly trash, my points of view. Boxes on the left of go to the store and powersauce box, i want see make real and not just a cube, f.e. such as in the unreleased Star Wars set. About minifigures, I fully agree with Robert8. Two more of the same Homer, Marge and Bart?! Personally, I put my set as a scene and all the replays minifigure are inside the house that was not identical characters next And also absolutely terrible Bart`s accessory This set is made parking for bikes and it looks very cool. But damn, it is hoped to see the Bart or Lisa's bike, instead of useless balloons with paint. The walls are made with convex inside panels, why so? can anyone know? have not seen any pictures with such walls in TV show. Why did not they turn? I personally really like how realized roof, but my brother says that it is terrible :) garden could do more in the series there were almost jungle I do not know how to be considered here, maybe anyone can express any opinion or idea? I look at the Simpsons house, and then look at the photo of this e-Mart. I can not understand, in the house we have a garage, two floors, cool floor, a lot of furniture, all the rooms and walls, collected from cubes, many additional accessories. And where is all this detail here? It looks much smaller (maybe even poorer). If they still will release next year comic book store, it will be even less? Of course it is difficult to estimate without seeing it live, we have it will be sold only in May. At first sight it does not look so impressive as the house. Can certainly the case in the limit on the amount of detail, but why it was impossible to add $ 50 to the cost and make Jasper, the more detailed the roof, the walls of the smaller elements, that it was not convex. Sad. Thanks all for attention. Edited by celeb, 13 April 2015 - 05:10 AM."

Strange coloured bricks on the outside wall (some ugly mix of yellow + tan) Panels again with their fronts facing towards the inside of the shop so we and up with those squares all around. The walls are yellow, this was so nice, lost opportunity to make it in some other less common colour. Then again the set overall looks is good. The roof is a nice detail. The shop looks actually like a real one, not just an approximation of one.

Sure, it looks like you get a lot more with the house, but the Kwik-E-Mart has a lot more of those little references that make it Simpsons. I agree with some of the complaining; a real Jasper behind a trans-blue panel would have been cool. You could always bulk up the roof with more foliage... I think it has a great foundation as a set, but could do with a few mods to make it better.

And what better way to create the future than to build it out of Lego! Since TLG always strives to inspire the builders of tomorrow, it is only fitting to make one of their Creator sets centered around futuristic vehicles. This 3-in-1 set gives us a glimpse into a possible future with three different kinds of vehicles: a mech, a jet, and a car. But does this future look bright or is it a dystopian nightmare? Let's find out! Set Number: 31034 Name: Future Flyers Theme: Creator Year of Release: 2013 Pieces: 237 Minifigs: 0 Price: $24.99 / €19.99 / £17.99 S@H description: Quote Thunder through the atmosphere with the 3-in-1 Future Flyers robot! Step into the future with the awesome 3-in-1 LEGO® Creator Future Flyers robot. This robot is geared up for action and features a super-cool, futuristic orange, white and black color scheme, large robo-head with a single piercing blue eye, removable backpack with foldout wings and removable rocket boosters. Also features large robo-feet with built-in rocket boosters, dark metallic fingers, armored shoulder pads and highly flexible, multiple hinged, posable joints. Soar into the sky with the powerful rocket pack, thunder through the atmosphere, land, and rebuild into a futuristic jet with variable wings or a high-tech, futuristic sports car. Now that’s an ultra high-tech 3-in-1 experience! S@H Bricklink Brickset The Box The box art is the same as all the other recent Creator sets featuring a yellow sidebar with the 3-in-1 logo in the upper right corner and the two alternative models displayed in boxes below it. Since this copy of the set came straight from Lego's headquarters in Billund, this is the European version of the box as you can tell by the lack of a set name and part count. The main image depicts the giant robot landing in a desert setting. The sky looks very interesting as it transitions from day to night from the left side of the image to the right and there are some meteors flying overhead. Maybe this is supposed to be some kind of alien planet where such a thing as a half-day-half-night sky can exist. Or maybe it is supposed to indicate the passage of time, symbolizing the movement towards the future... or maybe I'm just reading too much into the background image. The top of the box features the inventory and a 1:1 scale picture using the robot's ""eye"" for reference. There isn't much on the back of the box. It only shows the 3 different models and a small picture that tells you that the robot's jetpack is detachable. On the right side you can see that this is the type of box that has two tabs which make it easier to open it. I miss these tabs. Why don't American boxes have these tabs anymore? I bet it's because of people ripping them open in stores and stealing their contents. You disappoint me, 'murica! Inside the box there are three instruction booklets, one for each alternate model, and two bags, one smaller than the other. There aren't really any rare parts parts included, however many of them are quite useful, such as the white curved slopes, trans. light blue parts, and big and small ball joints. Here is a random instructions page. The part call-outs and building steps are pretty clear and the light blue background provides a nice contrast to the illustrations. To build up suspense, I will be reviewing the models in order from smallest to largest, building up to the main model. So let's start with the Future Flyers model that is not a flyer at all: The Car The build of the car is pretty straight forward, but somewhat unconventional. The chassis is made up of some parts that would usually not be used for the base of a car, such as wedge plates, curved slopes, and that white boat hull piece. Next, the aforementioned seemingly random parts are covered up by various plates. I like the cylinders in the back here because they give the impression that they could be part of the engine. After about 40 steps, the car is finished. It looks quite nice and does have a somewhat futuristic feel, especially thanks to the trans-light-blue bits. It doesn't resemble any particular existing car, so I'm guessing it's supposed to be a concept car. This is especially evident by the double canopies which are reminiscent of concept cars like the Ford Futura (which later got turned into the 1966 Batmobile). However, I feel like it doesn't really fit into the theme of Future Flyers. I think it would have fit the theme much better if the designers would have made the wheels like the ones of the DeLorean or Nick Fury's car and thereby turned it into flying car. Of course that would have required hinges or other parts that this set doesn't include and I realize that this is just an alternate model, but I'm just nitpicking here. Hey, I think I just figured out what makes this car so futuristic! Look, it has no steering wheel! This here must be one o' them fancy new self-drivin' cars. Unlike the DeLorean, this car fits two minifigs comfortably. However, since the inside of the car is filled with those random pieces, they sit a bit a high. Thanks to all the curvy white slopes, the car has a nice aerodynamic profile. Looking at it from the front, you can see that a ball joint was used to add detail to the grill of the car which is an interesting choice. The back is fairly plain, but it looks quite good. I especially like the use of the light blue dishes as headlights. The only thing that bugs me a bit is the small gaps between the upper corners of the bumper and the fenders, but it's hardly noticeable. Thankfully this is a Creator set; otherwise there would have surely been a license plate sticker covering the 2x4 tile. The Jet Let us now move on to the second alternate model, the jet. Its construction is fairly normal, except that the wings are only attached by one stud. Also, note the Mixels ball joint at the front. I will be talking about it later. The build lasts about as long as that of the car and there are approximately the same amount of parts left over. The finished jet looks very nice and slick. It looks like a high-end jet, and it's a vehicle that is designed to fly, so unlike the car, it fits the Future Flyers theme very well. Here is a look at it from the front. I really like the design of the nose as it cleverly uses the Mixels joint that I pointed out earlier to attach the second sloped wedge part upside down to the bottom of the jet's hull. It looks very good from the side as well. The only things that look a bit off are the gap between the wings and the top part of the plane and the holes in the fins of the jet that are created by the arches, but I don't mind them too much. It has two engines in the back which are constructed using the wheels of the car. I am very happy with how this model came out and I would really like it if it weren't for the play feature. The designers of this set decided to make this a variable wing jet which is not a bad idea as it adds playability. Usually, variable wing jets sweep their wings backwards to increase their speed. But for some reason they chose to base this model on the rare type of jets that sweep their wings forward instead of backwards. I had not even heard of this forward design before and I am not a fan of it. I would have much preferred it if they would have used the swept-backwards wing design which could have easily been done by attaching the wings from the back instead of the front. The wings in the back and the fins can be tilted up and down as well. Here is a comparison of the two flight modes of the jet. To me, the one with the wings folded forward just looks weird, so I'll keep them in their default state. The Robot Now it's time for the main attraction! This is the model I was looking forward to the most, so I saved it for last. You start the build by constructing the robot's torso. Next, you build the arms and legs which can get a bit repetitive because each pair is almost the same. Lastly, you add the jetpack, the head, and the shoulder pads. The finished robot looks quite impressive. He has the same color scheme as the Mindstorms NXT robots which suits him nicely. His design kind of reminds me of a Transformer, like a mixture of Starscream and Soundwave from Transformers Prime. Kinda makes me wish it could transform into a jet without rebuilding it, but Lego probably wont make Transformers anytime soon. That translucent blue dish in his chest is reminiscent of Iron Man's arc reactor. The figure has some interesting proportions with its large hands and feet and it short torso. The wings can be folded up so that they are level. I personally prefer them angled like on the box art though. They can also be folded all the way down for when the robot isn't flying. The jetpack is only attached by a Technic axle to make it easy to remove it if you so wish, however it is stuck in the robot's back so firmly that it is hard to remove it without breaking off a few pieces. Also, as you can see here, the two rockets are only attached by a clip hinge which allows them to be tilted a bit. Not sure what the point of this is, but maybe it's to make them easily removable as well. In addition to the jetpack, the robot also has jet engines built into his feet to help him fly even faster. You can see them in the following picture where he is enjoying a break. What? Even giant crime-fighting robots need to relax every once in a while. The sides of the robot's feet are open so that you can see the jet engines inside which adds some nice detail. Also, there is a red plate with a rail on each foot to keep the knees from bending too far forward. As you can probably tell, the figure is a bit back-heavy, so you may need to lean him forward a bit. This figure has quite a lot of poseability, especially in the arms. The wrists can turn, and the upper legs, shoulders, elbows, and even the head are on ball joints, so you can make a wide variety of poses. And thanks to the shoulder pads being on clip hinges, they are never in the way of posing the arms. Here is the robot taking a fighting stance. Unfortunately, like most Lego mechs, he is missing some articulation in his feet, so you need to balance him on the tips of his toes when spreading his legs. Despite the lack of a hip joint, you can also achieve the overused Iron Man pose: Or if you're more into DC, you can have him do the Superman pose when he's flying. Here is a comparison with Build-A-Buzz, another buildable figure with a jetpack. The robot is about the same size as Buzz (if you don't count the helmet), but while he doesn't have turning hips like Buzz, he has a lot more articulation in his arms and head. Honestly, I wish the Mixels would have come out before the Toy Story sets because Buzz's poseability would have benefited greatly from those small ball joints. Ratings Design: 4/5 - The designs of all three models are pretty good. The robot looks cool and stylish, the jet is sleek, and the car looks sporty. I do have some nitpicks about each of them, like the non-articulated feet of the robot or the reversed variable wings of the jet, and I still don't feel like the car fits the theme of the set, but I get why it's included. Build: 4/5 - The builds are satisfying. It's not too challenging and doesn't take very long, but there are some interesting techniques and the dismantling and rebuilding of the set into the different alternate models will keep you busy for a little while. Playability: 5/5 - I'd say this set is quite playable. The robot has some of the best articulation I have seen in a Creator robot and all three of the models are very swooshable. Parts: 3/5 - Like in most Creator sets, there aren't many rare pieces here, but they are all quite useful, especially for the type of futuristic MOCs that this set is meant for. Price: 2/5 - This is the weakest aspect of the set. $25 for 237 pieces is pretty high, especially for a Creator set. Overall: 4/5 - This set is pretty good as far as 3-in-1 Creator sets go. The main model is great and the alternate models are pretty good too, albeit nothing really special. And it comes with some nice useful parts to boot. The only downside is the price, but I hear that Target has it for $20 which is much more fair, so if you can get it there or at a sale, I'd say pick one up, especially if you're a fan of robots/mechs. I hope you enjoyed this EB Reviewers Academy review. By the way, does anyone else feel like this set was inspired by a certain Collectable Minifigure?"

It's good to see all three different designs and from your presentation, I reckon the robot version to be the best looking design. I am not really fond of the other two, but this robot is certainly pleasing especially when you are able to contrast it with the Buzz Construct a Mech."

The other 2 are just plain... It's good to see it's heavily articulated. And it totally has the S9 Battle Mech vibe. Nice review

I was not aware that this swept-forward wing design existed. Looking at the Sukhoi Su-47, the model does seem to be fairly accurate, but I'm still not fond of the design. Just my personal preference. And yes, the robot is clearly better than the alternate models, but that's to be expected from alternate models."

It is comprehensive and I think you've mentioned all important. I've already owned this set for a while so I built my own alternative model - polar bear. This set looks like the best all-purpose set in the latest years because it contains good enough parts for building almost anything.

I'm not saying alternate models are meant to be bad, I just think it's understandable when they are not as good as the main model since they are designed using the limited array of parts from the main model.

However, the alternate models ended up with a bunch of leftover parts. I hope future Creator sets would maximise the parts usage for all their alt modes . Leave no brick behind I'd say!

I still haven't made the purchase, but I think I may swing by Target today to pick it up when I do my other errands.

Here is just a bit of SB history for all of you profanes out there. Plankton owns the Chum Bucket. He is Mr Krabs? archenemy who constantly tries to steal the Crabby Patty secret formula in several episodes to run the Krusty Krab out of business. This set combines a few episodes such as the really fun: * Plankton: the very first episode that introduced the college educated Plankton. He takes control of SB by implanting something in his brain and makes SB to cook a crabby patty in order to put it in the chum?s bucket analyser... * Welcome to the Chum Bucket: During a card game with Plankton, Mister Krabs bets SB?s contract and looses !! He tries to be nice to SB in order to have the formula but that fails due to SB?s lack of cooperation. Plankton finally implants SB?s brain in his robot chef... * Plankton?s Army: This time Plankton disguises as a big grey robot (with a red tie) to try and steal the receipe which of course fails. He comes back with his ?army?... Now onto the set per se. I really think its a great set that combines cool building (that hand is so sweet), playability features and cool Mfs ! Its yet another must buy set for every SB fan. EZnjoy the review ;-) Like always, here are pics of the instruction booklet and the DSS (G there are loads of crappy stickers in that one !!) 1/ the MFs & extras That new printed SB looking stupider is fantastic !! It seems he doesn?t understand anything that happens around him: priceless :-D I just love Plankton with his war helmet trying to get away with robot legs installed on a crabby patty !! Note that fine ?bun? printing disc (a great part !!) The robots are kind of cool but they suffer from a major flaw: stickers !! (darn you TLC for putting so many stickers on your sets !!) As extras you have that kind of green tank (no clues to what its suppose to be though), a really cheesy ?catapult?, a plate, a dollar bill and a crabby patty 2/ the sweet Chum Bucket Sure it suffers from an overload of stickers (yet again >:-( ) but overall I really love that restaurant !!The shape is pretty nice, and the above hand really makes all the difference (BTW, I?m not sure the fingers should look like this X-D ). I think TLC did really a good job at making it ressemble a bucket (no Hinckie and Sinner, not that walrus bucket you guys always quarrel about :-D :-P ). Now lets focus on the interior?s playability and cool features. BTW, have you noticed the use of those dark blue pillars (4 of them !!). Lets start with a general pic of all those goodies. The entrance to the restaurant is really empty ? its normal there is nothing in there, they suffer from what is called the ?0 customers? effect loool. The only thing of interest is that ?tank? where our ?lost? SB is suppose to have the brain surgery hehe so in a way it looks like...lobotomy SB !! Look at his face, this is kind of an entry for kill SB X-D Now lets climb the ladder and see what we have !! * The crabby patty analyser (will Plankton finally learn the secret formula ? You decide !!) * Plabkton?s wife: the computer !! Seriously * the Robot chef activation beam ?its alive !!? I hope you enjoyed that review and stay tuned for tomorrow?s new review: Mrs Puff Boating School !! Plankton On !! *yoda*"

Here?s a review of this fantastic set. The box. Well, there?s nothing really special about it. The open box with three polybags. Note, that there are only three different colors used in that set (actually there are 4, but you can?t see the dark grey ones). Great color composition by the way. *wub* And - NO STICKERS !!! - :-D Oooops - I opened the bags too fast. Help me, I?m drowning! *sing* Not following the instructions, I built the wheels first to get the larger pieces out of the way. Keep on rolling. This is the load of the hopper waggon. 11 round bricks altogether. When I opened the set, I was curious if it was a new colored set or an old one. Luckily enough it was an old one, with old dark grey. I don?t know if TLC ever produced this set with bley. From the following pic you can clearly see, that the set is an old one. Look at these slope bricks. See what I mean? All bricks are looking exactly the same! Buy a set today means get at least three different textures on the slopes and maybe even more shades of tan. :-X >:-( I have said that in many other threads here and I?m saying it again: Back to the roots, Lego! You were able to produce good quality. Show us you can still do it! *sad* But now to the building. It?s a 6 x 24 train base plate you?re building on. Did I say I liked the colors? :-D This is the mechanism to unload the waggon. Built in the waggon with open gates... ... and with closed ones. Almost done. This is the first time, I realized that minifigs actually can step on those ladders. :-$ A short lift and the wheels are fixed. This darn mechanism! Wait, I?m coming with my monkey wrench! >:-) Who opened that door again? Do I have to do it all on my own? :'-( Finally the work is done. Now have a brake. One shot from the front/back. You can see the car is really huge! 8-? I put it behind the red car of the 4512. That sure looked very strange. *wacko* The set fits a lot better to the other cars of the ""My Own Train"" theme than to the older ones. The Score: Brick selection: 10/10 excellent color and brick selection (these were the days...) Playability: 9/10 great unloading mechanism Price/piece count ratio: 8/10 at peeron it says 20$, I got it for 39,95$ -> 30?/228 bricks. Not really cheap, but worth every cent! :-) Overall rating: 9/10 and a definity ""must buy"" for rolling stock lovers. Sad enough it?s not available on S@H any more. But there are still sets on BL and ebay. That?s for now folks, thank you for reading. I have some job to do..."

Lets look at our Bikini Bottom map and head strait to meet Miss Puff at her Boating school. She is waiting for us to give us a guided tour of her establishment ;-) Another bit of SB history: this set comes from the following episode: Boating School: SpongeBob fails his boating test for the 38th time (what a freaking retard lool). He's so determined to get his license that Patrick decides to help him. He implants a walkie-talkie inside SB?s head in order to cheat and tell him what to do. You will say that I am biais but I really enjoy building this set and I really like the SB theme !! Lets hope 2008 brings more of that cool spongieness !! But I digress... Here are general pics of the instruction booklet and the DSS (G there are loads of crappy stickers in that one also !!). As you can see the set is divided in 3 polybags. Shamelessly (but nonetheless wilfully hehe), I will disregard the third one which is that playability crap course !! I would have reviewed it but since it involves stickers, I didn?t want to ruin the parts and without stickers it would look dull, plain and ugly (it does look crappy with so imagine without), so that review will not be 100% complete and I do apologise in advance. But how many of you would have build that and keep it hehe Off :-P 1/ Mfs and extras I will start with the really cool Miss Puff *wub* (the fig mind you !!). She looks a bit stressed !! No wonder, that sponge menace will bring her to the hospital once again hehe. As you can see, that MF comprises 3 parts: the small blue 1x1 round and the 2 major parts. Yeay another great stupid looking SB. I love those idiotic faces !! 3 different SB figs and 3 idiotic faces hehe. You never can get enough of them !! Here is just a regular Patrick. Too bad Patrick doesn?t have different expressions ! The pull back boat car: nothing really to report (except the fact that I left it sticker free !!) The only thing I built from the third polybag is that pretty cool ancker holding tower thingie !! Looks great in a lighthouse set hehe. Yes the roud tile bouey is printed !! Its the same as in SB's bed in the Bikini Bottom set ;-) OK, its time for those two great buildings: the lighthouse and the school + pontoon !! Before reviewing them individually, here is a general pic. 2/ The lighthouse One of the main reason to own that great set !! Sure it suffers from accute stickeretite (sad but :-D ). T worst is that door), but nonetheless a great and simple building !! Great white/red colour scheme, and a really fantastic 2 turning lights !! I really like the yellow top of the lighthouse, it adds to the comic atmosphere of that theme instead of having a more plain red/white only. The rear has nothing really fancy, except tools to fix it in case of problems hehe. The only thing I modified since I didn?t build the third polybag is that I got rid of the trechnic parts on the right of the lighthoue to replace them with regular ?logs? All hail the tower King !! :-D 3/ The school and pontoon I really like that little building and its great to see that once again TLC uses the amazing dark blue color !! Its really a simple design but looks fantastic and can be used for many things in a town hehe I also really like the combination with those dark bluish grey slopes !! The rear reveals the desk, stickers on the wall (d?oh !!) and two clams serving as chairs (really like on the show). Its really great to see that TLC stays really as close to the show as possible. The pontoon again is simple yet really cool and effective. And its really nice to have 2 lifesaving boueys. The only thing I modified since I didn?t build the third polybag is that I got rid of the trechnic parts in front of the pontoon to replace them with regular ?logs? On the overall, I think its really a great set !! Apart from the crap stickers, I think TLC should have ditched (or simplified) the third playability polybag to lower the cost !! Oh well, parts are always usefull (except those one part shitty palm trees !!). So until my next review, I bid you farewell my Spongebob fans !! And I really hope to see next year hehe Will SB get his driver?s license one day ? For the sake of Bikini Bottom, lets hope not !! No license ever On !! *yoda*"

I wish Lego would go back to doing sets like these as I loved the multitude of instructions and ideas. The last batch of Creator sets had zero ideas, even though I know several were made. :'-( Anyway, less whining, more review. The lion is the main model. His mouth doesn't fully close, but it does open more. The head works well from most angles. I love the dark orange bricks; great for rust... He is quite solid, but the joints take the weight well. The neck goes side to side and rotates, but doesn't go up and down. The body is built in two parts and pinned in the middle. With what is left you can make what I think is a hyena, a silly plant MOC... ...and what I believe is a vulture. There are also instructions for a few other models including a bat, boar and a snake... which I quite like. He can be built at the same time as... ...this cute little lizard.

So I?m glad you did that for me. :-D I have different feelings about this set. On the one hand I love the lion. He is really impressive (even my wife -not known for being Lego enthusiastic- asked me, if there were more animals of this kind).

Here it is compared to a minifigure. Here's the back of the box. It shows all of the features from the set an ad for the video game. The back also shows a small picture with a silhouette of the dinosaurs from the line, along with their set numbers. Instruction Booklet The booklet shows the same thing as the front of the box, nothing more, nothing less. Near the back of the booklet, there is a picture with all of the characters from the sets. The other page shows all the dinosaurs with a mini box that shows the size comparisons. The Minifigures The minifigures in this set are Simon Masrani and an ACU. Both of them have excellent printing on the front and the back. The gun is the same one from TLM that the SSP used. Simon Masrani is the only one with a double sided face. His second face shows a scared/worried exp<b></b>ression. He has a zipped up jacket or jumpsuit with a shirt underneath. The ACU trooper only has one face which is a scared/worried exp<b></b>ression. I would have a scared exp<b></b>ression too if I was about to get eaten by a dinosaur. He has great detail on his torso and legs. Let's take a look at the vest. The vest is the same mold from the SSP in TLM I think. It has the letters ACU on the front too. The back is nothing interesting. Pteranodon The pteranodon has great printing too. The colors match the ones that the pteranodons from the movie have. The wings, mouth, and head are a rubbery type of plastic and are easily bendable. It uses the same mold from the pteranodon in the 2012 Dino line. Here's a comparison between the two. Spare Parts The spare parts aren't many, just a few extras. The Helicopter At first the helicopter was 'meh' when I first saw it on the box. Now that I've built it, I've got to say that I really like it. Its my favorite helicopter of all of the ones I've built. Its sturdy and sleek. It's not too bulky either. The first play feature in this set is the net launcher. It works pretty well, not one of my favorite features but it does what it's meant to do. The other play feature is on the other side. Its a stud shooter which can be used by a minifigure. You can put it on their hand or you can leave it there and let someone operate it. The shooter can fold up inside the helicopter as well. There are stickers on both sides of the helicopter and they also have the Jurassic World logo with Dino marks. Final Verdict Value: 9/10 - For $20 this set isn't that bad. The parts count is a little low for a $20 set but the price is probably because of licensing. Other than that, it's a great deal, I would've hoped for maybe some bait for the pteranodon but that can easily be fixed. Design: 9/10 - I REALLY love the way this helicopter looks, it's sleekness and design is great. The only flaw this has is the huge net launcher, it's too big in my opinion. Minifigs: 10/10[/b] - The minifigures are extremely detailed and it even includes an exclusive minifigure. Playability: 9/10 - There are many things you can do with this set. The swoosh factor is great and so are the play features. Parts: 10/10[/b] - They're useful parts and there isn't many huge specialized pieces in here either. Overall: 9/10 - This set is great for fans of Jurassic World, it's also a nice parts pack. There's one exclusive minifigure in here too which makes it even better. Having a little fun with the set Hope you liked my first review here on Eurobricks! Please leave any suggestions on what to improve, thanks! Edited by TheLazyChicken, 02 May 2015 - 10:19 PM."

Beside that the shop had a display of the JW polybags. For €3,49 I picked up two of them. Now here is my little review of this pretty nice set. First some data: Line: Jurassic World Year: 2015 Pieces: 29 Price: €3,49 Packaging: Polybag Ok, lets start with the polybag itself. It is a standard size and had plenty of room for all the parts. The front depicts the whole set with a little hexagon on the right with a seperate picture of the dinosaur and its name. In this case the Celophysis is called Gallimimus. Weird choice Next is the instruction sheet. It is a doublesided paper with every building step in clear sight. The part selection is nice. There are only a few but all of them are pretty usefull for all kind of builds. There are two parts which stood-out. Both are printed tiles. The first one is the yellow/black warning tile in 1x4. You can't have enough of that. The second one is a 2x2 tile with the Jurassic World logo on it. That's pure awesome. The bigger sets seem to have only sticker for that, so this little set is a perfect way to get hold of this nice tile. The leftovers. Nothing special. Here is the complete trap. It is a basic build and functions pretty well. In the end the parts are more interesting as the build so it will definitely end up as a parts-pack. Now on to the star of this bag. The Celophysis/Gallimimus. I don't know why Lego decided to call this dinosaur mold any different, but I think it has to do with movie-connection and the will to not produce a new mold. Nevermind, this figure is great and the colour is very bright and totally stood out. Pretty beastie. A comparison between the 2015 Gallimimus and the 2012 Celophysis. The final set in all its glory. Final verdict: It is a great little set. The parts used a nice and usefull. The printed tiles are the secret stars of this set and the dinosaur is fun two. With a few packs of these you could easily build a Celophysis pack with lots of Jurassic World signs on their way. Highly recommended."

For years, Lego has offered a house of some sort in the Creator line each year - with the standard Creator 3-in-1 instructions, that's given us a very wide variety of housing. In 2014, they added a business option with their 31026 Bike Shop and Cafe set. This continues into this year's Toy and Grocery Shop set. These shops are smaller than the very detailed modular buildings, but that should help them fit in better with the other City sets, and this also lets them get into more kids' cities with their lower pricetag. Name: Toy and Grocery Shop Set Number: 31036 Pieces: 466 Price: $39.99 Minifigs: 2 Theme: Creator Year of Release: 2015 Links: Bricklink Peeron Brickset The Box The front of the box shows the ""A"" version model out of the three, plus insets of the B and C versions. I like the sorta-European looking backdrop; it goes well with the styling of the buildings. Interestingly, the main model is shown opened up for play, while the two insets show those versions folded. The Box Top On the top of the box, Lego helpfully shows that with 3 of these sets, you can make a whole street. The Box Back On the back, you get to again see all three versions together, but this time, folded. It's a little creepy though with those clones running around :) The Manuals Yep, three actual, printed manuals. There's nothing indicating them as being A, B, and C models, but it's pretty obvious looking at the designs which is the ""main"" model and which are the alternates. The Contents Bags of parts and two plates. Nothing terribly exciting to see here.... The Minifigs Nothing new here, but two nice figs none-the-less. Well, Bricklink does say that both figs are unique to this set, but there's not any new parts to them. The closest thing to rare is the female head - it's only in this set, 2013's Dragon Mountain Castle set, a UK store grand opening set, and one of the 2014 Holiday freebie sets. The faces aren't that unique, but I guess this exact combo of two faces on the head is. I love the kid torso with the spaceman on it. The Minifig Backs No back printing on anything here except for an alternate female face. Sorry. I do like that her two faces are so different though. That's much better than when a head has a ""scared"" and a ""more scared"" face. The ""C"" Build Enough with the basics; let's build. I'm going to review them in the same order I built them, backwards. Since you can tell immediately looking at the 3 designs that they're going to use different numbers of pieces and so forth, I figured I'd build the smallest first lest it seem like a letdown. All three have some basic similarities - the two plates are hinged to give a building that opens for play. They also do have interiors, which you can see starting to form here. The ""C"" Build, Front It's a pretty quick build, so it's done already. Here's the front of the building with it opened up. Like this, it appears to be two separate stores, a newsstand and some sort of shop you can enter. All the printed tiles help give the newsstand a detailed appearance, but I'm not sure why they've got a $100 bill lying on the ledge... The ""C"" Build, Rear From the back side, the interiors are pretty plain. The shop half has a plant in a jar and a weird chair, and the newsstand just has a register. The ""C"" Build, Sides Here's the two sides of the folded building. On the hinge side, there's a bunch of windows in a disjointed wall with random colors. On the other, why did they put in a huge window when the set does include a trans-clear door that could have gone there? And you get a small patch of plants, like so many sets seem to have these days. The ""C"" Build, Extras That's a lot of leftovers there. And not just little stuff - multiple doors, stairs, etc. And unused sand green is always a little sad.... The ""B"" Build, 1 A pretty similar start, with the hinge and little garden and some tiles along the ground. The ""B"" Build, 2 Now we see a big windowed wall, some details like lights, and how it has the usual alternate model ""weird part usage"" - like a 1x4 brick with side studs being used over the doorway, even though those side studs will not get used. The ""B"" Build, Front The finished building gives us a nice little post office, with a letter-carrying bird on the roof. Hope that's not their normal method of delivery! Something about the colors just doesn't work for me though. The combo of white / light grey / dark grey / black / sand green plus tan is just too much. The tan window and door frames I don't like. The ""B"" Build, Inside On the inside, things are weird. The counter on the left is ok, but the light above the door (with a yellow clip? ugly!) is too big, and everything else over there by the door doesn't make much sense either. The ""B"" Build, Sides I like the front side here, except the colors are still too much. The bench, greenery, mailbox on the corner, and streetlight are all nice. The boy is a little creepy though - binoculars in hand PLUS a telescope on the roof of the post office? Why? The hinge side shows more of the weird colors you get in the wall, but that's going to be hidden when the set is open. Plus we even see that on big modulars at times, so it's not SO terrible. The ""B"" Build, Leftovers Again, a lot of leftover parts. It's obvious this was another alternate, but it'd be nice to see more of them used to make a bigger building. But let's move on to the model that DOES use them all... The ""A"" Build, 1 The first half starts like this. Maybe it's just my bias, but it already feels like a more detailed build. Bottles on the wall, the yellow and red awning over the window, etc. The ""A"" Build, 2 The other half starts off with detailed work too. I think that's a red vending machine. The stairs are also VERY solidly built. I also appreciate the effort to get that diagonal base where a door will be - it's such a nice touch to have sections of a building that aren't right angles. The ""A"" Build, 3 Not too much has been added, but I wanted to showcase the tiny toys before they get hidden by a wall. That robot and train are just fantastic little micro builds. The ""A"" Build, 4 Things are coming together quickly. The walls, windows, and doors get the first floor nearly done. I'm still not big on the sand green and tan combo, but I do really like the red and yellow awnings. The ""A"" Build, 5 It appears the shop owner lives upstairs, since we've got a bedroom forming here. The bed is a little plain, but the table and lamp on the other half are great. And my big fingers did not like putting all those railings on the balcony, with the telescope posts and tile tops. Knocked quite a few off before I got them all done. The ""A"" Build, Front And it's done. All the details make this set really feel like a mini-modular. The roofline has great greebling, and the shop contents, and on and on. It's not perfect though. The tiny car above the toy store door isn't nearly as good as the toys inside. And the kid's yellow scooter? The wheels aren't even on the ground, much less able to roll. The scooter looks decent though, so that counts for something. Well, at least as long as you are at this angle, since the boy's only got 1 foot on the 1 stud wide scooter. The ""A"" Build, Inside Most of the interior has been seen already. The roof though does a nice job of being interesting for a roof. A skylight, the edge rails, etc. And you can see there's not much ""wrong color"" in the walls. The ""A"" Model, Sides An interesting building when folded up. Very tall and skinny. You can tell it's not really meant to be displayed this way - it's meant to be open. The good - lots! I like the awning, the diagonal door, the flowerbox under the upper window, the folding gate on the balcony that lets it be used in open or closed mode, and the green / white / blue colors. The bad - well, the stairs end short of the upper door, I still don't really like the tan doorframes (I think black would have been better), and why don't the upper floors match up in size? The ""A"" Model, Leftovers Ah, that's more like it. Just a few small pieces left as spares. The Errors You might have to click through to the full-size versions, but I did catch a few weird errors in the manuals. First, in the photo of the newsstand, the map in the front corner is on there sideways. The map does have a clear north arrow printed on it. On the second image, the boy's feet are hanging off the edge. Just unusual to see an alignment error in the manual like that. The Comparison Here are this set and the modular Detective Office side by side. There's a huge difference - as you'd expect. But is the difference MORE than you'd expect? This set is 466 parts, $40. The DO is 2262 pieces and $160. 5 times the parts, 4 times the price. Looking at them side by side, I'd expect a bigger difference in both. The Conclusion So, what's my conclusion on this model? I love the main model, but the alternates are meh. It's a nice set for someone looking for a town building other than police and fire stations, but who isn't ready to move to the modular line. Compared to the modulars though, it seems overpriced. Part of that is because the huge modulars are actually a great deal compared to other Lego sets. I'm also a little surprised that it's so small, when you compare it to the City sets like a police station. Those are generally designed with much more open space, letting them be more of a playset. This one is small and cramped, so it'd be tougher to play in. It's not really a City set though. The Ratings Value: 7/10 - It's under the 10 cents a part mark, but that's largely due to having a TON of tiny parts. All those flowers and decorative 1x1 round studs add up quickly! Design: 7/10 - Good and bad on the colors, and there's a big difference between the quality of the main vs alternate models. Having so many leftover pieces is one thing when the Creator set makes 3 very different models (ie a boat, plane, and truck). When it's 3 buildings, it seems wasteful to have so many parts leftover. Minifigs: 6/10 - I'm not sure they both fit the set. I suppose the boy is going to the toy store and the woman is going to the grocery? But there's no storekeeper in either. The woman doesn't look like a storekeeper to me, so that's why I assume she's another shopper. I love the boy, but the woman is just so-so - except that I do appreciate the head having two very different expressions. But again, that doesn't fit the set. I can't see her scared face being used. Playability: 6/10 - The shops are detailed with registers and so forth, but it's all so tiny it'd be hard to play with the figs in it. Parts: 9/10 - Tons of windows and doors, plus nice sand green bricks. But some things (the large blue curves used on the roof for example) are weirdly specialized and would be hard to use in another building design. Overall: 7/10 - I'd recommend doing what I did - build the alternates first, then the main since that's how you'll want to leave it. I'd really like to see the price a little lower compared to other sets (again, the part count is inflated due to SO MANY tiny parts) and the finished building is tiny, but it's loaded with neat details."

It feels like a mishmash of bricks with no clear design aesthetic and as such blatantly underdeveloped (i.e. designed to hit a price/brick count point rather than provide a solid set in the Creator Town tradition). Compared to other Creator sets at this price point (31025 - Mountain Hut, for example) it feels utterly uninspired and ugly. Edited by Johnny6666, 04 May 2015 - 10:02 AM."

As I like many of the elements, I will probably buy a second one and build a mirror image version (making one entirely a toy shop and the other a book store/news stand) and adjust the sidewalks to work with the previous model. Then I think they will work well together. I remember a little area in Copenhagen that had this sort of architecture. I would hope the subsequent models are better deigned to create more complex alternatives, but these are both good starting points for original or enhanced models."

However, I think that Creator houses have long filled a niche that's neglected elsewhere: residential houses. We haven't had a larger residential house since 2013; I'm not sure if these sets have anything to do with that, but it seems like they may be the replacement for larger houses. And I'd much rather have a larger house set than a set like this. I also agree with many others here; something about it just feels incomplete. I think that the various City business buildings we've gotten in recent years (including those in this year's City Square--which is much more expensive than this, but also contains much more) make for better buildings at this scale."

I have to agree with those criticizing this set - it just feels unfinished, and it wants to be too much at the same time. Either throw in another 500 bricks and come up with something similar to Bike Shop & Cafe, or just build one smaller structure with the pieces in here. The building/interior sizes are ridiculous in the main model. They're supposed to be buildings, but have next to no interior space. From this review, I have to say that the C build works best for me when viewed just as a small kiosk. I really would've liked another set in the vein of Bike Shop & Cafe (bought two of those as a base for a future modular moc), especially with the sand green color, but this just doesn't seem worth it."

When the buildings are folded together the baseplates are all 16 studs wide, with a light grey baseplate bordered by dark grey tiles. The Toy & Grocery Shop may take up more space on the baseplate but these two sets are clearly intended to be compatible, just as the modular buildings always share the same dimensions and pavement style. And the modular buildings have at least four different architectural aesthetics, so it could be argued that they don't go together either. :)"

While the other builds aren't great, the main build is. Especially for the size class. Sure, building modulars is better, but I look at this as a mini modular. I put this up there with the bike shop and cafe rather easily. In addition, they work together rather well as well. That is how my son is using it. Personally I am looking forward to more creator sets of this sort. But I would like more houses as well."

Actually, it has almost twice as much pieces as the 31036 Beach Hut, but that doesn't seem to have been translated into any kind of bulk. I suspect that because of the nature of the set, none of the builds use all of the pieces at once. I'd love to see a revisitation of the 'Model' houses of years ago, but it would be very expensive to have a full-sized house AND fill it with the minifig furniture that all sets come with now. Just look at how expensive the Simpsons house was."

Ultra Agents are part of a fun filled action packed adventure. I have not done any Agents reviews before and it has always been my wish to do such a reviewing project. By now, you should be aware that the LEGO Agents Theme is solely conceptualised and developed by The LEGO Group (TLG). It first appeared in 2002 and was available till 2005 under LEGO Alpha Team. From 2008 to 2009, it evolved into a full fledged LEGO Agents Theme before it took a hiatus and came back full swing and was re-modeled as the new ongoing LEGO Ultra Agents from 2014 to 2015. For this review, we will be looking at this exciting vehicular truck trailer known as the 70165 Ultra Agents Mission HQ. Name: 70165 Ultra Agents Mission HQ Theme: LEGO System / Agents / Ultra Agents Year: 2014 Pieces: 1060 Minifigs: 5 minifigures Price: USD $99.99, GBP 79.99, EURO 99.99, SGD $179.90 Resources: Brickset, BrickLink LEGO Official Shop@Home Description said: Stop Terabyte stealing top-secret plans from Mission HQ!

This is the largest set of the LEGO Ultra Agents Theme in 2014. I am fond of the black and transparent blue glass combination which is kind of suitable for covert operations. Well, I was quite attracted to the design of this set as it reminded me of the 1980s M.A.S.K cartoon. The 70165 Ultra Agents Mission HQ is the second similar release of a vehicular truck trailer and is also based on the first 8635 Mobile Command Centre. Between the two sets with different primary colour schemes, both have their own unique capabilities of dealing with different threats such as Dr Inferno and Terabyte and yet they have similar functions such as hi-tech prison cell, small launch vehicles and defending mechanisms. You may notice that the 70165 Ultra Agents Mission HQ has evolved into a much hi-tech operating environment as they are now dealing with more dangerous and sophisticated villains. The content of the sealed box The sealed box comes with seven mint packs and eight black tires. The seven mint packs are numbered and printed from one to seven, a dreaded sticker sheet and two instruction manuals to guide the builder to build up the set. The instruction manuals are packaged in a sealed plastic together with the dreaded sticker sheet and paper cardboard to support the manuals from being crumpled so easily. After building the set, these are the remaining generous spare parts which are spread across the packs. You can view the spare parts for packet 1 including an orange brick separator, packet 2, packet 3, packet 4, packet 5, 6 and packet 7. This set also encourage the builders to download the free LEGO Ultra Agents application for the ultimate digital experience, i.e. you can use the official set to interact with the application by enable yourself to become the agent for added value fun. To be honest, I haven't messed around with the application but I heard it somehow could tell or construct a story plot of some kind. The full minifigures range in this action packed set In the next few sections below, we will look at LEGO minifigures that come with this set. You will get five minifigures with individual character personality and one of which is the main villain of this set. Before I show you the minifigures in greater details, you may take a quick glance to view the back view of the full minifigures range in this action packed set. Do note, these minifigures are placed in different allocated packs. Terabyte, Agent Curtis Bolt and Agent Caila Phoenix Upon opening the first packet, I was actually sorting out the minfigures parts and to my surprise I am able to assemble three minifigures at one go. The minifigures are Terabyte, Agent Curtis Bolt and Agent Calla Phoenix respectively. The sole villain in this set is known as Terabyte. He is a highly intelligent computer savvy person whom has gone down the wrong path and is very capable of hacking and causing chaos to the city’s computer systems. He wears a black jacket with neon similar lime green tee-shirt which features a computer virus illustration at the front, while the back reveal wordings like ""BAD 2 THE CODE"". A mixed message which can be seen from their back view of these three minifigures. Through his side view, Terabyte wears a sophisticated looking headgear equipped with a cyber hacking blaster that contain a printed keyboard tile at the side. It appears that it has some sort of destructive function that could modify the source code at his whim. The first character of the good side which we are introducing is Agent Curtis Bolt. He is the de facto technological inventor in the Ultra Agents Team. He is clever and tech-savvy. If any of the agents' equipment or devices is broken, he can rectify and fix it and even probably add in a couple more value added features into it. Although Agent Bolt appears in other sets like the 70163 Toxikita's Toxic Meltdown and 70168 Drillex Diamond Job, his outfit in this set is unique. He is donned in the black suit attire and is equipped with a high zoom calibrate goggles. The second character from the good side which we have is the femme fatale Agent Caila Phoenix in the typical Series 1 Nurse hairstyle in a much striking appearance. She is a martial art combatant and a demolitions expert. Her flair for both combined with a fiery temper has made her a valuable asset in the team configuration, well 'most' of the time. Similar to Agent Curtis Bolt above, she only appears once in this particular attire. Other than this set, Agent Caila Phoenix is also seen in 70164 Hurricane Heist and 70170 UltraCopter vs. AntiMatter. In this set, we see her in action with the jetpack. It looks easy to operate as what she has prepared and willing to demostrate in this jetpack even though I am not sure of its operating stability upon activation. Agent Solomon Blaze The next character which we are getting from the third packet, is the Ultra Agents' leader, Agent Solomon Blaze. He has a very interesting background. His name sounds familiar and I found out that he has actually appeared in the Galaxy Squad and he is the leader of the Blue Squad (as seen in the left side of the picture). As you have seen in both pictures, Agent Solomon Blaze is much younger when he was leading the Blue Squad and that happened during the space futuristic era and I thought this current set happened in a time where Galaxy Squad had not exist yet. Instead, this Agent Solomon Blaze who is much older and wiser now, make the whole story plot appears that it happened right after Galaxy Squad era and now he is in the hi-technology metropolitan Astor City environment. Not sure if it is intentional but I thought this is an interesting fact to know. Under LEGO.com, his short bio only mentioned, ""The former pilot and wing commander Solomon Blaze, was cherry-picked to head the Ultra Agents. His unfaltering determination inspires courage on the ground as it did in the air. After all, leadership is leadership."" Like the rest of the minifigures, he also appeared with dual emotion. Unlike the other agents, Agent Solomon Blaze appeared in the same outfit and design in another two sets and they are 70162 Infearno Interception and 70170 UltraCopter vs. AntiMatter. Professor Christina Hydron Let's bring you to the last of the minifigures which is also coincidentally found in the last packet and is none other than Professor Christina Hydron. She is the only exclusive minifigure in this biggest set of the LEGO Ultra Agents 2014. Professor Christina Hydron render back-end support with her core competency in laboratory analysis and deducing clues given by the agents during field operations. Her job in the laboratory enables the agents to solve important cases by following up on leads resulting in major breakthroughs. Although she will be wearing safety goggles most of the time, but from time to time, she does remove it off as you can see almost all of her facial features. The entire building content for Packet 1 The completed built for Packet 1 The completed built for Packet 1 includes the three minifigures mentioned earlier, Terabyte’s mech and hidden flyer which are meant to be a form of appetizer before beginning the actual built of the starry set. The Ultra Agents have created the autonomous hidden flyer to provide tracking of targets remotely such as this positive demostration. The hidden flyer is equipped with dual cannons and does not allow any passenger to take position from the inside. In the later section of the review, we will see the location of where the hidden flyer is kept. Now let's look at the main focus of this packet which contains the various playabilities that the yet-to-built mech can provide. The completed built of Terabyte's mech The finished mech is controlled by Terabyte. I suspect it is autonomous to some extent since he is a genius hacker and probably set it to automatic mode from his mech's control panel if required. Both mechanical arms are designed to be equipped with nasty features that could really harm the Ultra Agents. The left arm contains a huge metal looking spinning claw by turning the small rod. It is able to grab any agents that obstructs him. While the right arm contains a destructive hacking bomb ball shooter. You are able to shoot and release the hacking bomb ball by activating in such a manner. The back of the mech reveals the ability to deploy a detachable surveillance drone. Agent Curtis Bolt is trying to take down Terabyte The entire building content for Packet 2 The completed built for Packet 2 The completed built for this packet shows the finished foundation base of the truck driver's cabin. It encompasses various bricks and technic parts to form its base and dimensions. The entire building content for Packet 3 The completed built for Packet 3 This packet and the earlier packet combined to complete the construction of the stunning truck driver's cabin. The overall anesthetics design is very appealing due to the appropriate usage of black bricks and transparent blue parts on the cabin , wheels and headlight together, as seen in the front view, bottom view and side view. The driver's cabin also contains some good playable features. By opening up the rooftop of the driver's cabin, you can place the driver to control the movement of the entire vehicle. In this case, Agent Solomon Blaze is the suitable candidate. The newly reactive missile shooters are integrated with the design and it can be launched at the front of the truck driver's cabin by moving the shooting mechanism to launch both missiles simultaneously. The back of the driver's cabin reveal the actual placement of the hidden flyer. It can be easily launched by pulling it upwards and off it goes to hunt for the target. For your information, the hidden flyer wings can be adjusted. The entire building content for Packet 4 The completed built for Packet 4 The finished built from the fourth packet reveals the foundation of the Ultra Agents Mission HQ truck trailer. It forms the base of the headquarters and some of the essential facilities is also being added on. The entire building content for Packet 5 The entire building content for Packet 6 The completed built for Packet 5 and 6 Both packet 5 and 6 focus on the building of the sides of truck trailer to form the entire truck trailer mainframe. Each packet form one side of the trailer side and by flipping to the other side, it reveals the exterior side of the truck trailer. The corners of the exterior side enables the flaps to adjust and enclose itself partially. Putting both sides of the trailer exterior together The entire building content for Packet 7 The completed built for Packet 7 By putting in the last touch in this final packet, voila! You will be appreciative of the complete functional working Mission Headquarters for the Ultra Agents to carry out their operatives through the usage of the laboratory, prison cell and mini buggy. All of these are shown in greater details below. Take a moment and close up all of the action in the Mission HQ. Just admire the fine design of the completed built of the truck trailer. Through various vantage points, the truck trailer can be seen in greater details from the top view which includes the satellite dish, bottom view which includes the trailer stopper, front view and back view. After opening the back doors, you can take a quick glimpse inside and you will see it is pretty packed to the brim. Alternatively, you can also open the top cover to reveal the aerial view of the inside of the truck trailer being in stasis mode. As mentioned, some of the key playabilities in this set include the quick deployment of the buggy with just a simple push. The Mission HQ contains a jetpack hoist to alleviate the suit up process. The computer laboratory is an useful place for the Professor Christina Hydron to work and analyse the critical clues. The computer mainframe is the crucial equipment which is supported by the satellite dish. The agent will upload the mission briefing materials onto the laptop and assigned agents will be sitting down in the briefing area to view the large screen which contains the mission brief. Last but not least, when the mission is successful, you will see the deserving villain being locked up in the prison cell. The completed built of the entire 70165 Ultra Agents Mission HQ There is a huge mech blocking in the front Let's distract Terabyte Terabyte is on the loose The full action packed transformation set up To conclude, I like the design of this set and I applaud the designer for being able to integrate the great playing features into the trailer. When I opened it up, I had the feeling of opening up a pop-up book. I like the cool colour scheme which makes the whole Ultra Agents look so united under their corporate colour. More importantly, it is fun to play this set on its own without owning other sets in this theme to enhance the experience. However, I have not built my 8635 Mobile Command Centre but I will love to put them side by side in the future. Not sure which will fare well and this is why I am seeking Eurobricks Community on their preference between both sets. All in all, I have a positive experience building and playing with the flagship set of the Ultra Agents 2014. Summary review Playability: 8/10 (Plentiful fun playing features which could integrate with your own story plot.) Design: 8/10 (Excellent design work and choice of colour scheme to represent the secret operating mobile headquarters.) Price: 8/10 (Price is a bit high but still cheaper than LEGO licensed sets.) Overall: 8/10 (Get this set if you are a huge fan of LEGO Action Themes and fan of transforming truck trailer.) I gave it a ""4"" based on my Review Score Card. What about you? I hope every one of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. Comments and Criticisms are welcomed. Pictures can be found in My Flickr."

Even though I voted for this one, the 8635 set was a huge step forward for Lego and more iconic - for me it's the one set I would choose that really marked the start of a huge improvement in sets and theme development."

I wish I could return in time ... this is really the set that I would have loved when I was 10 years old. I did however vote for the Mobile Command Center (2008) to be a better set... but this is just due to its color scheme as I really like Dark Blue. I would love to see some future reviews of the new Ultra Agents sets, especially from a top reviewer as you!"

On its own, it's certainly a fantastic set... but because of its subject matter and theme, it's hard not to compare it to 8635 Mobile Command Center. And while this may have a sturdier and more aesthetically pleasing build, the Mobile Command Center is exceptionally hard to match in terms of content. This set includes an ATV, small plane, command station with screen, crane and prison cell. That's cool and all, but the classic set had all that plus another ATV, a boat, a jet-ski, and many, many more hidden weapons. Plus, even some of the features that were carried over are more aesthetically interesting but less functionally so. The Minority Report-style computer screen may look much more modern than the classic Command Center's somewhat dated projector, but a projector makes for a much more novel function than a simple stickered computer screen. The glowy prison pod in this set looks cool, but lacks the functionality of the classic prison cell, which allowed the back wall to be removed to break Dr. Inferno out of captivity (not to mention that the new one somewhat oddly folds up sideways when the truck body is closed, which can't be comfortable for the captive Terabyte). Most of this is probably nostalgia talking—I'm not normally one to look at past themes through rose-tinted glasses, but the classic Agents theme was perhaps my favorite Lego theme of all time, and the Mobile Command Center was one of the standout sets of the theme. I'm sure this set is just as amazing for new fans as the classic Mobile Command Center was for me, but for me this new set might never quite scratch that itch."

Lyichir, it is interesting to hear your take between the both sets. I have both of this but just that I have not built to compare. You are right. The 8635 Mobile Command Center is a classic take to this ultimate transformation of vehicle to a base. I could said both have their own individual appeals. Well, I am now urging to look for my mint box and build it up, just to experience the actual fun and differences."

I think the original Agents Mobile HQ is the better set, but I am glad that this set is a cabable and competent successor. This set is fantastic, and packs the play features in! It also features a great vehicle-mode without getting too similar to the build of the original Agents HQ. I have them parked near one another, and was indeed considering rebuilding this set in the original Agents color scheme, but it turns out that those Technic panels in Dark Blue are pretty costly. Also, I enjoy that this set comes with a mech for Terrabyte to stop around in, rather than GoldTooth's minijet from the 2008 set."

Full of play functions and would also look nice on display. My only gripe would be I feel that 5 figs is a bit short for a set of this size and price. Another 2, even if they were generic 'robot baddies' would really tip this into the 'outstanding' category for me."

I'm also a bit disappointed by the low fig count, less because of the value of the set and more because it connects to another way I preferred the original Agents theme. The classic theme is what I'd consider maybe the most triumphant example of ""sets telling a story"". With that in mind, the Mobile Command Center's larger number of figs offered much more storytelling potential. There were enough seats for all four Agents to be hard at work, and enough vehicles for all four to leave the truck for missions, and the story didn't ""end"" when Dr. Inferno was captured—rather, the set also included Gold Tooth and Spy Clops so that they could break him out of prison! This set includes the same number of agents as the classic set, but only half as many small vehicles for them to use. And even with a giant mech, Terabyte is just one villain, and once the threat he presents is neutralized there aren't many other play scenarios offered by this set alone."

As a general statment, I think that tank is really cool and the figs are great BUT I disliked the build. First way too many tread parts and then way too many technic parts (I know, I'm not a Technic fan). Also the boring part is the tread and you have to build that twice !! Oh well, enough rambling and lets start with the instruction booklet and puny DSS !! I/ MFs and extras Lets start with our jolly Riddler and his jetpack. The Riddler is just the same as the one from the Asylum and his jet pack is simple and cool. Now onto that badass of Bane !! Talk about muscles and SM mask. Now that really cool dark blue Batman !! And here are pics of the happy familly. The dirt bike is really awsome but the configuration of that set is crap !! On the right a huge gun and on the left two missiles !! G it looks like Exo Force mods here !! Nothing fantastic at all. Also, I kind of like the idea of a third wheel but with a side car and not that !! So enjoy the pics before I dismantle the whole thing !! That dirt bike looks fantastic !! Feast you eyes on the baby. I really like the fact that its greaty proportioned compared to that new speed bike. Come on TLC, bring us some more dirt bikes !! Maybe that Indy set will have this dirt bike in dark bley or black ? II/ The gate That is really the crap part of that set. I built it for the review but will dissemble it after for parts !! No way I?m keeping that crap which increased the retail price. I didn?t use any of the stickers too. Nothing really interesting there but I look at close ups of the light and gattling gun. There are some cool parts though !! Also here is a close up of the puny extras. At least there are 2 bills & a cool reddish brown chain !! III/ The Batank Ah, now the ?pi?ce de resistance?: the glorious Batank 8-? . I think that tank is really incredibly cool looking (even if boring to build). Its really sturdy and the best part is that it rolls really smoothly due to the construction of those treads (well played TLC !!). And the best part is I don?t want to mod it (for once !! yeayyy). I?ll start with overall pics of the beast *wub* Now here are details of the side panels. I didn?t use the 2 stickers though (except the bat one). Now lets focus on the cool front part. Sure its simple, but it makes the beast look mean. Here are great uses of that 1x1 slope. Now lets move inside the cockpit: there is nothing too fancy about it: just a printed tile. Very simple indeed !! Now to finish, lets focus on the rear part where the ?catapult? is. The top reveals those two firing crappy missiles. It looks okie but not fantastic. At least it brings a touch of colour on a dominent black vehicle. The catapult is attached only by 1 pin, which allows it to move up and down. Warning, watch out when you place it up because the firing mechanism is quite sensisitive. Don?t shoot yourself with it X-D I hope you enjoyed that review and until next time, I bid you adieu !! Bat On !! *yoda*"

No! X-D Batman has been blue for most of his life, and it was one of the few things that the old TV show got right. Tim Burton went for black to get away from the past and it kind of stuck. I think some comics have done grey with a black cape, cowl and gloves sometimes, and that could be why you got confused."

So i see TLC continue to give us stickers instead of printed parts :-| , i can't tell you how much i hate stickers and after seeing that great Bane wanted poster i feel cheated out of a beautiful printed piece. The Riddler's jet pack is simple yet has a certain appeal about it, i like it alot better than i expected i would. Wow!!! That Bane is simply stunning 8-? , i wasn't sure at first about him but after seeing all the print on the back i have to say a big well done TLC!!! He's amazing and i hope TLC continue the trend. The new blue bat helmet is nice though i do prefer the black version, still it's nice to have a choice. Ohhh that new dirt bike is beautiful, i think ill keep it as a bike only and get rid of all that side car crap. Like most people have pointed out what's the damn point of those gates? They guard nothing!!!!! TLC should of included something behind them, but no it seem's that had to cut corner's. Now onto the best part the batank!!! This badboy look's amazing, there's not alot i can add to that it just make's this set all the more important to all of us bat fan's out their! Im not a great fan of the tread's either as i found them really annoying on the sandcrawler but their's not alot i can do about them. The cockpit will need mocing but thats a pleasure to do, it's a shame TLC included all the extra yellow bit's but they can be removed. For me this set is a must, though i doubt my bank balance will like it X-D Batank on!!!"

The cape and cowl were black for his first appearance, then around the sixties it started to change and the cowl became blue with black highlights and the yellow oval appeared. Then the 70s Batman was blue with the yellow oval (not represented in the set) and this became the classic 'old style' Bat-suit. Then the whole Bat-suit became black for the films, and around 1999-2000 the cape and cowl became black in the comics and the yellow oval disappeared. Save for a few appearances by the ble Bat (Batman & Son, JLA #0) the costume is predominntly coloured black. I have to say, nice as the blue Bat-suit is, I think I prefer the black cape and cowl with the grey suit. Anyway, onto the set. I'm definitely getting this, once I can actually find it in the shops that is. If not, I'll just order it from S@H. I'd imagine the treads would be immensely boring to assemble. There'd better be something good on TV then. The 'hideout' will have to go, but I'm sure I can find a use for the pieces in my Batcave, which'll have to be changed again to accomodate the two new Bat-vehicles. The gun on the tank will probably go too, and the tank will function more as a heavy Batmobile. The bike will lose it's guns, as I love the dirt bike and want to be able to see it in all it's glory. And that Bane fig is *wub*"

Bane is very impressive, no other way to put it. Riddler, not so much so, since he's a repeat, but fine. That dirt bike is great. I bet we can expect a dark bley one out of Indy and other colours could appear in City somewhere. No way they'd make that and not use the heck out of it. Based on what they did to that one, maybe Exoforce too. Fence/gate/wall/base/haha/wth. The less said the better. *n* Bat Tank, battank, batank. Bat Tank. Looks pretty good, I can see putting it together and leaving it alone, and I can see it making a dupe of this set worthwhile. Yeah, careful with that cannon, you'll shoot your eye out kid *pirate with eyepatch* ;-) Kind of wish we had a couple of walls inside that gate, but hey, they wasted enough money on those parts, better to see more go towards the main attractions anyway. Could have used a henchman, at least one for the Riddler. Figure after 2 sets, that's the last we'll see of him, so I guess I'll have to look up what they normally dress like and custom one up. Much as Scarecrow won't get one (I can't remember anything about him, so I don't even know if he'd have henchmen, nor do I know if Bane would).

This year, one of the more colourful sets appearing in the line is Rainforest Animals. Let's take a look! Set#: 31031 Name: Rainforest Animals Theme: Creator Year: 2015 Pieces: 215 Minifigs: None MSP: U.S.$14.99 Peeron Brickset Bricklink The box The box is nothing surprising, the main model, with the two alternates on the side. At a glance, the shades of green used are really attractive. It jumps out off of the shelf, especially compared to a lot of the other Creator sets, which tend to have a lot more sky blue shown. The back of the box shows the 'action' features, such as they are. They will be shown in depth as the review goes on. The booklets The books have images based on the box set. They are cleanly designed with the requisite ads and piece list in the back. The Pieces The set is relatively small, and outside the googly eye printed pieces, nothing was particularly surprising. I love the colours though. The greens are lush. Build One: the piraña The base of the fish is solid, no hollow space in this build. The set(s) uses pieces in an unusual way in places. The bridge of the nose at the front uses two of the pivoting pieces that are normally used for doors and such are stacked and used only to get a nice texture to the front of the fish. Those sorts of irregular piece usage separates professional Lego builds from amateur ones. And a few steps later, it's finished! It's not a complicated build, but it is very, very economical and polished. The fins are solid and don't flop around. The base is stable, it won't fall over. I like the curves on it. It cuts a nice silhouette. And one from behind, for completionists. Build Two: Chameleon The second build is the chameleon. The base of it is solid as the piraña is. It's quite a chunky thing. I think the colours are a little more random than in the piraña, but nature is like that, and the three shades of green play well off of each other. The legs are put on, and I think they work better than they should. The feet are just stacked corner pieces. It works though, and they are very stable. The ability of the head to tilt is smartly restricted. It keeps it from going to unnatural positions. An unused hinge keeps it from flopping down too much. This is my favourite model of the three. It's got a funky quality to it. Build Three: Parrot/frog/fly The fly is a very simple build, and cute too. Next is the frog. Again, not too many steps. The hinged back feet are a clever design. The final frog is pretty nice, and has one action feature: A gaping maw. The shape of the big green slope is very close to an actual frog's shape. Could that be its original purpose? The third build is the parrot. At first I was a little baffled by it. Where is everything going to go? Unlike the other two, this thing is hollow... But there is a purpose for this! Turns out the next step solves a little mystery. The horizontal set is turned up, and feet are put on. The next steps build a very well designed head, that snaps on top. This kind of reminds me of the parrot from those Three Caballeros cartoons. Anyway, he's built, and he's a beaut. Of the three, this definitely uses the colours the best. The wings look surprisingly organic, and can splay out like a real bird's might. And go back. This is the weird thing. The head tilts back so you can feed it, as seen on the box. The set comes with four little beige pellets. So why was the inside hollow? Well, the tail pops up and... The bird poops? I guess that's what they're going for. It's interesting, anyway. So that's the third build. It uses a majority of the pieces, and is the one with the most natural colour scheme. The Final Verdict Design: 10/10 I have to review this on what it is: a set under $15 with multiple builds. It's not mind blowing, but nowhere in the set does anything rub the wrong way. The proportions seem right, except possibly the fly. Build: 7/10 It's not boring, but it's not anything I've never done. The parrots feet are interesting, and I like seeing the snot techniques in the build. Playability: 8/10 The fish isn't playable at all. But the piraña, parrot and frog are posable. And kids love things with pooping action. Price: 10/10 I thought this was $30 at first, but upon checking, no, it's $15. I thought $30 would be reasonable, but at $15, it's a good deal. And I love all the colourful, curved slope pieces in the set. Overall: 9/10 This is a solid set, not a must have, but a set that shows what a creative, smart toy Lego can be, away from licenses and flick fire missiles. I would recommend this as a present for any young person. So, it's good. My personal favourite build was the chameleon, and my daughter liked it too, using it as a dragon to fight with Mario, until she smashed it into oblivion. It unlocked her imagination, and that's what this stuff is all about, right?"

It took me 2 hours to build with a sedated pace. There are 4 instructions manuals, two for each model The bags with 1 lets you build most of the frame After 2 you get the rest of the frame and the bed 3 Gives you the crane and fuel tanks, while the cab is made using the bags with 4. Functionality Being a medium sized Technic model, I expected a lot of functionality. This model gives you: - Working steering with the knob on the tilting cab. The ideal solution which beats the rear mounted steering wheel of the fire truck 8289. - Rear suspension. This is done using a bogie like on many other LEGO models. I expected something more special when reading the description of this ""off road truck"" - Winch. Extremely simple, but uses a technic pin with friction for... friction which is compact and nice. - Tipping cab. And what is beneath the cab in a truck? Nothing! Last time I saw a tipping cab without an engine beneath was the truck from 8062 in 1994. It had a mechanism for tilting the cab and the excuse of being a secondary model. - rotating crane with 2 joints. The upper joint is operated from the top of the crane which is a solution that makes the crane less fun to operate. I think all the functions should be controled remotely. If that requires pneumatic, then so be it. - Tipping bed. The bed tips by turning a knob on the side. It works well and you can tip the side panels up if needed. Design The only things I really love in this model are the fuel tanks. They look very good. The rest of the truck is pretty average. The interior is pretty much a copy of 8289, the bed is placed very high, but the proportions are good. The stickers are all on single pieces and are numbered to make the build even easier. Conclusion - Price: 6/10. Priced nearly identical to the Crawler Crane. Cheaper than 8289, but no real bargain. - Functionality: 4/10. I miss an enigine with working pistons and the steering on top of the crane drags the score down. - Design 6/10. It doesn't look bad, but not great either. There isn't much off-roading in the rear bogie and many of the ideas have been seen before. - Secondary model: 4/10. It is pretty much like the main model, but uses the crane base to connect the two halfs in the middle. An interesting suspension, but resembles the primary too much for my likings. - Modifiability: 4/10. It would probably not be hard to motorize it, make a better suspension or modify the crane to use pneumatic. Modifications like that would however almost make a new truck and then I would rather just play with the 8868 Airtech claw rig or 8828 crawler crane. Overall it is pretty much like 8289 regarding both functionality and design. It has slightly better functionality, but is really only average which leads me to the conclusion that this set is average in every way - There is nothing to set it apart, but nothing really bad either. - Final score 5/10. Better than 8289, but for the price I will recommend a crawler crane instead. (BrickShelf gallery)"

You have convinced me that I only want this set on sale. It seems to be an odd year for Technic; most sets seem average except the Bulldozer. The crawler crane is on it's way to me now; it is still available for Australia and that is probably why we can't buy this set yet. The biggest reason for me to buy this set is for the wheels. Very disapointing the complete lack of a drivetrain. :'-( (Any chance of passing on the instuction book codes?)

Parts selection Spare parts The completed build The figures, from left to right, the SHIELD Agent, Spider Man and Carnage. First up, Carnage The printing on this figure is brilliant, and I was happy and surprised to see printing on his arms too. It's a shame that the back printing is covered by the neck bracket. Time for our hero, Spider Man When I saw the preliminary pictures of this set, I wasn't too sure about the figure. Now that I've got him in person, I take it all back. The figure is very faithful to the tv version, for once plain legs and arms are correct. The front and back printing is excellent, including the muscle definition. My only complaint is that Lego still haven't figured out how to print on the entirety of the head, the gap between front and back head printing is a little off-putting, but not horrible. (The only figure that really suffers from lack of side head printing is Nick Fury) Now for the SHIELD Agent Again, he features very nice printing, yet I was disappointed that his arms are plain, why did the arms from Maria Hill not get used. He would look a lot nicer with the SHIELD logo on his arm in my opinion. Lastly, it's the little SHIELD hovercraft. I love this little thing, its 100 times better than the build from Iron Man vs. Ultron. I can imagine having six of these flying around a Helicarrier with Venom and Carnage attacking them all. The small 2x2 round tiles with the fan printing are lovely and I can see those, plus the SHIELD Agent being a good enough reason to pick up multiple copies of this set. The characters have a few flaws but these are personal opinions, and hardly detract from the set at all. I would take this over the larger Spider Man set released this year any day, yet I'm in it for the figures so I'll probably stilled up getting that one too. Hope you've all enjoyed my second review on here, and please feel free to add any additions to this review that you have!"

I do also wish that the SHIELD agent had Maria Hill's arm printing. Either way, I will use the agent's torso and legs for Nick Fury. Also, I will give Carnage some black hands, I think he could use some more black. Also, great review."

I'd go so far as to say Bane from Dark Knight Rises would actually benefit from all around head printing even more than Fury. With that said, the set looks decent enough for the price. I will pick one up for sure to pad my collection. I don't know anything about this version of Spider-man."

"Dannaher, Danny Nick",,http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?s=48234f9c48b5f5548bccef2e6b2ffe4c&showtopic=110897&#entry2245583,"Firstly I’d like to mention the biggest controversy with this set. It had been delayed for about two weeks here in the UK due to a production problem. The friction between the Technic pieces and the legs of the ant model were very loose. The updated sets have extra ‘2M Cross Axle W. Groove’ and ‘Nose Cone Small 1X1’ for each leg to make them more stable and it’s a successful change. I did try and use it without those two addition pieces (how it was originally produced) and they were not strong enough to hold the model with a little pressure on it, it would just want to get squashed. Nothing else was changed besides the instructions; the boxes are the same, without any changes, It’s hardly noticeable. I’m not sure if this is the same case for the U.S. as they have been available there since the June 1st release date. I’m not sure it they would go up in value or not. The Brick Fan has a picture of the two different instructions manuals for anyone who is still curious: http://www.thebrickf...tle-76039-issue When I first heard that that a set would be produced based on Marvel’s Ant-Man film I was shocked like many others because LEGO only releases sets based on one Marvel movie per year as shown in recent years ever since the ‘Super Heroes theme has been around . I hope that this trend continues in the future. So next year we would have an entire wave based on ‘Captain America: Civil War’ and at least one set based on ‘Doctor Strange’ around the same price as this set. It is a shame that LEGO never produced more sets based on the ‘Ant-Man’ movie, it has much more potential but I guess it could have got overloaded like the ‘Avengers: Age Of Ultron’ sets. Packaging Once again we have the Marvel Super Heroes banner across the top of the box which has the Ant-Man picture on the top right hand corner. The artwork showing the set is great as Ant-Man comes to the rescue to stop Yellow Jacket throwing screws and LEGO bricks across the floor or table. I would just like to point out that if this is indeed the final battle in a kid’s bedroom as the trailer suggests, then why on earth are there loose screws? Sometimes designers could have poetic licence so that may be the reason why. The bottom right has the movie logo as well as showing you the Minifigures included in the set. The new addition of the super jumper graphic makes it seem like only two Minifigures are included and they are showing you the ant-man Minifigure again as an example since the Ant-Man and Hank Pym figures are very similar in design. Minifigures This set contains three exclusive Minifigures: Ant-Man, Yellow Jacket and Hank Pym. The Ant-Man (Scott Lang) Minifigure’s printing is spot on in comparison to the movie however it could have easily had arm printing. The main problem I have is the helmet, in the movie it’s completely covered hoover in this set it looks like they when between the comics and the movie with the mouth opening. I personally think it could have been how early LEGO designs these sets. Not many people know that the studios send them early concept art which is why some scenes that sets depict which don’t appear in the final cut of the movies because changes were made in the production of the movie. These toy and product designs are done way before the movie is even filmed. Another problem with this set is the reuse of existing Minifigure heads in this case its Ezra Bridger’s head from Star Wars: Rebels. The printing on Yellow Jacket (Darren Cross) again is spot on besides not having arm printing. Its problem lies with the dark silver colour chosen, in the movie its black. This time LEGO has decided to reuse typical bad guy head which has also been used in many other sets, it suits him so I cannot complain. His mechanical harness is my biggest problem, it’s great for kids with the ability to move them and to shoot the studs, for collectors and perfectionist like me I would have recommended that they should have used ‘Leg W Ø3.2 Shaft 1/2 M’ in Black with yellow printing on it. I’m currently trying to figure out the design of my own. The harness itself is really bulky and it’s annoying that they used a tan piece which does not fit will with the contemporary design of the figure. Finally the most controversial figure: Hank Pym. This Minifigure is the most basic of the three with minimal printing since he was the original Ant-Man before hiring Scott Lang. He uses the Gandalf’s head which was also reused in the new Jurassic World sets. Hank Pym also comes with an extra black head piece to presumably cover his entire face since the helmet didn’t? I believe he might have flashbacks in the movie of him as Ant-Man. This could also be a figure that never shows up in the movie as it could have just been a scraped idea during early production. I don’t believe an old Hank Pym could shrink anymore which is why he retired; we have to wait until we see the movie in about a month! The complete set took about 30-45 minutes to assemble. This set contains 2 numbered bags (1-2) you also get the pair of wings loose in the box. Thankfully mine were not creased. This set has one instruction manual, a comic adventure which features all three sets from the Summer 2015 Marvel wave. The comic for Ant-Man is nothing special other than showing the same thing as the box where Yellow Jacket is tossing around screws and LEGO bricks. Most people normally dread stickers but I’m so thankful for LEGO making the graphics as stickers since The ‘LEGO’ logo can be used on other colours of ‘Flat Tile 2X2, Round’ pieces since they are clear backed. Someone did mention they are not but that may be for certain countries. I defiantly need to Bricklink a couple of the sticker sheets for my upcoming MOC’s! Bag 1 features all the smaller builds and accessories including the white base with the ‘giant’ LEGO bricks representing a ‘Bright Red, Brick 1x1 and a ‘Bright Yellow, Plate 1x2’ The set also comes with the regular ‘Bright Red, Brick 1x1 and a ‘Bright Yellow, Plate 1x2’ to scale back when the figures are at their normal sizes. When pictures first surfaced of the set these quickly caught my attention. The LEGO bricks really set a scale for the Minifigures in context but you can also use them as regular Minifigures. Now it makes me wonder if the LEGO bricks will be in the movie, or if it's just a nod to the LEGO brand! The trailer does feature some simple blocks and other toys but I guess this made the most sense for a LEGO product to have ‘giant’ LEGO bricks. The screws are a very nice small build; it makes you want to build some large tools to go with them. The bag also contains two small ‘Earth Blue’ ants which are really cool. As I mentioned before, a super jumper is included. I would really discourage you using them since they chip the back of the legs. I really hope LEGO fixes this for those kids; otherwise they will have broken Minifigures within a few months of play. It also contains Ant-Man (Scott Lang) and Yellow Jacket (Darren Cross) Bag 2 features the Hank Pym Minifigure and main ‘flying ant’ build which I over looked. The model starts with building the main framework for the legs and wing attachments. The legs have very limited movement due to the large leg pieces uses. The second part is the abdomen which is defiantly the heaviest part of the build. I partially like the why the designer rendered the back as it’s so sleek. The head is the final part of the ant’s main body with its cool transparent yellow eyes and small mouth details at the front. The wings are attached last which are connected to the main body with a single ball joint each which allows for full articulation. One problem I did come across is that that the ball joint areas are besides the seating area for Ant-Man so the legs slightly rub against them when placing him in and it also limits you from moving the figure forward or backwards. It’s an easy adjustment though, you can use a ‘Cross Axle 7M’ and place a ‘1/2 Bush’ at either side before you place the ‘Ball Cup 3M Ø10.2.’ The wing pieces themselves are really cool and realistic since they have the small textures. I also dislike how the Technic beams are exposed on the wing joints; you could easily fix that by replacing the two ‘Crossaxle 3M With Knob’ with two ‘Cross Axle 3M if you are going to keep the wings tightly attached. I guess with the why LEGO have designed it gives you an option on how tight you want the wings attached. I really like that they didn’t be really lazy and included grey or black pieces for the bottom, instead the when realistic and added the ‘New Dark Red’ pieces across bottom of the entire build of the flying ant. You can also see some small amount of pink pieces which are not just there for fun, do believe they are added as realistic details. The actual build was pretty decent for its price. The model is very sturdy and nothing has fallen apart after swooshing it around for a couple of hours. Final Analysis/ Conclusion I absolutely adore this flying ant, is size is fairly small for the price of the set. Since this is a singular set from a specific movie the production value of the pair of wings and the two new helmets greatly affected how much the designer could put into the set. I’m not complaining about the size of the ant, it’s a perfect size and I wouldn’t change the size or the model, even those minor quibbles because I won’t be playing with it. I just feel it’s slightly small for the price. The addition of the ‘giant’ LEGO bricks and catapult feature, small ants, screws all set the scene and give a full sample of what you can expect from the movie. For £19.99 you cannot go wrong; it’s a great impulse buy from a movie and you don’t need to get tons of sets to get all the characters. The Minifigures, model’s and playability is all there. This is defiantly one of the best set around this price that LEGO has released in a few years. Good job designer. It appeals to me more than the current larger models on the market for sure. I got it for the Minifigures; boy was is a surprise and a successful set overall! Design: 9/10 – The design of all the elements in this set are amazing and the way they have been rendered and executed in the movie context is just outstanding! There are a few small clever details, references and jokes in this set. Build: 9/10 – The build was quite refreshing from the normal cars and boats in the Super Heroes theme. Minifigs: 9/10 – Ant-Man, Yellow Jacket and Hank Pym are all exclusive and will mostly likely never be rereleased in future sets in these variants, as Marvel is guaranteed to update and alter the designs for future movies. Playability: 9/10 – A great playset, including a ‘flying’ ant and a catapult; what else can you get for £19.99! The ant model is mostly adjustable besides the limited movement on the legs. Parts: 9/10 – This set mostly consists ‘New Dark Red’ and ‘Earth Blue elements ‘as well as a hint of dark pink. It does include one or two odd exclusive recolours and don’t forget the exclusive helmets. Price: 9/10 – The overall models feel slightly small but the price is somewhat higher due to possible costs for new helmet moulds and the wings, the fact the price is fairly low it’s hard not avoid. Overall: 9/10 – Defiantly everything a young kid would want, some small nit-picks may frustrate AFOL’s and fans of the movies/ comics.

Last year the Volvo review was published at the beginning of June, so you all needed to wait a little bit longer for this one. Rumors started early December of a licensed Mercedes set. What could it be, a truck, a car? Christmas Eve revealed the LEGO Technic 42043 Mercedes-Benz Arocs 3245. The eager anticipation of news about a new model always has its special moments. This time Paul (Boratko) had seen a first glance of the model. This resulted in one or two questions being asked. What's the color scheme? Does it have pneumatics? Does it have new pneumatic parts? Does it have double wheels on the rear axles? Does it have front suspension? Does it have this, does it have that? Was I excited at the moment? Hmmm not really. To be honest; I figured this would be the Unimog all over again. It's a public secret that I am not the biggest fan of the Unimog. A pneumatic crane that doesn't work too well, flaws in the steering mechanism and the model is leaning to one side, because of the battery box. Don't get me wrong; it is a decent model, and it definitely looks great, but it just doesn't cut it for me. So my initial thought was ""will this be better than the Unimog?"". We will find out at the end of this review The model is designed by Markus Kossman, who is lead designer at TLG and is known for some other flagship sets (among other models): 8421 - Mobile Crane (2005) 8275 Motorized Bulldozer (2007) 8110 - Mercedes-Benz-Unimog-U-400 (2011) 42009 - Crane Mk II (2013) It's safe to say that Markus has some experience when it comes to designing trucks. At the beginning of each stage, I state how long it took me to finish it. Mind you, that when I'm building for a review, I lose a lot of time shooting pictures. So your building time will probably be 70% to 80% of my time. Note: Pictures, taken with a Canon 70D with 50mm Canon prime lens, can be clicked for hi-res versions. SET INFORMATION Number: 42043 Title: Mercedes-Benz Arocs 3245 Theme: Technic Released: 2015 Part Count: 2793 Box Weight: 4455 gr Box Dimensions: 57,8 cm x 47,8 cm x 12,2 cm Model Dimensions: 54 cm x 23cm/51cm x 15cm (wo crane/w crane) Set Price (MSRP): Approximately € 200 Price per Part: Approximately € 0,072 per part Links: Brickset THE BOX The box is the same size as last year's 42030 - Volvo L350F (review). It's huge and it's heavy. Weighing in at almost 4,5kg, this actually does feel like the biggest Technic set ever. Unfortunately my box was severly damaged upon delivery. Even the outer box was damaged, and looked like someone had opened it. Luckily, the actual box was only damaged, instead of opened, so all the parts where still there. FRONT SIDE The front of the box shows the model (nothing new here), the Power Functions logo AND the new Pneumatics V2 logo. Hopefully we will see the last logo more often in future sets. Under the Pneumatic logo, all new pneumatic parts are shown. Three of the five parts are simply redesigned parts, but the two 11L cylinders (1x1 and 2x2) are brand new. INSIDE The inside of the box shows most of the features and functionality, combined with some fun facts about the real Arocs. The model will measure 54 cm upon completion. SIDES One of the sides shows the model and the two logos, while one of the other sides shows all the Pneumatic V2 and Power Functions parts. CONTENT OF THE BOX Being the biggest Technic set to date, means lots of parts. 2793 to be precise. 2 bags with 6 wheels 1 bag with instructions and stickers 1 bag with pneumatic parts 1 bag with L motor 1 battery box unbagged 4 bags #1 2 bags #2 5 bags #3 2 bags #4 6 bags #5 2 bags #6 SQUARE BOUND BOOK Like the 42039 - 24 Hours Race Car (some of them) this set has a square bound book sealed in a bag together with the sticker sheet. I really do like a single bound book, but when TLG divides the build into 6 stages, providing 6 booklets also makes sense. This would make building with your children a great deal easier. The instructions for the A-model count 105 steps, covering a whopping 471 pages! The sticker sheet with stickers for the A-model and two stickers (#25) for the B-model, apparently a Mercedes-Benz Actros 1845. For the first time (to my recollection) the 62.4mm D. x 20mm Tires are packed in bags. Normally they are scattered between the sealed bags. The new Pneumatic (V2) parts have been neatly packed together in a single bag. The hoses are cut to length, which makes assembly more straightforward. There's no need to measure and cut the hoses yourself. The L-motor comes in a bag, while the battery box doesn't. Normally the battery comes in a bag too. Since it has a slightly different color than the previous version, maybe the manufacturer or manufacturing process has changed. NUMBERED BAGS A total of 21 numbered bag, divided over 6 build stages. You can click on the bag to show a hi-res version of the picture. HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This chapter describes the interesting and/or new parts in this set. BATTERY BOX The color of the new battery box is slightly different than the old one. The dark bluish grey is much darker and the light bluish grey seems to be slightly different too. VERY SMALL SMOOTH PANELS IN WHITE For the first time a set comes with very small white panels (#21) and very small white panels (#22). These two panels complete the range of white panels available. WHITE PANELS Four other types or white panels are used in the cabin. NEW 60T TURNTABLE That kinda looks like a new turntable under the crane. Allanp was absolutely right about the introduction of a new 60 teeth turntable, resembling its smaller brother (bottom and top). As you can see in the comparison shot below, it's not much bigger than the old version. The design is much better, resulting in a smoother operation. The potential downside is that the new turntable doesn't have teeth in the inside, which can be limiting. That being said; I still think that this design is better than the old one, so thanks to TLG for bringing us this new turntable! Hopefully TLG will some day release an XL version with this design. TIRES Nothing special about these tires, besides coming in a sealed bag. So, why am I showing these tires anyway? It has nothing to do with the tires itself, but with the quantity. For the first time an official LEGO set contains more than 10 of these tires. The 42009 - Mobile Crane Mk II counts 10 of them and the same goes for the 8285 - Tow Truck from 2006. The latter also had double wheels on both rear axles, but it only had two front wheels. CRANE AND OUTRIGGER LIFTARM BRACKET AND GEARRACK I'm not sure what the part names will be, but crane arm outside and crane arm center are used for similar parts in the City theme. I will stick to Liftarm Bracket and Gearrack. These two new parts are perfect for outriggers and crane sections, but I am eager to see what MOC-ers come up with. I do see an application for Mindstorms Robots or TC7 Contest entries. The red section, containing the gear rack, is 15L. The gear rack itself is 14L. CLAMSHELL BUCKET Two clamshell buckets are introduced in this set. After the Grabber Arm Claw, this is welcome addition for crane enthusiasts. PNEUMATIC V2 Save the best for last, the new Pneumatic parts! Some people like pneumatics, some people don't. Nonetheless, it's great that TLG hasn't abandoned Pneumatics in favor of Lineair Actuators. They have redesigned some of the existing parts and even designed brand new ones. Some people on this forum will be so thrilled with these new parts. The outlets of every element have been redesigned in a way that the hose will be easier to attach. This means the existing elements do have new moulds too. SMALL PNEUMATIC CYLINDER The Small Pneumatic Cylinder isn't a new part, but it has been redesigned with new outlets. On the right you can see a comparison between the old (right) and new (left) cylinder SMALL PNEUMATIC PUMP 6L Like the small cylinder, the Small Pneumatic Pump 6L has also been redesigned. And TLG has used blue again, instead of the Unimog pump, where they used grey. I do like the blue version better, although you will probably not clearly see the pump in the finished model. The right pictures shows the three different versions of the pump. NEW 2x2 11L PNEUMATIC CYLINDER The new 2x2 11L Cylinder is 4 studs longer than the old Pneumatic Cylinder. I wonder if TLG will release a new version for the 7L cylinder as well. The picture on the right shows the 7L (right) and new 11L cylinder (left). NEW 1x1 11L PNEUMATIC CYLINDER When you do need length, but not a lot of power this new 1x1 11L will perfectly fit your needs. PNEUMATIC SWITCH The new version of the switch is simply a redesign of the old Pneumatic Switch with modified outlets. The pictures on right shows the comparison. PART LIST The part list, spreading over 3 pages, counting 2793 parts. THE BUILD The build consists of 6 stages: Front-end of the chassis Outriggers and gearbox Rear-end of the chassis Crane Cabin Tipping bed STAGE 1: FRONT-END CHASSIS Bags: 4 Duration: 120 minutes You start by building the front section of the chassis, with a small part of the cabin. No new parts are introduced in this stage, except for some newish parts from 1H 2015 and 2014, like Pin and Pin Hole and 3L Axle Pin with 1L Axle. The Arocs has a 6 cylinders inline fake engine. Of course the piston will move when you drive the vehicle. Here's a picture of the actual engine, used in the new Arocs. New 6-cylinder in-line engines with a particularly robust design and a longer life. An 88003 - PF L Motor is placed behing the fake engine, facing backwards. This motor is connected to a gearbox, which we will build in the next stage. This single motor will power all the motorized functions. Below you see the first front axle, with suspension. The 9L Technic Link is used to steer the front wheels. The front suspension uses the yellow Hard Spring Shock Absorbers, resulting in pretty stiff suspension. When the assembly is connected to the chassis, the 9L Technic Link is connected to a pivot point. Rotating the pivot point will move the link back and forth causing the front wheels to steer. The second axle is connected to the chassis. This axle uses a 6L Technic Link for steering. Using different links results in different steering angles for both axles. I did notice a strange anomaly; the front axle does have 1L Round Pin Connectors, while the second axle doesn't. The leftover parts only show one extra?! The video below shows how the steering mechanism works. Make sure the 12 Teeth Bevel Gear on the right is placed properly. I placed the gear in the same position as the one on the left, resulting in one of the lights making the model steer to the left side when turned right, and vice versa. The two pictures below show the model after stage 1. The build is okay so far. The most interesting thing about this stage is obviously the steering mechanism, attached to the pendular suspension. The mechanism is unlike steering mechanisms found in other models, so this required some out of the box thinking. STAGE 2: OUTRIGGERS AND GEARBOX Bags: 2 Duration: 45 minutes The first step of the second stage starts with the new bracket and gear rack. The outriggers could easily have been designed without this new gear rack, but since TLG designed it for the crane (probably); why not use it here. The stabilizers on the outriggers are operated manually. It would have been great to have motorized pads too, but it's not a big deal. The two outriggers are linked together in opposite directions. The new parts provide a compact solution, but there are no fixed mounting points for the driving gears. The gearbox consists of two layers with gears. The lower part of the gear box contains the Pneumatic Pump, much like the one found in the Unimog. Two black 12T Bevel Gears are driving the gear racks. The upper layer of the gear box contains the white Clutch Gear. This gear prevents the motor from stalling and overheating when the end of a function has been reached. At the end of stage 2 the gearbox and outriggers are connected to the front-end of the chassis. The truck is slowly taking shape. At this stage I was still not 100% convinced what I would think of the complete model. STAGE 3: CHASSIS REAR-END Bags: 5 Duration: 135 minutes With 135 minutes, the second longest stage in the build. In this stage you will build the rear-end of the chassis, with suspension and drive train. Four Flexible Rubber Axles are used in the base of the chassis. I am not entirely sure why TLG used these parts, since you will lock the assembly using liftarms. Possibly, it's a construction used in the real Mercedes, or these parts will be used in the B-model. I would love to hear your thoughts. The tilting mechanism for the bed uses a Linear Actuator, instead of Pneumatics. I have made a mistake by placing two of the Pin Connectors in a wrong angle. Won't be the last error with these connectors. The Rear suspension on the real Mercedes is actually a leaf spring suspension. TLG is mimicking this suspension type, by using the relatively new Steering Arms found in the 42021 - Snow Mobile and 75060 - Slave 1. Picture of the real rear suspension. The steel suspension on the Arocs impresses in every situation with its robust, solid construction, high performance and loadability. Two differentials are linked together using a small turntable. Although being linked together, the two axles still have the ability to move independently. The model will have two live axles, linked together by a drive train through the small turntable. Live axle vs Dead axle A live axle is a type of beam axle in which the shaft (or shafts, since live axles, while connected to move as a single unit, are seldom one piece) also transmits power to the wheels; a beam axle that does not also transmit power is sometimes called a dead axle. While typically used in vehicles with Hotchkiss drive, this suspension system can also be used with other types of power transmission. Or, to quote Allanp, who was right again: The rear axles are a single unit (suspended by 4 springs) that pivots longitudinally to allow the two axles to twist independently from each other by means of a 28t turntable piece allowing full suspension and both rear axles to be connected to the engine whilst all fitting between the dual rear wheels. Simples! Here's a video showing the rear suspension and drive train. WARNING We've all been there, a model with two differentials and one of them is turning the wrong way. TLG has published an explicit warning in the building instructions. Pay attention to the position of the differentials! After building the rear-end of the chassis, you will be merging it to the front-end of the chassis. This was the point where I needed to move my camera backwards a lot. The model is growing big. Double rear wheels on both axles, suspension and two live axles is quit a feat, especially regarding the limited available space. For me this stage was the turning point in the build. From now on you actually see the impressiveness of the model. STAGE 4: CRANE Bags: 2 Duration: 120 minutes Only two bags are provided for this stage, but it still took me quite some time. Connecting the pneumatic hoses does take more time than simply adding connectors. This stage did offer a variety of new parts, like the Pneumatic V2, new Turntable and the two Clamhell Buckets. Pre-cut hoses are quite convenient. The instructions clearly show which length you will be needing. There's little difference between 216mm and 240mm so watch out. The new 60 Teeth Turntable is mounted on the base of the crane. It turns a lot smoother than the old version. TLG really nailed this one! Normally I build in my LEGO room, but this time I was building in the living room. I was building, combined with reading topics on Eurobricks. At that moment I was reading Drakmin's response in the Technic Photography topic. He stated that he'd like to see making of pictures, combined with the end result. This made me take the next picture, where you can see my working place. And as you can see, sometimes a LEGO model needs a little spicing up The bottom view of the crane shows lots of tubing, which will add difficulty when you connect the crane to the chassis. The tubing is touching one of the gears, so you need to push the hoses aside. There's quite some stress on the hoses, so it can be difficult to get everything into place. A lot of Pneumatic Hose Connectors are used to guide the various tubes alongside the jib and booms. Instead of using a single longer hose, the sections are linked together using these connectors. The picture below shows the complete crane assembly. Normally I am not the biggest fan of pneumatics or building the crane on a truck, but I had a lot of fun building this one. Not sure why, but the size of the crane is very impressive and the techniques/parts used are pretty cool. STAGE 5: CAB Bags: 6 Duration: 150 minutes Stage 5 is the longest stage in the build. And it's probably the most rewarding, since you will see the truck come to life. You start by building the front bumper. The rear view shows how the slanting grill is achieved. The name Kossmann is clearly visible on the plate, making no mistake that Markus Kossmann designed this model. The front bumper is connected to the chassis by simply using connectors. The axles with the gears are sliding into the 7L liftarm, keeping them in place. At this point the chassis with crane is mostly done. You only need to add the rear bumper, before you can start building the cabin. The cabin grill is comprised of lots of Perpendicular Double Split Axle and Pin Connectors. I really like the design of the seats, because of its simplicity. The printed Mercedes logo adds a lot of value to the cabin. Here you can see another mistake I made with the pin connector. No way the steering wheel will fit like this. The Mercedes introduces two new white panels. They are used as ""cab side edge turning vanes"", which improve aerodynamics. There was some discussion about the looks of the cabin, but seeing it in real life, I can only draw a single conclusion; this cabins is one of the most beautiful cabins LEGO has ever designed/released. The front view is stunning! Here you can clearly see that I accidentally moved the head rests and didn't return them to the proper position. You will see this discrepancy returning in multiple photo's. I found a mistake in the manual, which can be somewhat confusing. I didn't look at the image when connecting the cab to the chassis, but when I did take a look when I was shooting pictures, I noticed this small flaw. The circle with the arrow, doesn't match the outlined image on the right. The circle with the arrow needs to be placed lower than its current position. Here you can see the tilting mechanism on the actual model. Front view of the cabin and grill. It does make you wonder whether this could have been the right moment to introduce a Dark Bluish Grey 11x3 Curved Panel. The front is instantly recognizable as a Mercedes. Obviously the Mercedes emblem helps a lot, but without the star it would have been clear too. At first I wasn't too happy with the white and dark bluish grey color scheme, but seeing it in real life makes a world of difference. Here's a picture of the actual cabin. The main difference is that the LEGO version only has three bars, instead of 4. I can live with this. The bottom front section of the cabin seems to be some sort of metal, so maybe Markus was right by using the light bluish grey panel. The radiator grille designed in a bucket tooth look lends the Arocs a striking, unmistakeable face and underlines its power and robustness. The leftover parts, I forgot to add to the previous shot. STEP 6: TIPPING BED Bags: 2 Duration: 30 minutes This is by far the easiest stage of the build, consisting of mainly grey panels and liftarms. The intersection shows the simple construction of the tilting bed. The finished bed looks....well uhhmm grey. A cool thing about the tipping bed is the lock at the end. This locks the tailgate of the bed to prevent cargo falling out. FINISHED MODEL After 10 hours of building the model is finally finished! I reckon most of you will do this in 8 hours (or less), if you don't rush the build. Markus delivered a great looking model, which is even more impressive in real life, than in pictures. As you can see in the picture below, there is quite some strain on the base of the crane assembly, where the pneumatic switches are mounted. Some of the hoses at the base can probably be cut a little shorter, to save space. BOTTOM VIEW The bottom view shows the entire chassis, with suspension, steering and drive train. Some of you said the wheels are too small and there's too much space between the wheels and the arches. Looking at pictures of the real Arcos, the second front arch, could have been placed a stud lower. Those minor details set aside, the finished model resembles the Arocs a lot! Even the rear view gives you the feeling you are looking at a real truck. With extended outriggers and stabilizers and operating the crane. I forgot to put the wheel chocks between the rear wheels for extra safety. My reviews always contain pictures taken in a photo studio. Unfortunately, this doesn't do this model real justice. That's why I left my comfort zone and went out to shoot some pictures at a local construction site. A friend of mine is the manager of the site and he happens to be building his own new house over there as well. There's no better excuse to take the Mercedes for a drive in his natural habitat. And while we are at it, why not let the Volvo tag along for the ride. FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS This set has quite a few features and functions. Controlling them is done by a combination of using the L-motor as a pump for the Pneumatic functions or by switching it to control three other functions. Switching is done by moving the levers on either side of the model. Reversing the function is done by the switch on the battery box. In the beginning this can be quite confusing. Since you are used to using a lever to switch between back and forth, I ended up switching between functions, instead of reversing the current function. MOTORIZED FUNCTIONS The Mercedes uses a single L-motor to motorize 4 functions: Rotating the crane Extending/retracting the outriggers Tilting the bed Compressor pump PNEUMATIC FUNCTIONS When the motor is driving the compressor, again 4 functions can be operated (as shown in the two images above): Opening and closing the bucket(s) Lowering/raising lower boom section Lowering/raising upper boom section Extending/retracting the jib MANUAL FUNCTIONS There are also quite some manual functions on this model: HoG Steering Tilting cabin Working fake enginge Wheel chocks Opening doors Stabilizers Tailgate tilting bed lock FEATURES Below is a list of the most important features: Double wheels on both rear axles Leaf sprung suspension on rear axles Two live rear axles Independant pendular suspension on front wheels OPERATING THE FUNCTIONS The long list of functions and features is great, but the most important question is ""do they work properly?"". Operaring the functions takes a little getting used to. Maybe it's just me, but I tend to get confused on whether to move the switch on the battery box or the lever on the side. For example; when you extend the outriggers and you want to retract them, you need to switch the battery box, instead of the lever, resulting in rotating the crane. Actually, I know that I am not the only one, since the guy demonstrating the model, didn't quite get it right too. Of course, after making the same mistake several times, you get used to it It helps a lot when you manage to use the right switches and levers. All the motorized functions work perfectly. The pneumatic functions do work a lot better than the crane on the Unimog, with a side note that movement can be a bit jerky sometimes. This is caused by gravity or strain on the pneumatic hoses. Besided the incidental jerky movement, you can actually fully operate the crane, which is something you'd expect from a flagship like this. Before we go any further, let's take a look at a video I shot demonstrating the functions: The video seems to be slightly out of focus. Sorry for that. As you can see in the video, I still need to find my way around the functions. The jerky and sometimes slow movement of the pneumatic functions is also visible. However, I still think the crane is as good as you will get using LEGO and Pneumatics. Lifting the entire crane simply requires a lot of power. All in all I am very pleased with the playability of the model. Here's an extra image, showing the truck with the cabin and bed tilted. B-MODEL Since the building instructions are not available yet, I couldn't build the B-model. This appears to be a Mercedes-Benz Actros 1845, as you can see on the back of the box. The cabin has more or less the same design, but the chassis is different. SUMMARY Here we are, at the end of this review. The main question I posed at the beginning of this review ""Is this set better than the Unimog?"" can be answered with a loud ""Yes!"". Your milage may vary, but the pneumatic crane is more advanced and it is working better than the one on the Unimog. There's no problem with the model leaning to one side and steering, although not perfect on this model either, works better than the Unimog. Which brings us to the obvious next question. Is this set also better than the 8258 - Crane Truck? The 8258 is absolutely a fantastic set (probably the most highly acclaimed truck to date), but to be honest; I think the Mercedes just kicked it from the throne. Without stickers, the 8258 doesn't look nearly as good as the Mercedes. Add the ongoing list of functions to the mix and the only possible conclusion is; the Mercedes is the best LEGO Technic Truck TLG has ever released. Aren't there any negative remarks? Of course there are, but they are minor. Because the steering mechanism uses more gears than usual, there's more torsional strain on the axles. Pneumatic control of the crane can be a bit jerky or slow. There are a lot of hoses between the switches and underneath the base of the crane, which requires applying some force when you attach it to the chassis. You also need to be mindful that the gear on the chassis doesn't touch one of the hoses. Here's a complete list with Pros and Cons: PROS The model looks awesome Biggest Technic set to date New Pneumatic (V2) parts 4 Motorized functions 4 Pneumatic functions The crane actually works Double wheels on rear axles Leaf sprung rear suspension Pendular front suspension CONS Steering causes torsional strain on axles Pneumatic controls can be a bit jerky (or slow) Lots of hoses underneath the base of the crane The last question I need to ask myself, is this set better than the Volvo L350F or the 8043 - Motorized Excavator? I'm not sure about that, but I will conclude this review by saying that the Mercedes did land a spot in my Top-3. SCORE How do I grade this set? 9 DESIGN Resembles the real deal a lot. 9 BUILDING EXPERIENCE The model grew on me during the build. 9 FEATURES Packs a ton of features. 9 PLAYABILITY The model offers lots of playability 9 PARTS Pneumatics V2 and lots of other interesting parts. 9 VALUE FOR MONEY You get a lot of Mercedes for your money. 9 BEST TRUCK TO DATE Thanks for reading and feel free to ask questions! More pictures can be found on my Flickr page. FINAL WORDS For those of you who are interested, I have tracked the time working on this review. I ended up putting around 35 hours in it, divided over: 2 hours of unboxing and taking pictures of contents 10 hours of building 3 hours of photo processing 18 hours writing the review 2 hours on construction site"

Outstanding photos, and while I appreciate the studio shots for their detail, I think the truck looks better in the outdoors shots. The steering system looks really clever, especially because it's so simple yet ( seems) very reliable. My attempts at building link-steering systems for a truck did not fare so well. Overall, I'm very, very pleased with this set and will be a day 1 buy for me. Just beautiful Also Jim, the purpose of those flexible rubber connectors is to allow the upper pivot points of the 4 steering arms to slightly move in towards each other when the suspension is compressed. I don't know if that made sense, I'm not very good at explaining. The rear suspension would not work with completely rigid pivots."

Quick question: How sturdy is it? Obviously, being from TLG, the chassis is ridiculously sturdy, but are there any parts, like the bumpers or the cabin that feel a bit loose?

And then have to end that experience with the dullest part of the build. Chances are that truck bed could have been done before the cab was build. (I'll probably start my build with that truck bed)

Fact is, it took me a second reading just to let the model's greatness sink in. Now for a few things... I so do want to use the 1/11 cylinder in a 4-wide heavy-equipment model (16-axle mobile crane) and the 2x2/11L in a 6-wide model (a mix of this one and this one, but with more axles), but I worry about the integration of the cylinders, the valves, and the pump, especially in 4-wide. Do these cylinders work on their own? And will they break when they do so? Those new turntables. They'll be some most-wanted parts, but if they show up in more sets... well, why not? Pure intimidation on the last construction-site shot. Would be mistaken for the real thing. It rocks. Expensive, yes (I need more scratch cards!), but seriously, Jim, make this a family heirloom, one that can be passed to future generations."

Your quality is some of the best out there and I love reading these reviews. Regarding the model, I think TLG really outdid themselves with this one. Honestly in some ways this model could pass for a MOC as its attention to detail is very good, and it gives every previous legendary set a run for its money. I was planning to get the new Ferrari creator set, but I think this will have to replace it. America will probably get it late"

I picked this one up at the Downtown Disney LEGO store back in July. Having grown up on the wheat fields of central Kansas, I am quite familiar with Combines and have ridden on one many times. Admittedly, I was hoping for the motorized bulldozer so this guy had to take its place. The Box: Fairly large box with the usual trimmings. The back of the box mostly shows the alternate model which is a dragster. The box design is back to the two seals in the front and the perforated top that flips up (that you may recall I had so much trouble with in the past.) Here is what you get inside: Once you get everything dumped out, you have 15 bags and four tires in addition to the four manuals. They do a pretty nice job of sorting everything out for you: The Manuals: Pretty straightforward manuals here and up to the usual LEGO standard and are 64,63,53 and 23 pages in length. The usual features are included: - Piece call outs for each step - Parts inventory at the end of the primary model build - Page numbers Color separation in these manuals were fine for the most part although I did mistake a dark gray for black a couple of times. Random manual photos: Parts list: The Pieces: Well, this IS a Technic set after all so you get a TON of Technic parts. There are some old-school parts. It was kind of a flashback to my earlier days of the expert builder sets (early Technic) back in the 1980s. For those of you youngsters, that was BEFORE cable TV (at least in Kansas)! The universal joint: And the gear rack: There are LOTS of studless beams, pins, lift arms, axles, connectors and a few panel fairings. Note for those of you who like studs in your LEGO sets, they are few and far between here. Probably less than 1% of the parts in this set even have studs. As far as color goes, mostly light and dark gray, lime green and black are your primary colors here. The Build: The build was pretty ordinary. Again, this is a Technic fan?s set. As you can see from the photos below, EVERYTHING is held together with pins (regular and long). You know you are building a Technic set when you thumbs are aching when it is done. There were no gotchas to speak of and the build was well paced. Here is what is left over: So far, I have only built the primary model. The drag racer does not appeal to me. The Design: I guess as far as combines go, it does capture the look and feel of one. There are several moving parts. For one, the boom extends: In: Out: It is kind of a neat mechanism done by turning a red knob hidden under a panel that flips up: Also, the steering is done via hand-of-God which turns the rear (smaller) tires. You can see the gear that is used for steering on the top of the combine in the photo below: There is another gear that is hidden under a panel that lifts up on the top of the combine just to the rear of the cabin. Turning this gear will raise and lower the head (or cutter) of the combine. Just like on a real combine, forward motion will cause the revolving sickles to rotate. This action is what cuts and separates the grain from the stalk. On a real combine, you can attach various heads for different types of grain. Here is a photo of the head. The red bars are the revolving sickles. Overall Thoughts: It?s just OK. I know I did post some time ago that I wish we would get more varied Technic sets. A combine is not really what I hand in mind so I guess you need to be careful what you wish for. However, as I said it does a good job of accurately portraying the workings of a real combine. At the end of the day, I guess it just doesn?t flip my switch? I?d be surprised if this set does well. I?m not saying it is a poor set, I just doubt many people get real excited about building a combine. I?d rate it 3rd out of the three new Technic sets just released. I wish all these newly designed Technic sets would have space and functionality to add in motors, especially the IR ones. This one does not. Final Rating: 64% Build 8/10 (It was a nice trip back to the days of all Technic parts.) Functionality 6/10 (It does a nice job of being a combine. If you are not familiar with the workings of a combine, you won?t be too impressed.) Design 8/10 (Above average.) Parts 6/10 (Lots and lots of small Technic parts. Nothing special.) Price 4/10 (Seems way too expensive for what it is.)"

I'm not impressed with this direction in the line. I don't follow the colour scheme either and have almost no use for studless parts and hundreds of pins. Guess now I know what the inside of the UCS Falcon will look like. Maybe I'll need some of these parts to attempt to restructure it enough to build some interior.

I am not sure wether it appeals to me, it looks good, like a real combined harvester and it has many many parts (over a thousand). The colorscheme looks a bit strange, but I think it fits the model, after all harvesters come in weird colors in real life as well.

The set has 1063 pieces and retails for about 100 USD which seems a bit high. When the first images were leaked, the reactions were very mixed. Some people liked it others didn’t and the main complaint was that the set’s front end looks quite ugly. Honestly I wasn’t a fan of the whole second half of 2014 line up, but I decided to buy this set for the parts and do a review of it as I quite enjoy making reviews. Anyway lets get on to the actual review. The Box I apologize for the glare on the box, I'm not sure how to avoid that. The box is weirdly shaped as it is long and short in height. It feels full and has a pleasant weight to it which makes you think that the price was worth it. Here's what I mean about the shape. Compared to a model with similar parts, the box is not really square. Here's the back of the box. It displays the model's various functions, the possibility to motorize it, and the B model. The B model honestly looks terrible to me as it looks like a mess. Here's the contents of the box. There are 11 bags and once opened, the parts barely fit on my temporary, tiny table that I was using to build. The box also contains two instruction manuals( and no instructions for the B model as always) and an unsecured sticker sheet. Since the sheet wasn't secured, mine arrived with a large bend in it. This picture is after 5-10 minutes of trying to flatten it. The Build The build starts with the rear axle and the mini linear acuator for dumping. Not much is really going on right now. Some beams are placed diagonally to make a sort of truss which is kinda interesting. The other interesting thing is how the dump function works. Normally in Lego vehicles the linear acuator pushes the dump bed up as shown in this photo by Blakbird. Instead of using this basic pushing mechanism, the acuator in 42029 is mounted facing downward and fully opened in closed form. When you want it to dump, the acuator pulls the bed up instead of pushing. I'm not sure what benefit this gives, but it is an interesting way to make a mechanism. Anyway back to the build. The build then goes to the front of the chassis. At this stage, you get a feel for the size of the model, and to me it seemed a bit small at first. After that the build takes an odd step. In a model it makes more sense to build a complete chassis and then build the bodywork, but in this model the build ignores that the chassis is not finished, and moves on to the cab section. The cab looks alright, but the interior looks very half baked. The seats are too small for this model and they're blue... again . I'm really getting tired of seeing blue seats in models. It doesn't look realistic, and is it really that hard to make different colored seats? This trend has been used sparingly for many years, but then in 2009 it started to get used for most models. It's been 6 years of that now and I think its time for change. Anyway on to another overused Technic mechanic- the gearbox. The 42029 follows the time honored tradition of a function splitting gearbox. This iteration of it is quite simple with only two functions- a winch(again ), and a dump bed. The functions are controlled by the black bevel gear on the bottom, or from the 8 tooth gear on the right as that's where the M motor can be placed. The cab is attached and the model starts to resemble its final form. Next the engine is added. This was also a source of controversy as it was a V6. Most pickup trucks use a V8 so this was a bit odd. It's also not that hard to squeeze in 2 extra cylinders as evidenced by Sariel's motorization of it, so this seems to be laziness on TLG's part Another interesting thing I found was that the instructions displayed the old mold for engine blocks while my set included the new blocks. The odd thing is that my 42009 also has the newer style blocks and its from 2013, so I would think the 42029 instructions would include these new blocks as the set came out a full year after 42009. Next you have to build the front axle. I'm not a huge fan of these new hubs as there has to be so much space between the suspension arms. Also an interesting technique is used to limit the suspension. The white pieces, which are normally used in studded sets, block the arms from sagging under weight. Front axle mounted. At this point the steering also works and you could have a rolling chassis if you wanted to. And now the cliche winch piece is built. On a side note, I have 2 shelves of Legos. One shelf contains supercars and the rest is ordinary sets. Every single set I have built on that shelf has a winch or thread of some kind. They're all done differently, of course, but i just find winches boring. As a function they're quite boring unless its absolutely necessary such as the 42009 or 8258. Now here's another source of disappointment- the ugly front end. When you look at modern pickup trucks( especially American ones), they all have a feeling of power. The grilles are massive and are covered in chrome and the lights are large and boxy. Just look at the new Ford F-150. The 42029 looks so weak compared to these trucks. Instead of large boxy headlights it has bug eyed lights which are made from gearbox extenders. The grille also looks terrible. Its a mashup of red and grey parts which does anything but evoke a sense of power. I think they could have made it look a little better if they had replaced the red bushes in the grille with grey. Also look at those #3 connectors in grey. There was also some controversy about this as they look very out of place, and this was the perfect opportunity to bring back the rare #3 connectors in red. They brought back the red 5x11 panels in this set, so why couldn't they do they same for these connectors? I replaced mine just to see how it would look and it looks a lot cleaner. Overall the whole front area looks quite disappointing and feels sloppy. Anyway on to the rest of the build and there's not much left of it. The dumping bed is attached and a few other details are added and bam you're done. The dumping bed is an uncommon feature for a pickup truck, but it works well, and gives it a second function thus giving TLG an excuse to use another function splitting gearbox Here are the spare parts Completed model Here's a few pics of the finished model. I think the rear is simple and pretty well done Here's a side shot. With the high suspension, it feels more like a crawler to me than a pickup truck. The suspension is one of the best things about this model. It feels neither too soft or hard and is nice and bouncy. It also has amazing travel. The model's winch also works smoothly as with every other model with a winch. The set can also be motorized with the 8293 power functions set. All you need is an M motor, LEDs, a battery box, and a clutch gear. Motorizing it is quite easy and only takes a few minutes, but one should manage their cables properly, as I didn't pay much attention to the placement and it they stopped the bed from fully closing. I didn't care much for the motorization as it just put lights on the roof and motorized 2 functions. Unlike the 42024, this set doesn't really need the motorizing as the functions work at a reasonable speed, so I decided to not keep the motorization and advise you not to waste your money on the extra parts required to do the motorizing. I decided to take the set outside in order to match its rugged looks. Nice view of the V6 and its turbochargers? Not sure what the things are on top of the engine. Everything opened I also decided to give the dumping bed a practical test with birdseed and it worked well although the bed and parts of the chassis got quite dusty One flaw with the dumping is that the tailgate has to be opened manually. It doesn't make much sense to put a dumping function yet not have an easily opening tailgate. Personally I would have liked to see the tailgate use frictionless pins and some sort of manual locking mechanism. It would feel a bit more realistic at least to me. Final Thoughts The model doesn't have the greatest looks or the most realistic functions, but it has a great assortment of parts. Personally even though this set claims to be for older ages, I feel that it would appeal to younger children more due to its high ride height and quirky looks. It is also one of the most durable models that I have built. The suspension absorbs drops and it can be rolled over multiple times with no or minimal damage. At one point it accidentally fell off a sofa and it survived with only the roof lights and one steering link breaking. With all this sturdiness, its an interesting build as there is so much reinforcement and it is fun to see how they achieve this. The model is easy to break into chunks and has a lot of possibility for modification, so that's always good. Overall Build- 8/10 It's a fairly standard build, nothing too surprising, but it is fun to see how sturdiness can be achieved. Also there are a few interesting parts Looks- 4/10 Really TLG? This looks nothing like a modern pickup truck. I get that its ""customized"" but that gives no excuse to how half baked the looks are. The front end looks sloppy and the rear is just simple Parts 10/10 Steering arms, suspension, CV joints, ton of red parts, beams in black, dark bluish grey, etc. Its a great parts selection to build your own model. Functions 7/10 Lets see, it has great suspension, steering, a V6 , yet another winch , and a function splitter which really wasn't necessary. Price 7/10 At first glance the price looks alright, and you get the .10 cents per part ratio, however, it feels like it should have been priced a bit cheaper. Just look at the 42024- over 900 parts for 70.99. Now I understand that this model uses some more expensive parts and such, but i think it should really be priced at $85. That sounds like a more fair price since you have to pay an extra 30 to buy the kit that motorizes it. Final score 36/50 The set is a big pile of 'meh'. It could have been better, but its just average, and doesn't have much realism. It provides a ton of modification possibilities(Perhaps this was TLG's intent with this set hence the ""Customized"" name) and I would love to sit for hours and modify it into something better, but it also fills the function of expensive parts pack, and that's what I will probably be using mine for. In a perfect world where I had more money, I'd love to buy 2 of these and use one as a parts pack and modify the other one, but I guess I'll just have to modify this one and then break it for its parts. For now though its staying on my shelf just beckoning me to go and try to make it even more of a customized pickup truck. Thanks for reading my review. As always constructive feedback is appreciated and please voice how you feel about this set too. Edited by Rishab N, 18 July 2015 - 02:38 AM."

I felt like learned something new from this truck, but it was in the what-to-avoid category. I had the same experience when building this set. The whole chassis is just not clean/elegant. There are no continuous beams going back to front, instead they make a step below the cabin to get some space for the gearbox, which breaks my mechanical heart. I found the whole building experience very unfulfilling. It is just so thrown together as a bunch of pieces... No flow on the inside, no flow on the outside. I had better saved myself the time building this thing (which is a first for me...)"

I felt the grille is weak so I redid mine with Humvee style grille and also redid the headlights. It has a different vibe to it, the trucks seems to have been inspired by Power Wagons from the 1950's but it lacks a proper 4x4 setup, the 6-cylinder is nice but most heavy duty American trucks (Class-3 above - correct me if I'm wrong - uses Inline setup not Vee setup, but hey Ford and Ram are now championing V-6 for their trucks, which I still find disturbing). A V-8 would really have helped this set and I feel this set is underrated because of it's awkward setup but for me it's more appealing than the 42030."

Yea i totally agree with your view. Again I can't help but think this is a set that is more for younger children even though the age says 11-16. I feel that this type of vehicle(sorry I'm going to stereotype a bit) would appeal to a boy under 10 as it has the looks. Every boy that age has probably liked monster trucks or pickup trucks at some point and this set hits that desire."

I personally think this set is pretty dang cool; it's fun to build and to play about with. I agree with you on the PF side of things; it's better to leave this thing on manual. Plus, the roof needs to come off it you do shove in the motor, which I'm not keen on. As for the B-model, the Forest Skidder is quite great as well. Doesn't use as many panels as the A, which makes it look a bit holey in places, but otherwise it's a good model. It's the most complete and fully equipped skidder to date, with bulldozer blade, claw and winch, and like the A-model is easy to build and use. Wish the set came with the instructions... So, yeah, as I said before, good review! You have a good critical technique."

I kind of liked this set, in the sense that I enjoyed building it (but I enjoy building just about anything ), and playing around with it on the dining table was fun for a while. As I'm still trying to get some more studless technic to complement my 80s and 90s collection, I thought this was quite a good part selection. I agree though that it isn't the best looking set ever. Also, the gearbox was not really needed, as motorizing this set is not particularly useful. Edited by Ludo Visser, 23 July 2015 - 07:30 AM."

Please forgive the very poor quality of the pics as they were taken on my mobile not a decent camera I was really impressed with the 2006 City Advent Calendar so had to have this years as soon as I saw it.

The right-hand side contains the numbered push open windows Parts list You don't have to open each of the little windows to get at the pieces or to look at the pictures of what to make. You can easily open an end, slide out the plastic tray and peek inside. I never pay attention to which order the mini-sets should be made so lets start with the 8 minifigs. Police Officer and Fireman Railway Steward and Air Steward 4 workers It's a shame that there isn't a Santa/St Nicholas/Father Christmas like last year, especially as I was expecting one with the character being on the box Now, on to the gifts I like the arrow and will be making more for my construction crew and *wub* *wub* the orange grit bin hmm, well, the traffic lights are ok, but whats with the radar dish? *wub* *wub* more orange!!

The build It takes so little time to build this set that I didn't get to take any pictures of the process. Every step was accompanied by an element description although I doubt most of you will need that with so few pieces to keep track on. Most of the dark green bricks have a sticker - even the slopes where the rough surface makes stickers fall off easily! There should also have been a sticker on the windshield, but I wanted to keep that piece clean for better usage later. (I'm one of those who keeps stickers on the bricks) The model You want to see this model from the front, as the back is pretty much neglected There isn't much for the pilot to grab a hold on either. He is pretty much a sitting duck up there with the screen giving him only partial cover. There is a huge wrench next to him which kind of symbolizes the crudeness of the mech. The set isn't called ""Cyclone Defender"" for nothing. The right arm might hold an ordinary light assault riffle, but the other has a spinning disc with samurai swords which you can turn with the yellow knob on the backside. Those of you who have seen Robot Wars might remember the incredible power of this melee weapon from a robot named Hypnodisc. It would have been nice had there been a pull-back motor to power the disc (I'm sure LEGO has a lot of these in stock), but the simple mechanism still works reasonably well. The riffle comes off and a pin makes it easy to hold with the hand, but the disc is fixed to the arm. It is also a problem that the swords get misaligned quickly during play. The minifig I really like this minifig because of the neat idea with an expression on each side that LEGO has made a standard for Exo Force. Posability Most mech-moc'ers show off their creations using Gundam-like poses. With two joints per leg (one being the ankles) and one for an arm I thought of some less serious poses: Crawling (Silent like a ninja!): Belly gliding: Kick off!; Upside down: Final Rating I have to disappoint you here. This is my first set in this line and I have absolutely no idea of how good it is. The last robot I bought was the awesome 6889 Spyrius Recon Robot for the same price, but it is in a completely different genre. The set had what I expected (two white wings) and is as such a no-nonsense set. I guess it would be of more use if you have some more Exo Force, which I don't. 6/10 Ups: Has great minifig, weapons and is easy to build. Downs: Crude design and a bit too expensive for what you get. (Brickshelf gallery)"

This set is priced around 7 Euros here in Germany, which is a very fair price for what you get in my oppinion. It?s a little disappointing though, that I couldn?t think of any alternate builds for this set, and there are no inspirations on the box or the EF website."

It is funny you should mention Germany. I thought the prices for LEGO were even higher there! I'm sure I paid more than MSRP last time I bought LEGO from from your country. On the other hand.

I got the set for MSRP (180kr = 24 euro) which is a fair price here in Denmark. As all other Creator sets there are instructions for several models (3 in this case). The box The box is a little larger than City sets in the same price range. The primary model is shown on the front while you see the secondary ones on the back. What you get 312 pieces in 5 polybags and two building instructions: one for the primary model and the other for the rest. The built It was impossible for me to speed build this model because of the nifty functional details from the retractable landing gear to the wings that can turn by means of the handle in the back of the model. It took me a full hour to build it because I had to ""test"" how it all works together. The finished model The landing gear isn't fully enclosed when retracted and the models are sub-minifig scale, but I still love the design of the models. The doors for the rear wheels open as you pull the wheels down and the final piece of functionality comes from the wings that can either tilt (the horizontal stabilizers) or have elevators. Wing in, wings out, wings in, wings out... Ratings As a whole I actually like this set even more than the Big Rig. The models are just as diverse but the added functionality makes the plane more fun to play with than the rig. Price: 7/10 - A good price, but not a bargain as the Big Rig Design: 9/10 - There could have been a sligtly higher level of details in the main model, but all models are really good looking and I especially like the design of the hovercraft. Functionality: 10/10 - I guess you could ask for working rudders, opening cockpit and so on, but the plane is really filled with movable parts and the turning of the wings works really well. Secondary models: 7/10 - A hovercraft! How awesome is that!? If only the last model was just as inventive instead of a standard helicopter... Modifiability: 8/10 - The bricks are in ordinary colours and there is a good variety of them giving you plenty of possibilities for MOC'ing. You can easily make the main model into something that looks more like an F-14. 9/10 Probably as good as it gets for a Creator set in this price range. It is entertaining to both build and play with, looks good and the secondary models are worth building as well! (Brickshelf gallery)"

I think it is a really cool model, but The steering wheel doen't work too well. It doesn't turn easilly all the way around and when the craft turns, it doesn't stay stable on the three wheels because the front wheel turns quite alot into the opposite side. Now to the third model! This is quite a basic helicopter with the functionality of having the rotors turning. It doesn't use that many of the bricks and doesn't even have a landing gear. I have a question to all of you. As you can see, I prefer to show one or two large pictures and have the rest as clickable thumbnails. Most people use only the relatively big (typically 640x480) pictures so that you don't have to follow links. What do you prefer?

From the Avengers to the X-Men and down to even the most obscure characters like Ant-Man, every one of their movies has been a big hit until now. The latest Marvel movie, Fant4stic, was released last month and while I have not seen it yet, I'm sure it's just as great as their other movies. I mean, it has the word ""Fantastic"" in the title after all! And being the smart business that they are, The Lego Company decided to get in on the hype early and capitalize on this movie's undoubtful success two years in advance by making a set featuring Fant4stic's main villain, Dr. Doom. Now that's what I call forward thinking! But did they do a good job with it or were they being overhasty? Let's find out! Set Number: 76005 Name: Spider-Man: Daily Bugle Showdown Theme: Marvel Super Heroes Subtheme: Ultimate Spider-Man Year of Release: 2013 Pieces: 476 Minifigs: 5 Price: $49.99 USD S@H description: Quote Swing into the Daily Bugle and stop Dr. Doom™! Dr. Doom™ and his henchman Beetle™ are attacking the Daily Bugle in their speedy jet to steal Spider-Man's™ secret identity. It's up to Spider-Man™ and Nova™ to swing in and stop them! Trigger the Daily Bugle's explosion functions to cause destruction as the jet fires missiles! Stop Dr. Doom™ from hitching the jet's anchor hook to the safe with Spider-Man's secret inside! Knock Beetle™ off the building with the swinging web attack and drop Dr. Doom™ inside with the rooftop trapdoor! Then fly Nova™ in through the broken window with the dumpster catapult function and send those villains back to where they came from. Includes Spider-Man™, Nova™, Dr. Doom™, Beetle™ and J. Jonah Jameson™ with accessories and weapons. The first thing that comes to mind after reading this description is: Wow, that's a lot of TMs! Anyway, here are some resource links for this set: Brickset Bricklink Rebrickable The Box Since this set is based on the Ultimate Spider-Man cartoon, the box has the usual USM design with the red Marvel Super Heroes background, an illustration of Spidey in the upper right corner, and the USM logo in the lower right. As usual, there is a minifig line up in the lower left, and since this was before the terrible redesign, you can see the full body of the minifigs. I really miss this type of line up. There is quite a lot going on here: Doctor Doom attacking the Daily Bugle in his jet while simultaneously reaching for J. Jonah Jameson below with his jet's claw, Spider-Man (reluctantly) swings in to save him, while Nova fights off the Beetle. It's a pretty cool scene, even though it's not very accurate to the show. In ""Beetle Mania"", the episode that this set is based on, the Beetle was indeed out to kill JJJ, but it was in order to stop him from exposing his identity, not Spider-Man's (although Spidey was next on JJJ's list). And while he is a recurring villain on the show, Doctor doom had nothing to do with this plot and didn't even appear in the episode aside from a brief cameo. It's awesome that they included him anyway, though, so I'm not gonna complain. Note that the tower is so tall that it wraps around the top of the box. There, you can also see a scale reference with the Spider-Man minifig. On the back of the box, you can see the interior of the Bugle and all of its play features which there are quite a few of since this is a playset. It's all illustrated pretty well, although Lego's choice of sound effects is still a mystery to me. I don't get why they don't go for Spider-Man's signature ""Fwip!"" instead of ""Fazzing!"" and I didn't know that a breaking window made the sound ""Btoom!"" but I digress. Contents Inside the box you will find three instruction booklets (one smaller than the others), a comic book, a fairly large sticker sheet, five numbered bags, and two loose pieces: A white string piece and a gray 16x8 plate. There aren't really any notable pieces and nobody cares about the comic bock (no offense to the artist), so lets get right to the instructions. They are pretty straight forward and easy to follow. Some of the pages have a ghostly image of Spidey, Nova, and Dr. Doom in the top right corner which is fitting since these are all minifigs that appear in this set (which is strangely not something that can be said for many other Super Heroes instructions with this type of artwork). Minifigures As with most Super Heroes sets, most people will get this set mainly for the minifigs, so without further ado, let's talk about them. Spider-Man is the same old bootless one you get in almost every USM set. Not much to say about him. Some might complain that we don't get Spidey's alter ego Peter Parker in this set, but in the USM cartoon, MJ is actually the one who works at the Daily Bugle, not Peter. Curse the creators of this cartoon for ruining our chances of getting a new Peter Parker minifig by trying to mix things up. Next we get J. Jonah Jameson. He appeared in a Spider-Man 2 set before, but this is a complete redesign. He now has a blue suit with a red tie, a unique face print, and that combed-back hair in dark gray. This new hairpiece doesn't suit him at all and the old flat top hair was perfect for him in my opinion, so I don't know why they changed it. The good thing about this change, however, is the fact that this piece is exclusive to this set in that color. Nova on the other hand is spot-on. He comes with a new helmet mold and some nice torso printing. However, he, too, is missing his boots. TLC should have started making dual-colored legs a long time ago. Here are some reference images to compare them to. Okay, so JJJ's hair may not be completely black in the show, but I still think they should have given his minifig a black hairpiece. His suit is also not quite the right color. He rarely appears in person in the show (including the episode this set is based on) and is usually seen on screens around New York, so this is the best picture of him I could find. I guess I should be happy they included a minifig of him at all. In the episode, it was actually Mary Jane who was at the Bugle during Beetle's attack, so it would have made more sense to include her, but we got her in the Spider-copter set one year later, so that's ok. All three of them have back printing. In JJJ's case I'm using that term loosely since it is only comprised of two lines, but it's nice that they went through the trouble of adding them. Both JJJ and Nova come with angry alternate faces. It almost looks like they're trying to out-angry each other. Who do you think looks angrier? Let me know in the comments section below. Now let's talk about the bad guys. Even though he would be better off in a Fantastic Four set, it's great to finally get Victor Van Doom, one of the greatest Marvel villains ever and in comics in general. He comes with a dark green hood which was new and exclusive in that color at the time, and he is the only minifig in this set that has leg printing. Beetle is a regular minifig with wings. The metallic printing on his face and torso is pretty nice, but I wish it would have continued onto his legs as well. The Beetle looks quite accurate to his on-screen counterpart. The only thing that could have improved him is a new helmet mold with pointy eyebrows/antennae. Doctor Doom, however, looks nothing like he does in the movie. I just don't understand how Lego could have messed him up so badly. Maybe they were working off of early concept art or something. Here is a back view of Doom and Beetle. Beetle would be a pretty boring minifig if it wasn't for his wings which are awesome with their holographic texture. They are so mesmerizing, I could look at those things all day. This piece also appeared in trans. light green in the Galaxy Squad sets which came out at the same time. Here they are without their gear. As you can see, they both have back printing as well. And no, Doctor Doom does not come with an alternate facial expression, which is fine since you can't see much of his expressions due to his mask anyway. Here's a look at Dr. Doom and Nova without their headgear. Some say that Doom's face looks too cartoony, but I think it looks fine. Nova is wearing stylish goggles as a way of explaining his white eyes. It's a far better explanation than the Bat-sweatband. They did the same thing with the masked Wolverine later. Here are all the figs with their accessories. JJJ comes with a camera so that he can take ""more pictures of Spider-Man!"" Beetle comes with one of those overused ADU guns which is a very poor representation of his wrist-mounted blasters. I hate to say it, but even those bulky new stud shooters would have been a better representation of his weapons. Spidey comes with his usual string of webbing and Nova comes with some Iron Man style translucent studs. The weird thing is that they are red while his powers have a blue glow in the show. Doctor Doom sadly doesn't get any accessories, but who needs weapons when you have a jet with a claw and flick-fire missiles. The Build The first bag contains Spider-Man, a brick separator, and the parts to build the ground floor of the DBC building. After a quick and straight-forward build, you get this. The dumpster and street lamp are separate from the building and since the lamp post is not built onto any baseplate and is quite top-heavy, it gets knocked over pretty easily. Maybe it's meant to be that way, but I would have preferred it if you could stick it onto the baseplate of the building on which there is unfortunately not enough space to do so. As you would expect, the second bag has the parts for the first floor of the building. This is also the bag that contains Beetle. After another fairly simple build, you'll find yourself with a two story building with a spiderweb one side and a fire escape on the other. However, you have to apply three stickers during this section of the build which is never fun. Can you guess what's in bag number 3? Yup, the second floor of the building. You don't need superpowers to predict that one. Also, this bag contains Nova and Jameson. The build of this section is a bit repetitive since the second floor is mostly the same as the first and it takes slightly longer to build since you have to build the rooftop as well. Also, in addition to the two window stickers you have to apply ten 2x2 tile stickers! Trying to do this without having any of them being crooked is a real pain in the megablocks. The next bag contains Doctor Doom and the cockpit of his jet. Doom's cape is in the usual square white box and the string for the claw is folded up in a piece of tape. Here's what you get at the end of this section. Looks more like an escape pod than a jet at this point. The final bag is the smallest as it only includes the few parts needed to finish the Doom jet. Once you build the wings and tail, you stick them onto the cockpit via Technic pins and you're done. Spare Parts These are the parts that are left over after the build. There is the brick separator of course, an extra antenna, and the usual little bits and bops. What's really awesome, though, is that they give you an extra pair of Beetle's wings! Considering what a neat piece this is and that this is the only set in which it comes in trans-black make this a very welcome spare that you can use in your customs. The Finished Set Here is the complete set. The DBC building looks quite tall, especially when you count the antenna. Comparing it to a screenshot from the episode, the general look of the building is there, although there are some inaccuracies. Aside from the fact that it is obviously way down-scaled, the screens that show JJJ ranting about Spider-Man should have been hexagonal, not square, and should have wrapped around the building. However, considering how many stickers you would have had to apply if they would have made it accurate, I'm actually glad they kept the screen mercifully small. Much like Doctor Doom himself, the Doom jet didn't actually appear in the Beetle Mania episode. However, it did appear in a later episode titled ""Not A Toy"" in which Spider-Man plays around with Captain America's shield, accidentally drops it in Doctor Doom's Latvarian embassy and has to try to retrieve it. And yes, that episode was as godawful as it sounds. Here's a screenshot of the jet from that episode. Like with the DBC, they managed to capture the general shape of the vehicle, although it doesn't look quite as good as in the show. The color scheme is too dark and it looks kind of blockier. Let's take a closer look at the jet. There is no real way to reel the claw in unfortunately. However, there is a stud on the back of the jet that you can stick it onto. Needless to say, this is not the ideal way of storing it. I would have much preferred it if they would have attached it onto winch instead. The engines on the wings can be turned, even though they don't turn in the show, and there is a flick-fire missile on each side. Even if it's not much to look at, at least it's a very swooshable vehicle. On top of each wing there is a tile with the emblem of Latvaria. There was no such emplems on the jet in the cartoon, but they are useful pieces that make it clear whose jet it is, so I'm glad they included them. There is nothing inside the cockpit except for a seat and unless you want to ruin Dr. Doom's nice dark green cape, I wouldn't put him inside of it. They could have at least printed a control panel onto that empty 2x2 tile. Play Features Since this is a playset, let's look at all the play features it has to offer. Like all playsets, the building is open in the back so you can play inside. On the ground floor, there is a potted plant and... nothing else. Seriously? Is this all they could come up with for this floor? They could have included a security desk, a lounge, a second plant, or anything else! As it is, it's just a boring empty lobby. The first floor is a bit more interesting. There is a safe, a swiveling chair, and a pin board with various pictures of Spider-Man. There is one tile that reads: ""The true identity of Spider-Man"" which is supposedly what the villains are after. I wonder how Jameson got this information in the first place. Speaking of Jameson, the second floor is devoted to his office where he can sit and yell at his non-present employees, demanding ""more pictures of Spider-Man!"" It also has a swiveling chair as well as a desk with a lamp and a computer. There is a Technic beam connecting his desk with the ceiling of the first floor which you can remove in order to take off the upper half of the building, but it's difficult to do, so I don't recommend it. As you may have noticed in the picture above, there are a few red pegs sticking out of the building. These are for triggering the play features. Most of them are on the roof. There is one on what looks like an air conditioning unit. If you place Spider-Man holding is web-string on the jumper plate in front of it and push the peg, Spidey goes bungee-jumping off the building. Wee! There is also one that sticks out of the side of the building which when pulled triggers a trap door. The third red peg on the roof can be used to pop off the DBC sign. Why is it called the DBC, you ask? It stands for Daily Bugle Communications since in this version of Spider-Man, the Daily Bugle is not only a newspaper, but a news TV station as well, one that promotes its own highly biased views. So basically the Fox News of the Marvel universe. I guess if you're an old school Spider-Man fan, you could just leave off the ""C"" and have it just stand for Daily Bugle. The sign above the main entrance wont be so easily modified however. There is also a peg between the first and second floor which when pushed pops out one of the windows on the first floor. The safe is only attached to a couple of jumper plates and has some jumper plates on top of it as well, so you can easily attach the Doom jet's claw to it and rip it out of the building as seen on the back of the box. There are also some SNOT bricks on the corners of the building that you can attach spiderwebs or Spidey himself onto for some wall-crawling and webslinging action. This is not so much a play feature as it is just a feature, but as I mentioned earlier, there is a fire escape on the left side of the building. This was a neat idea as it helps it feel like a building in New York City, but it is executed very poorly. There is no hole big enough for the minifigs to climb down through, so they would have to climb down the ladders from the outside which makes no sense. No wonder Spider-Man always needs to rescue people from burning buildings. There is one more play feature in the form of the dumpster. You can open the lid, put a minifig inside, and make them jump by hitting a tab in the back. Remember, this is before the introduction of super jumpers, but nevertheless it's a pretty strange place to launch minifigs out of. I guess even Super Heroes like to do some dumpster diving. You don't think this was funny? No? Well, me neither, but that's the type of humor that this show loves to use. Sigh. Anyway, let's get on to the ratings. Ratings Design: 2/5 - The set looks ok. Despite many inaccuracies, the DBC building and the jet somewhat resemble their on-screen counterparts and don't look too bad, but they definitely could be better. Build: 1/5 - A mostly unchallenging and repetitive build with an attrocious amount of stickers. Minifigs: 4/5 - Definitely the strongest point of the set. Some of the figs could be better, but four out of five of them are exclusive to this set. Doctor Doom is easily the best and probably the most desirable one - unless the Fant4stic movie portraits him so badly that nobody will be interested in him, but that's impossible. Playability: 4/5 - As you would expect from a playset, the playability is quite high, although I still feel like there could have been more. Parts: 3/5 - Not many rare parts. If you're looking for parts for building your own skyscraper with tan walls and lots of doors and windows though, this set is for you. Price: 3/5 - At 476 parts for $50, this set is a bit pricey, but it is somewhat justified by all the large window and wall pieces. Overall: 3/5 - This set is mediocre at best. Playsets are always a good choice for Spider-Man sets since they give Spidey something to swing from, but unfortunately they are rarely pulled off well. The jet is blocky, the building is bare-bones, and the price feels too high. The only reason to get this set are the four exclusive minifigs. This set was discontinued early this year, but if you still see it on clearance somewhere, go ahead and get one for the minifigs and parts, or buy multiples and use the parts to build a better DBC building. I hope you enjoyed this review. It is part of the Reviewers Academy's 7th Anniversary. We're not doing a big celebration this year due to other commitments, but look out for more reviews with the 7th Anniversary banner soon. Now, if you'll excuse me, I am off to see Fant4stic. I hope it's as fantastic as it promises to be! (2 hours later) I was wrong! I was horribly, horribly wrong!"

I'm not usually much of a mini-fig person, but I will admit I bought this set mostly for Dr. Doom (and considered Nova a bonus). Growing up, I was a big fan of the Fantastic Four and an even bigger fan of Dr Doom. I hope that someday the film rights will revert to Marvel and we'll finally get a FF film that respects the original source material and features a Dr Doom worthy of the name. As for the set itself, I don't have much use for playsets (not that there's anything wrong with them, I think the Marvel Lego line could use more of them in fact) and I didn't even realize it was linked to a specific show as I've fallen a bit out of touch with the franchise of late. I bought it; I built it; it sat a shelf for a while; I scrapped it for parts. I think most of it wound up as a greenhouse for my winter village set-up. It's not a _bad_ set, but I think you summed things up nicely when you called it mediocre. Thanks for the entertaining review."

By now many excited LEGO Star Wars fans have started receiving their UCS Falcon. Some of us here enjoy writing reviews and sharing our thoughts. I mentioned to Yoda that I was planning on doing a review of this set but it would likely take me a few weeks (of 1-2 hours per night) to finish building the set. Yoda suggested that I do the review as I go so everyone could see the progress of the set. What a great idea! So, here is the first entry. Feel free to comment along the way. I will try to post photos and updates every night on the build then wrap up the review when I complete the set. If you have any specific questions or photo requests, please be sure to ask. UCS Millennium Falcon Reviewed by Dunamis Set 10179 5195 Pieces $499.95 from LEGO Shop at home The Box: Obviously, this is a box like no other. First of all, it comes in its own shipping carton. Inside of that, there is a standard LEGO carton. Finally, inside the LEGO carton, we have the actual Millennium Falcon box and a nice little letter thanking you for buying the biggest LEGO set ever. Shipping box (Naboo set provided for scale) LEGO Carton and letter LEGO Carton The Millennium Falcon box is really quite nice. There are lots of photos and it does a good job of ?selling? the set. There are 8 individual pieces of tape that keep the lid on the box. The limited first edition comes with a seal on the lower left corner. Millennium Falcon Box (Naboo set provided for scale) Lifting the lid straight up reveals one compartment of several bags on the right. On the left, we find a thin, square box (like a pizza box) that contains the official certificate of authenticity, two sticker sheets and one enormous manual! Under the pizza box, we find two more compartments each filled with several typical LEGO bags. The box weighs 24 pounds! Stickers Pizza Box Pieces in compartments Not quite sure what the little 30th anniversary sticker is for yet. The Certificate of Authenticity is on heavy paper and is suitable for framing. More to come tomorrow. It's late here."

It is spiral bound with a cardboard like front and back and it is 314 pages. Interesting decision not to break it up into multiple manuals. It is almost unwieldy at this size and thickness. Unfortunately, the manual is not available electronically from the LEGO website. Hopefully, it will be soon. Missing were the little instructions at the beginning telling you to not build this beast on shag carpet and to sort out the 5,000+ pieces before you get started. I guess they figure if you got $500 to spend on this thing, you can build it however you want. As usual, we get the regular LEGO manual features: - Piece call outs for each step - Parts inventory at the end of the manual - Page numbers - Photos of all the other 2007 sets at the end of the manual Manual (paperback book provided for scale) Various manual photos (8x8 plate provided for scale) I'm about 2 hours into building and sorting. I'm trying to stay a day ahead in my posting. The build has been easier than I thought so far. Despite the massive number of pieces, it has not been too hard to sort and find what you need. Build photos will start appearing in tomorrow's entry."

So this leads me to believe that dimension-wise the UCS MF is more compact. Also, notice how in the content, the parts fit in just nice without additional spare space for anything else. Strange isn't it that when TLC is responsible for the shipping, we see optimum usage of box spaces. X-D imagine if all boxes were this efficient. $4.99 sets would be no bigger than a match box!

I am sorting as I open the bags that I need. Some bags are in multiples so it is easy to pick them out. The build is a tad repetitive as the framework of the ship is somewhat symmetrical. Here are some progress shots: Note that two plates (1x4 and 1x8) are stacked in between Technic beams. Then the part below is assembled to hold the structure together. This took about an hour of sorting and building: I'll post another update tomorrow.

They even throw in an extra fleshie head! No doubt these will fetch quite a bit on the Bricklink and Ebay markets. I?m keeping mine. Continuing the Build This photo shows how well this model is put together. Notice that they use four of the three-hole beams per side to hold this together. I remember reading that you can hang this model from the ceiling. I don?t doubt it. These right angle Technic pieces are used to reinforce the structure of the model. You can see them used here: I was shocked at how many light gray plates are in this set. I have TWO tubs full of these: The infrastructure is now complete: I got hung up for about an hour looking for one of these: Turns out, LEGO gave me an extra left wedge and shorted me a right wedge.

All the parts. If you want tan, this is the set to get! Main model. The garage is a great addition... ...but the car only just fits! The main house is very nice looking. The windows extend to the sides... ...but not the back. The chimney and drainage work very well, and I love the ""basement"". I think the front works very well. When I was making this I was multitasking doing weight training; do a set, do a step, do a set... and I ended up missing one of the row paths. I discovered this after I finished the basement. :-| The removable roof reveals BYO floors. Probably why this is called a Model house! The roof was quite interesting to build. This is my first large house set so it all was very new to me. I love the garage door. More nice pipework. This photo I mis-focused but there isn't much to see anyway! The door is a nice touch. The grill to the right on both sides is not just decoration as it hides the hinges for the door. I also made one of the sub-models. I was considering keeping this but I decided against it. Once again the sides have windows... but the back doesn't. The truck is there to make the photo more worthwhile! The roof to this one doesn't come off easily as all the tiles are used for the front. Just to clarify; these houses aren't attached so you can arrange them however you want. The fronts are quite elaborate and it seems that Lego were trying to make this almost like a simpler market street. The truck is too small for a minifig... ...but it probably was my favourite car. Thoughts I highly recommend this set. In most countries it is good value for money, including Australia. The design is excellent and three instructions are included. (The third is a school. If anyone has made it and wants to post photos feel free! At least one person at EB has made it.) I love how each house has its own car. Due to the way the primary model is made it is a bit weak at the corner, but that was a design choice. My only real complaint about this set is how Lego is going though a mould transition and thus some roof slopes are rough, others are smooth. I can accept either, and Lego has been moving to smooth slopes for years now, but to have a set with about 50/50 is annoying. (The MTT was the same.) But that is my only gripe with this excellent set. *wub*"

Holodoc, on Sep 28 2007, 07:58 PM, said: Thanks for the review Sinner! *y* ... although we had a not very detailed one already... :-P I notice that, but since didn't show what the original set looked like I saw that more of a MOC. 8-| Holodoc, on Sep 28 2007, 07:58 PM, said: You get tons of useful parts to build other buildings as well. [shameless self-promotion /OFF] ;-) I was actually considering adding a link to your MOC anyway. Thanks! :-P paul_delahaye, on Sep 29 2007, 07:38 AM, said: I too have bought this set and the only thing I notice which is a bit odd, with the exception of there being no floors in the house is the lack of a steering wheel in the car! Once again, I think this is just a sign of all style, no substance! :-D PaulC, on Sep 29 2007, 05:19 PM, said: The mixed rough and smooth roof bricks would annoy me on a model like the MTT, but here it looks as is if the roof is quite old with some parts being worn and pitted and some parts being replaced with new roof tiles. I quite like the effect. Fair point. What confuses me though is the (CG) cover has the rough ones shown... :-|"

I am glad that I had read this review in advance, before making my purchase on this set earlier with my girlfriend. We built this set for a total of 3 hours, to complete this beauty, in about 2 hours ago. There are stars circling around my head at this very moment, when I post this reply. I must admit from the bottom of my heart, that this is an wonderful piece of house, that simply shows the beauty of it, with the European kind of houses, where there is a garage. Furthermore, there is a lovely blue car. I am seeing stars right now, in the middle of the night, and I must drop a thanks to you personally as well. Although it is empty from its interior unlike the 4996 Beach House, but this set has the majestic look which simply place a ""Wow"" factor in front of it upon completion. At the moment, we had plans for getting the second set next month, to build the other design as well. Hopefully, I will be able to share with you guys, all of my different Creators sets, with its alternate designs as well in the near future."

Well, somehow things didn?t work out, but fortunately I?m finally reviewing my latest purchases, starting with 7091 Catapault Defense, which happens to be one of the best sets in the Castle line. The Box and Instructions: Lego box art is at it?s highest point ever these days, with lots of special effects and great action poses. The castle theme is no exception, and 7091 isn?t either. I?ll let the box speak for itself: I love the back of the castle boxes as well, since they give another action scene and other neat info like a layout of all the accessories. The Contents: Only the bare essentials as usual: piece bags and instructions. I seriously wish they still put mini catalogs inside sets like they did when I was young, but I guess they are too expensive to make or something. Ah well, can?t have everything. No picture of the instructions this time, but since that isn?t necessary I?ll just say that they are fine, and do not have a problem with distinguishing dark gray from black. The Pieces: Here?s your basic shot of every piece included, minus a few extra pieces like an extra Viking horn and black skeleton leg. Not too shabby for a 10 USD set. There?s a lot of nice pieces in 7091, as you can see (and this doesn?t include the accessories or minifig parts!). The brown plates, wheels, and spoked things are always useful, and the dark blue and gold slopes are really cool. However, there?s also a fair amount of technic in here, so be warry. As usual for the castle line, 7091 has a heaping helping of accessories. Most of them are old pieces recolored, but the ball on chain (what?s the actual name, could someone tell me?) and the shields are brand new. I actually like the new skeleton weapon, since it?s fairly detailed and was really the only way TLC could make a part like that. And yes, the shields ARE printed (quite nicely too, if I do say so myself). Plus, you get Viking horns (always useful to have), a grey boulder, a basket, and 3 helmets. Not a half bad deal, eh? Oh, who am I kidding ? it?s awesome! Minifigures: Ah yes, one of the highlights of any castle set. You get 2 soldiers and 2 skellies this time, all with different weapons. The two soldiers are just regular Crown troops with different faces ? nothing special, except that they are awesome anyway. The skeletons on the other hand are much more interesting: an archer and a black skellie! Archers cool, of course, but I know many don?t like the printing on the black skeletons. Well, let me say that I don?t mind it so much. The only real problem is that the eyes are dark red instead of just red, which makes the printing a bit less noticeable. And I?ve been through it before that the new skeleton molds in general don?t bother me at all ? go skeletons! The Finished Set: Alright, there?s two builds in this set, and I?ll start with the smaller: the skeleton barricade. Okay, so it?s nothing special, but it?s cool all the less. The shield on the front and the slanted spears are nice touches. Here?s just how the skeletons can tower over their own barricade: with a little step. Ah, the catapault. The lovely catapault. Seriously, I love TLC?s design. Very effective, and also very realistic, especially compared to KK. Love the side details and the swiveling base, and you gotta love the clever use of that basket. Playability: Yes, I?ve made it a tradition now to write stories for any castle set I buy (and this isn?t the last one, you can be sure of that!). Here?s one featuring everything in 7901: Oh, and here?s a small ship I made out of all the pieces in this set plus a couple extra figures and weapons from my copy of 7901. Not half bad, IMO, considering what I had to work with. Overall Rating: Presentation: 9/10 Pieces: 8/10 Minifigures: 9/10 Finished model: 9/10 Playability: 8/10 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Final Score: 8.6/10 Once again, I highly recommend the reviewed set. Castle is possibly the best theme this year, and this set is one of many that prove it. As with all castle sets, it?s best if you buy several if you want to truly enjoy it, but this set alone is also impressive in both design and pieces and minifigures. Get at least one if you have even a slight liking for Castle. Edited by KimT, 10 August 2008 - 01:31 PM."

This is also the time when The Lego Group releases their latest Winter Village set which has been an annual tradition for the past seven years. These sets have been very popular, especially among AFOLs, and are always highly anticipated. However, while some entries in this series have been more popular than others, none has been as controversial as this year's set, the Winter Toy Shop, which is a re-release of the first Winter Village set, 10199 Winter Toy Shop from 2009. It seems that many think that this set didn't need to be remade and would have preferred a new set instead, or that it is not different enough from the original and will be redundant in a completionist's collection. Does it deserve all the hate? Let's find out. Disclaimer: I don't own the 2009 version, so I can't compare them visually, but I will do my best to let you know what is different in this version. If you do need a visual reference, you can refer to Svelte's excellent review of the original. Set Number: 10249 Name: Winter Toy Shop Theme: Creator Year of Release: 2015 Pieces: 898 Minifigs: 8 Price: £59.99 / $79.99 / 69.99€ S@H description: Quote Welcome to the Winter Toy Shop! The holiday season has arrived and the toymaker is busy finishing off his latest creations! Outside, children ski and snowboard, and a freshly built snowman sparkles in the light that shines from the toyshop tower. Help decorate the huge tree that stands at the center of the square, play with the curious kitten on the cozy wooden bench or join in with the carolers beneath the ornate streetlamp. This charming set also features a ladder, trees in various sizes, jack-in-the-box, a toy biplane, helicopter, rocket, train, race car, truck, robot, tugboat, teddy bear and a wrapped gift. Have fun building this enchanting winter wonderland! Includes a snowman and 8 minifigures with assorted accessories: a male caroler, female caroler, a woman, 2 men, 2 boys and a girl. S@H Bricklink Brickset The Box The box art of this set is similar to that of the original, but there are some notable differences. The Christmas tree is on the right side of the image this time while the park bench is on the left and of course it features this year's design for Creator boxes with the dark blue stripe along the right side and the ""Expert"" logo in the top right corner. There's also a small picture of the back of the toy shop and the background looks less cartoony than on the original. The back is also very similar, showing a different angle of the toy shop along with some close-ups, although this time there is no minifig lineup. Instead, the minifig lineup is on the right side of the box. It also includes the accessories that each minifig comes with and some of the toys. On the left side of the box there is a thumbnail of the box art and the set name in six different languages. They also want to make sure that you know that there are batteries included by saying it in dozens of languages. The top of the box features the inventory and a 1:1 scale reference with the female caroler. On the bottom there is a picture that reminds you that there is a light brick included in this set, in case that wasn't clear from the front of the box, and it confirms that yes, it is a bad idea to put it in water, in case you were planning to go swimming with your Winter Toy Shop. The Contents Inside the box there are two instruction booklets and two groups of bags, one for each instruction booklet. While two groups of bags is not as many as there usually are in other sets of this size, it's still better than the first version of this set where the bags weren't numbered at all, so this makes the build a bit easier. The large bag in Group 1 and the two large bags in Group 2 have a white stripe going down the middle of the bag and only have one group number printed on it along with some other number and some kind of scan code. I have no idea why they made this distinction for these bags or what that code is for, so if any of you know the purpose of this, please let me know in the comments below. Here is a random instructions page. As you can see, the building steps can get quite challenging as they sometimes include many different pieces in one step, especially when it uses a lot of brown pieces which are very dark and hard to see in the instructions, living up to the set's status as an expert-level set. Most of the time, though, the instructions are pretty clear and easy enough to follow. There are some parts in new colors in this set that weren't in the first version or any other set until now, such as that large, flat Technic arch in dark green, the jester hat in orange and blue, one of those new 2z2 round jumper tiles in brown, a golden frog(!), and a snowboard in dark blue. There are also some rare Friends parts that make their Creator debut here such as the skis in azure and that new clear 1x1 round tile with a tiny tube coming out of it which is usually used as a stand for Friends accessories and is a very useful piece, especially for SNOT techniques (and no, I'm not talking about the type of snot that many people usually have stuck in their nose around this time of year). There are some printed parts as well, such as the clock tile, the letter tile, and the register slope like in the first version of the set. We also get a new face print for the white cat which is more in line with other modern cat designs. But the best part is the shop sign which is printed this time around. It features a lovely wood pattern, the words ""toy shop"", and a toy soldier on both sides of the sign. Which is ironic since the shop doesn't seem to sell any toy soldiers like this, but it looks so good on the sign that I won't sue them for false advertising. The Minifigs Let's start with the most unique figures in this set, the carolers. These two were also the highlight in the first version of the set, but in the original they both had the same head (this one -> ) which featured a very questionable facial expression that could easily be taken out of context. In this version, they have unique faces which look much better and help distinguish their gender. The male caroler uses Lord Vampyre's torso which looks quite snazzy on him. Maybe this is Lord Vampyre before he became a vampire? The female caroler is easily the best minifig in the set, though, because in addition to her exclusive head, she also gets an exclusive torso and skirt print! A huge improvement over the generic unprinted one in the original. She also gets the queen hair in dark brown and Aragorn's lined cape instead of two combined regular capes. This set truly is the Return of the Queen! The snowman is technically not a minifig, but as you can see here, he is exactly as tall as one and he is the first thing you build after the minifigs, so I included him here. He has mostly the same design as before, except this time he has robot claws for arms instead of levers. Which is good since they allow him to hold accessories such as his broom. His carrot nose is included separately again. The carolers both have back printing while the snowman looks no different from the back than he does from the front. Here you can see the black side of the female's cape. This lined cape is so much nicer than the solution they used in the original. Next up we have what I assume is a married couple who are likely the parents of at least one of the kids, as well as the toymaker who I will call Geppetto. The man in the pinstripe suit was not included in the first version of the set, so he's a bonus minifig! These guys are fairly generic, but they have some detailed torso prints, so they look pretty nice. Geppetto seems to have gotten younger since the release of the original set since his gray hair has now turned dark tan and he doesn't seem to need glasses anymore. The men both have back printing, but the woman is the only one in this set who doesn't get a back print. Why you gotta be so discriminating against women, LEGO?! Last but not least, there are the kids. One of the boys wears dark blue pants, a green jacket, and a wool cap. He looks a bit like a lumberjack, so let's call him lumberjack boy, or Jack for short. The little girl wears an outfit that wouldn't look out of place in the Friends theme with a lavender scarf and pants. I'll call her Lavender. The second boy is wearing an Octan jacket and a sports helmet which makes it ironic that he is the one not doing any winter sports on the box art. I'll call him President Business Junior, or PBJ for short. All of the kids have fairly detailed back printing which makes up for the fact that much like the adults, they are made out of mostly common parts. PBJ's helmet and scarf cover up the back of his head nicely which is important as you will see in the next picture. What's also great about these figs is that half of them have a double-sided head. Here you can see PBJ doing his best Macaulay Culkin impression. I also removed his scarf so you can see the printing on his torso better. But he's not the only one who seems to be easily scared. The mother also has a very alarmed expression. Maybe she got surprised by the Jack-in-the-box or maybe she just realized how expensive toys are nowadays. You can see the female caroler's back printing here. Her alternate expression is a non-singing face which is very nice to have and I wish the male caroler could have one too. She looks quite cute with those rosy cheeks. But the most adorable out of all of them has to be the little girl. She comes with a pouting sad face that will melt your heart. Please, don't cry! I'll buy you any toy you want, just stop looking at me like that! The Build The first half of the build is dedicated to the surroundings of the toy shop. It includes the Christmas tree, the park bench, the snowman, the toys, the carolers, Jack and Lavender. The large bag contains two smaller bags with small pieces, a white box that contains the caroler's cape, and the jester hat in its own little bag. The first thing you build after the minifigs and the snowman is the toys. This version of the set has a lot more toys than the original which is good because I always felt that the first Toy Shop was a bit light on toys. Also, the ones that were in the original have been updated. For example, instead of the two pairs of skis, you now get one pair of skis that use the new ski mold and a snowboard. The Jack-in-the-box is mostly the same, except it now has an orange and blue color scheme instead of the red and blue from the original. This change was probably not necessary, but hey, at least we get a new jester hat out of it. And instead of the brick-built teddy bear you get the new teddy bear mold. I have mixed feelings about this change because I actually kinda liked the brick-built teddy design and using a specialized mold seems to be going against the spirit of Creator sets, but on the other hand I can't deny that the molded teddy looks better than the blocky old one. Meh. The new toys include a tugboat which has some rounded Technic pieces as its hull, a biplane, a rocket, a helicopter, and a truck that cleverly uses roller skates for its wheels. These are all quite brilliant designs that feel like micro versions of Lego City sets and make a great addition to the set. Here is a back view of some of the more complex models. As you can see, the Friends accessory stand has been cleverly used to hold the biplane's fin in place and to provide a stand for the helicopter. The Jack-in-the-box has a hinged lid. The only thing that bugs me a bit is the T-piece on top of the helicopter that holds the rotor in place, but I can't think of any better way they could have done it. Next is the ladder that is used to decorate the tree which is exactly the same as the first version. The supports are on a click-hinge, so they can be adjusted or folded away. Then, you build the tree itself. You begins, of course, with the stand which is mostly the same design as before, but this time the plates at the bottom are brown instead of white and have golden studs as feet. Next, you build the first layer of branches. The main difference in this version of the tree is that this one actually has a brown stem rather than just a Technic axle on which you stack the layers of branches one by one. You wont be able to see the stem in the final result, but I like this change as it makes the tree more realistic. Then you add the second layer of branches. This one doesn't have lights/candles and attaches to the lower layer at an angle using the four trans-yellow studs close to the stem. The third layer is added. This one has lights again. Each layer is similar in that they are all made out of green plates that are built around a 4x4 ring plate, but they get smaller each time and are constructed differently enough for the build not to feel repetitive. With the addition of the fourth layer, we get close to finishing the tree. Lastly, you add one more layer and the tip of the tree. Now it's time to decorate the tree! However, it's not as fun as it sounds since that requires you to add lights to the two chains/ropes first which can get a bit repetitive. The clips holding the lights to the chain were white, but this time they're pearl gold which looks much nicer in my opinion. The next part of the build is the park bench with the streetlamp and the little tree. This is a fairly quick build with not much to it. The fishbowl helmet parts are a useful piece that you don't see too often, so it's nice to get them again in this remake. The design is pretty much the same as in the original set except for the wreaths on the streetlamp which use a green life preserver instead of a round 2x2 plate. This is another instance where they use a specialized piece instead of a brick-built solution, but I'm okay with that because unlike with the teddy bear, this part was not originally intended to be a wreath, so it's still nice part usage. The second half of the build is dedicated to the toy shop itself and includes the couple, Geppetto, and PBJ. Please note that there is a fourth 6x10 plate burried under the parts. You begin by tiling the floor, setting up the walls, and adding the interior items such as the fireplace, the cash register, and the toy displays. Next, you add the walls, windows, and the door and the ground floor of the shop is finished. So far, the build is the same as the old toy shop, except this time they decided to have the white stripes on the marquees be the longer ones instead of the dark red ones for some reason. I don't know why they did this and kinda would have preverred to get dark red 1x1 plates instead of white, but it doesn't detract from the look of the shop, so I don't really care. Now we begin with the upper floor. This is where things start to look a little different. Can you tell the difference? The difference is that this time they attach the roof using clip-hinges instead of bulky Technic constructions which gives you more space on this floor and allows it to look more like an actual attic. They even tile the floor next to the frog clock. Aftter adding the roof, the build is finished. The main roof feels a bit loose since it's only attached to the building by one side. I'm not sure if this was an issue in the old toy shop, but it's not a big deal. I just wouldn't pick the set up by the roof. What I do like is that they used double cheese slopes on the awning on the outer wall of the tower instead of singles which makes it a bit easier to build. I like how the supports under the tower roof now match those of the main roof. The wreaths have also been updated like the ones on the streetlamp. And those Technic arches under the roof look a lot more like garlands now. On the original, they were dark gray, so I didn't even know they were supposed to be garlands and assumed they were part of the architecture. The shop sign looks a lot better now that it is printed. The old one just looked like a white flag. I also like how the small plates under the marquee give it a wavy look and they included two trees in different sizes on the right side of the shop. The back is nice and open and allows you to see the rest of the toys, the robot, train, and race car, all of which have just as much of a simple and clever design as the other toys. The clock looks much nicer with the new golden frog. Because golden frogs make everything better. Spare Parts There are quite a few small parts left over, including a roller skate and one of those Friends accessory stands which will come in handy. The Complete Set Here you can see the full set together. It looks quite nice and festive with all the little details and there are many scenes that you can play out with it: You can have the minifigs decorate the tree, have the kids play in the snow, have the carolers sing by the bench, have the toymaker build some toys in his workshop, or have the parents buy presents for their kids. It's a festive, toy-filled Winter Wonderland! The fireplace looks cozy and I like the brick pattern going up the chimney. The entrance of the shop looks a bit empty aside from the cash register. I feel like they could have displayed some more toys here, but oh well. Being a set targeted at teens and adults, there aren't really any play features aside from the light brick which is attached to a hinge, so you can either activate it by pressing the button with your finger or tilting the brick upward so that the button is pressed against the roof. However, since the roof is not connected in the middle and only attached on the sides, it tends to split open a bit when you do that, so I'm not sure if attaching the roof this way here was such a good idea. Nevertheless, it looks quite nice when the light is lit. Ratings Design: 5/5 - This set is as gorgeous as it was back in 2009! The small updates that they made are mostly good ones, although the absence of a brick-built teddy is a bit disappointing and the new way the roof is attached, while not as bulky as before, makes the roof slightly unstable, but those are just nitpicks. Build: 5/5 - There are some interesting building techniques here, such as those on the tree, the roof, and the toys. The fact that the parts are only split into two groups and the part callouts can get fairly complex makes it a challenging, enjoyable build. Minifigs: 5/5 - They did a great job updating the figs in this set. While only 3 of the torsos in the original had any printing, all of the torsos have printing front and back in this set, even the skirt and cape of the female caroler. You get two exclusive heads and half of the heads are double-sided, plus you get 8 instead of 7 minifigs. You really can't ask for more in a Creator set. Playability: 4/5 - This set is more meant to be displayed than to be played with, but there are plenty of things to play with if you want. All the different minifigs, accessories, and set pieces make for endless possibilities for play. It's especially fun to swoosh the micro vehicles around. Parts: 3/5 - There are lots of good parts here. Most of them are fairly common, but there are some rare parts and some even in exclusive colors. Price: 4/5 - This set costs $20 more than the original, but considering that this set has nearly 900 pieces, including some rare and exclusive ones, as well as more minifigs with much better printing, I think $80 is still a fair price. Overall: 5/5 - So what's my opinion of this set? For a remake, I think it's great. They managed to make a good set even better. Are the changes minor? Yes. Are they an improvement? Mostly, yes. Were they necessary? Perhaps not, but it's good that they made them instead of just re-releasing the exact same set. So if you didn't get the first Winter Toy Shop, I can highly recommend getting this one. If you do already have the old version, this one might still be worth picking up for the hugely improved minifigs and rare parts alone. As for the controversy over re-releasing the Winter Toy Shop, I can see where the haters are coming from, but I find their complaints to be quite petty. I can understand if you're disappointed because you already have the first Winter Toy Shop and were looking forward to a new set this year, but there's always next year. If you're a completist and feel like TLG is forcing you to buy a set you don't need, you're wrong. Nobody is forcing you to buy anything but yourself. If you decide to buy every set in a theme no matter what it is, that's your problem, not LEGO's. So put down your torches and pitchforks and just be glad that they improved the set design and gave us another chance to buy this classic set. There are far worse things that can happen in this world than Lego re-releasing one of their most popular sets. Sorry for that little rant. So what is your opinion on re-releases like this? Please cast your vote in the poll above. I hope you enjoyed this special Eurobricks Reviewers Academy review and would like to thank The Lego Group for the opportunity to review this set.

I do like the upgrades and changes made from the original 2009 set, more colours and parts are offcourse available today than back in 2009. It does look like a great set and i would really realy have loved to get it myself if i had the funds. However their are so many other sets thats first priority for me this december and next year, so sadly i might have to pass on this if its not that i can get it redicioulusly cheap at some point. And yeah, we should appreciate that LEGO does keep sets coming, even if its just upgrades from earlier releases. Town is known for a new police and fire station every year, cant see why a new toyshop is so upsetting. Once again thanks for a great review. And happy holidays to you as well."

I just built the original, and this one has clear advantages over the original (though I wish Lego would stop putting torsos with defined breasts and curves on children). I really like pretty much every change. I won't be getting it, and I'd be lying if I said I'm not a little disappointed. For the first four years, my mother-in-law got me the new winter village set for Christmas; after the last two, which didn't really fit thematically in my display, I had hoped for a new one--particularly since my daughter is getting to be around the age where she can play with them. I mention her specifically because I've seen lots of people dismiss those who are a bit disappointed as rabid adults who don't care about kids getting cool sets, and I don't think that's fair. I may have to see how much some of the parts go for on Bricklink. The rerelease is better than the original, but not good enough that I'd want to spend $80 to get a set that's nearly identical to one I have. Edited by Tea Weevil, 29 November 2015 - 04:31 PM."

I didn't realise there were quite as many changes as you highlighted (tree, roof etc)."

It doesn't seem to have lots of functionality, but maybe the landing gear is retractable. This set kind of reminds me to the 9394 - Jet Plane, although it's obviously a lot smaller. As you can read in my review of the 42052 - Heavy Lift Helicopter basically anything flying is +1 for me, so let's find out if this set also fits the bill. Note: All images can be clicked for hi-res versions. SET INFORMATION Number: 42044 Title: Display Team Jet Theme: Technic Released: 2016 Part Count: 113 Box Weight: 193 gr Box Dimensions: 15,4 cm x 13,8 cm x 5,9 cm Set Price (MSRP): € 9,99 Price per Part: € 0,088 Links: Brickset, Bricklink THE BOX Being a small set, it obviously comes in a small box. The Display Team Jet is an Aerobatics Jet, used in air shows. On the box it's flying rather high, but at least it's at a safe distance from the crowd. Front side shows the main model, together with a small section indicating you can use Digital Building instructions to build this model. BACK SIDE The back side shows the B-model, a Stunt Plane. And again a reference to the apps for Digital Building instructions. More on the Stunt Plane later. CONTENT OF THE BOX The box contains: 2 Instructions Booklets (A- and B-model) 1 Sticker Sheet 3 Technic Liftarms 2 Bags INSTRUCTION BOOKLETS Both the instructions for the A- and B-model are included in the box. STICKER SHEET A lot of stickers for such a small set. Apparently no panel is left untouched. LIFTARMS Three liftarms unsealed, nothing out of the ordinary for a small set. BAGS Two bags containing the rest of the parts. HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This section describes the new and/or otherwise interesting parts. YELLOW 5L AXLES The 5L Axle in Yellow has never been released before, so it's one of the new parts for this year. BLACK 7L FLEX AXLES For the layman this seems a common part, but the 7L Soft Axle actually has never been released in black before. Combined with the re-release of the 19L Soft Axle in black, this will open up lots of possibilities. For those of you thinking you've read this text before; you are right, the new Drag Racer contains these new 7L Flex Axles too. WHITE PANELS This small set comes with a whopping 10 panels. Great for the ones who like panels. Not so great if you think TLG is using too much panels lately. RUDDER This part, the Small Bionicle Wing, is the same as the one used in last year's 42033 - Record Breaker. PART LIST This set contains 113 parts, all listed below. THE BUILD This is the collection of parts, used to build the Jet. It sure looks like we are getting a landing gear. The build is fun, but pretty straightforward. There aren't any special or cool techniques used in this set. It almost took me more time to apply all the stickers than to build the actual model. FINISHED MODEL The finished Jet does look cool though. The white and yellow color scheme, combined with the stickers, work really well. I have seen people refer to the plane as being orange, but it's definitely yellow. Technic (or LEGO in general) tends to have some color variation when it comes to yellow. I do concur this is the warmer variant of yellow, but it's not orange. The back of the plane looks nice too, although I am not a big fan of the rudder part. It looks too detailed, compared to the other panels. It's not a big deal though, and maybe it's just me. PARTS LEFT Only three common parts left. FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS This set has a single feature and that is a retractable landing gear. It's operated by the black 12T Double Bevel Gear near the cockpit. In the following picture you can see the landing gear retracted. This image shows the landing gear when the plane is ready for landing. Hopefully the pilot will roll the plane before landing, but you probably know what I mean VIDEO Here's s short video demonstrating the Display Team Jet. B-MODEL This set also includes the building instructions for the B-model, a Stunt Plane. The building experience for the Stunt Plane is more or less the same as for the Jet. Well, what do you expect when both models are planes with a limited number of parts. For an alternative model the Stunt Plane looks fine. There's not a lot of functionality in this plane, but it's worth mentioning that the tail wheel allows the plane to roll on a flat surface. The plane also has working propellors. Both functions are demonstrated in the video. Unfortunately, the landing gear of the Stunt Plane is not retractable. PARTS LEFT A couple of extra leftover parts, but it's nice to see that most of the parts have been used in the B-model as well. Actually, there's probably an extra yellow Technic Smooth 1/2 Bush left. I just found it on my desk, but it could belong to one of the other sets. VIDEO Here's a video demonstrating the Stunt Plane. SUMMARY Two nice planes for 13 bucks, that's basically what you get. Both models look good and the set has some interesting new parts. Especially the 7L Flex Axle will be very popular. It comes with a decent collection of white panel, although they are very common nowadays. Both models have limited functionality, but each of them has at least one function to give the model some playability for kids, other than the swooshability that is. Okay, it might lack some proper functions, but I still think kids will love this set. I can see kids running around with one of the planes in their hands. All in all I think this set delivers what you'd expect. SCORE Let's see how this set flies! Remember that the grades are based on it being a small set. Obviously a set like this, cannot be compared with a Mercedes flagship. 8 DESIGN For a small set, the model looks very authentic. 7 BUILDING EXPERIENCE No surprises. 7 FEATURES Just the retractable landing gear. 8 PLAYABILITY It has swooshability, so I see kids running around with this model. 7 PARTS Lots of panels, if you are into that. 8 VALUE FOR MONEY Can't go wrong with these small sets. 7,5 FUN FOR KIDS More image can be found on my Flickr page. Thank you for reading. I hope you enjoyed it."

It is much bigger than it looks from the box - about 30 studs long. There is only one function - the landing gear - but it works very nicely.

The pullback motor allows the model to be pulled back, followed by forward motion. Usually there's no apparent relation between the two set, other than the ability to combine them into an alternate build. This year there seems to some sort of Cops and Robbers scene going on. A Getaway Racer and a Police Interceptor. That can't be a coincidence. Makes you wonder who will be victorious, the good guys or the bad guys. Let's find out! Note: All images can be clicked for hi-res versions. SET INFORMATION Number: 42046 Title: Getaway Racer Theme: Technic Released: 2016 Part Count: 170 Box Weight: 302 gr Box Dimensions: 26,0 cm x 13,8 cm x 5,9 cm Set Price (MSRP): € 19,99 Price per Part: € 0,118 Links: Brickset, Bricklink THE BOX The box has the same dimensions as previous year's pullback motor sets. In the lower right corner there's a visual explanation of the pullback mechanism. The dark model with it's decals sure looks like a cool hot rod. CONTENT OF THE BOX The box contains: 1 Instructions Booklet 1 Sticker Sheet 2 Technic Liftarms 1 Pullback Motor 3 Bags INSTRUCTION BOOKLET Just a single booklet. Unfortunately no booklet for the alternate model. STICKER SHEET The sticker sheet contains a lot of cool stickers with flames and skulls etc. PULLBACK MOTOR AND LIFTARMS The pullback motor and two liftarms are found unbagged. BAGS A total of three bags containing the majority of the parts. HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This section describes the new and/or otherwise interesting parts. Actually, this set is the only set of 1H 2016 which doesn't use any new parts, not even parts in a new color. TIRES The Getaway Racer uses four low profile tires (Tire 37 x 22 ZR). RIMS The rims are Wheel 30.4mm D. x 20mm in Pearl Gold, found in 12 other sets. PANELS This set contains three #3 Panelsand three #4 Panels in black. PART LIST This set contains 171 parts, all listed below. THE BUILD This being a small model, I won't show any building steps. Let's skip right to the finished model. Below you can see the end result. In my opinion the model looks great. It's got that hot rod vibe going on and the stickers add darkness to the vibe. Slight problem with this set is that it really needs the stickers to finish the look. Otherwise it's quite dull, with black and dark grey liftarms and panels. The rear view shows the pullback motor connected directly to the rear axle. In this image you can also clearly see the exhaust pipes on the side, which are very well executed. The 3x3 Technic Discs with stickers, used in the rim, result in only seeing a part of the rim. This works very well with the golden rims. The bottom view shows the chassis of the car. Nothing really noteworthy, as you would expect from a pullback set. VIDEO The following video gives you an overview of the finished model. PARTS LEFT These six parts are left after building the model. Seems about right. FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS This being a pullback motor set, it only has a single feature. The video below demonstrates the acceleration of the vehicle. My girlfriend was kind enough to catch the model before it fell to the ground. Or did it hit something before it fell to the ground?! VIDEO This video shows the pullback functionality. B-MODEL The alternate model is a combined build with the Police Interceptor, which you can see on the back of the box. Unfortunately the instructions for the combined B-model are not included, so I didn't get a chance to build it. This would make for a fun challenge, building the B-model without the instructions. SUMMARY Pullback sets are not the most technically advanced models, so you can't expect any other functionality than hitting the walls in your house. However, I think they are very appealing to kids. The fact that this year's pullback sets form a duo adds to the fun. In my opinion TLG hit the nail on the head with the Getaway Racer and Police Interceptor. The Getaway Racer looks very badass, which is something you don't see every day in a Technic set. SCORE How do I grade the bad guy in this year's duo. 8 DESIGN It looks so cool, but it does need the stickers. 7 BUILDING EXPERIENCE Nothing out of the ordinary. 7 FEATURES Limited to the pullback-and-drive functionality. 7 PLAYABILITY Combined with the Police Interceptor, kids will love it. It does need it's Nemesys though. 7 PARTS Collection of common parts. Gold rims could be interesting. 8 VALUE FOR MONEY Pullback sets always deliver a certain value. 7,3 HIT IT!

Note: All images can be clicked for hi-res versions. SET INFORMATION Number: 42047 Title: Police Interceptor Theme: Technic Released: 2016 Part Count: 185 Box Weight: 325 gr Box Dimensions: 26,0 cm x 13,8 cm x 5,9 cm Set Price (MSRP): € 19,99 Price per Part: € 0,108 Links: Brickset, Bricklink THE BOX The box has the same dimensions as previous year's pullback motor sets. In the lower right corner there's a visual explanation of the pullback mechanism. Lime green might seem unusual for a police car, but it might work out better than expected. CONTENT OF THE BOX The box contains: 1 Instructions Booklet 1 Sticker Sheet 2 Technic Liftarms 1 Pull-back Motor 3 Bags INSTRUCTION BOOKLET The instruction booklet for the main model. Unfortunately no booklet for the alternate model. STICKER SHEET The sticker sheet shows similar lime green details as found in the rest of the model. PULL-BACK MOTOR AND LIFTARMS The pull-back motor and liftarms haven't been sealed in plastic bags. BAGS Three bags containing the rest of the parts. HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This section describes the new and/or otherwise interesting parts. 7L AXLE IN YELLOW The 7L Axle has never been released in yellow before. This year TLG surprised us with releasing axles in different colors, like yellow, red and orange. This set only contains a yellow 7L Axle, but you can checkout my other reviews to see which other axles have been (re)released. This 7L Axle has also been used in the Drag Racer. LIME GREEN PARTS The 30.4mm D. x 20mm Wheels are unique to this set. They have been released in various colors, but never in lime green. The 3x3 L-shaped Thin Liftarms haven't been released in lime green since 2001. TIRES These 43.2 x 22 ZR Tires haven't been used in pullback sets before. They do appear in 48 other sets though, so they aren't very rare. WHITE PANELS If you haven't bought Commander Cody or the Mercedes Arocs this looks like the perfect set to get some of the small white panels. PART LIST This set contains 185 parts, shown below. THE BUILD Since it's a small model, I will skip the building steps. I hereby present the finished Police Interceptor. I was on the fence about lime green, but seeing it in real life takes every doubt away. Although not your average police color scheme, the lime green does add a kick to this set. I do love the overall SUV shape of the model. The Driving Ring Connector used in the chassis of the Race Cart (see my review) are used constructing the roof of this model. That relatively new parts proves to be very versatile. Even though there are quite a few stickers, which add some lime green details to the model, the model looks great without stickers too. It doesn't rely as much on the stickers at the Getaway Racer does. The chassis is pretty basic, using the pullback motor in the rear axle. VIDEO Here's a short video showing the model. LEFTOVER PARTS A few common leftover parts. FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS VIDEO Here's a video demonstrating the pull-back functionality. And yes, my girlfriend was kind enough to catch the model before it fell to the ground B-MODEL The alternate model, the Extreme Police Racer, is a combined build with the Getaway Racer, which you can see on the back of the box. Unfortunately the instructions for the combined B-model are not included, so I didn't get a chance to build it. The double rear-wheeled formula one type racer seems to be cool enough to give it a go. SUMMARY I think this is one of the best looking pull-back racers, together with the 42026 Black-Champion-Racer from 2014. The Getaway Racer looks very good too, but it does rely heavily on it's stickers. Lime green adds a kick to this model. Combined with white it provides a great color scheme. The model itself has a very distinctive SUV look, which is properly executed. Negative aspects are hard to find. This is a winner!! SCORE How do I grade the good guy in this year's duo. 9 DESIGN The lime green actually works. Less dependent on stickers than the Getaway Racer. 7 BUILDING EXPERIENCE Nothing out of the ordinary. 7 FEATURES Limited to the pull-back functionality. 7 PLAYABILITY Combined with the Getaway Racer, kids will love it. 8 PARTS Lime green rims are unique to this set. Lots of useful white parts. 8 VALUE FOR MONEY Pullback sets always deliver a certain value. 7,7 GOOD GUYS DON'T ALWAYS FINISH LAST More image can be found on my Flickr page. Thank you for reading.

(She must have been a visionary since Al Gore hadn't yet invented the internet at that time) This PI set has gotten some hate, which is weird because I ~really~ love the look (or rather 'stance') of this nifty little car.

Too open, a bit unfinished, really. Almost as if they tried to fit in a '50s style lowrider trunk but didn't have the circular pieces to really pull off that look.

"Garnæs, Peter Alexander",,http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?s=b53dd22536d68d5d7ee37fcacf287ffb&showtopic=117804&#entry2396401,"REVIEW - 42048 - RACE KART INTRODUCTION If you are old, like me, there's a pretty good chance the 854 Go-Kart (or 948 Go-Kart for the US) was the first Technic set in your collection. I remember my dad had to help me building this set. Actually, I think he did most of the building and I watched in awe. If you are a dad and have a son (or daughter) this might very well be the set to introduce your kid to LEGO Technic. Is it interesting for us AFOLs too? Let's find out. 854/948 GO-KART FROM 1978 Here you can see a picture of the kart I am referring to. One of the first LEGO Technic sets, although it wasn't called Technical LEGO back in the days. Wikipedia: The concept was introduced as the Expert Builder series and originally Technical Sets in 1977,[1] and was renamed Technic in 1984.. Note: All images can be clicked for hi-res versions. SET INFORMATION Number: 42048 Title: Race Kart Theme: Technic Released: 2016 Part Count: 345 Box Weight: 558 gr Box Dimensions: 15,4 cm x 13,8 cm x 5,9 cm Set Price (MSRP): € 26,99 Price per Part: € 0,078 Links: Brickset, Bricklink THE BOX The box shows the Race Kart on the starting grid and in the lower right corner you see the piston moving. There's also an arrow near the lever, going two ways, so there's probably a gear box of some sorts. BACKSIDE The backside shows the alternate model and a reference to the digital building instructions apps. The instructions weren't available in the app when I built the model, so I can't tell whether they are any good. They are probably up to par with the other instructions in the app, which are quite good. CONTENT OF THE BOX The box contains: 2 Instruction Booklets (A- and B-model) 1 Sticker Sheet 5 Bags INSTRUCTION BOOKLET A-MODEL The instruction booklet for the main model. INSTRUCTION BOOKLET B-MODEL Noteworthy is the inclusion of an additional booklet for the B-model. This is common in smaller sets, but I didn't expect it in a set this size. STICKER SHEET One look at the sticker sheets and it's obvious where these stickers need to be applied. The small round sticker is for the tank cap. The purple and orange color scheme is clearly present in the sticker sheet as well. BAGS Five bags containing all the parts for the model. No unbagged parts in this set. HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This section describes the new or highlighted parts. YELLOW 5L AXLE The 5L Axle has never been released in yellow. As far as I can tell, this is the only 1H 2016 set with a yellow 5L axle. RED 4L AXLE The Axle 4L in Red hasn't been released since 2005. It has only been released in 4 sets in red, so it's not a very common part. SILVER 3L TECHNIC LIFTARM The 3L Technic Lifarm has only been released in Silver in the 10242 - MINI Cooper. DARK BLUISH GREY 3x11 TECHNIC PANEL PLATE Also unique to this set is the 3x11 Panel Plate in Dark Bluish Grey. 3x13 CURVED PANEL The 3x13 Curved Panel, which was introduced in Bright Green in last year's 24 Hours Race Car, is being used in Purple. WHEELS AND TIRES The model uses [url=""[url=""http://alpha.brickli...11#T=C&C=11""]37 x 22 ZR Tires[/url] and 30.4mm D. x 20mm Wheels. Both are very common, but I mention them for easy reference. PART LIST The Race Kart consists of 345 parts. Here's the complete part list. THE BUILD The build is pretty straightforward, although the rear side with gearbox can be a bit tricky for the younger builders. The picture below shows the model halfway of the build. You can see the steering mechanism and lever for switching gears. The finished model looks quite good. The purple orange scheme makes the model standout. I like it a lot. Now that TLG introduced Purple panels, I hope that TLG will release more parts in Purple. Purple will also work very well with White. Steering is actually done via the steering wheel, something most car models lack nowadays. Of course the steering is easily accessible which facilitates the steering. The turning radius is quite big, which slightly reduces playability. This is clearly visible in the second video. The rear of the vehicle looks great too. One can criticize that using a big panel lacks ingenuity, but I think the panel is perfect solution. Admittedly, I am a big fan of the 3x13 Curved Panel! Hopefully this panel will be introduced in White in the near future. The next picture shows the chassis of the vehicle. As you can see, the White Driving Ring Connector is used multiple times as a 3L connector, where you normally might use a 180 Degree Axle and Pin Connector Angled #2. This is something you will find in the other new sets as well. To be honest; I can't stop looking at the Kart! I also imagine a Bright Green and White version, using the panel from the 24 Hours Race Car. Actually, I have built the Kart in Bright Green and White. You can see the result and comparison at the end of this review. The front and rear view of the Kart. VIDEO PARTS LEFT FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS This model has the following features: Steering Gearbox STEERING The steering wheel actually steers the Kart, which is a plus. On the other hand, the Kart from 1978 already featured steering like this, so it's not very special. Hand of God (HoG) steering wouldn't make any sense on this model. The Kart does have a pretty big turning radius, which does affect playability. I know the options are limited on a small model, but I would have liked some ingenious way of steering that would result in a smaller turning radius. GEARBOX The Kart has a 2-speed gearbox, and a neutral. The gearbox is operated by the red lever. VIDEO OF FUNCTIONS The video below demonstrates the features of the Kart. B-MODEL Since this set includes instructions for the alternate model, I decided to build it. Apparently this is a Track Car, although that is a broad concept. I can't really tell by the image on the back of the box what kind of Track Car this is supposed to be. There's only one way to find out I still can't pinpoint exactly what kind of Track Car it is, but it is a pretty decent B-model. Unlike the main model, it does have Hand of God steering. And it features an opening bonnet/hood. The steering wheel is for decoration purposes. It doesn't steer the model. For a B-model the design is more than sufficient. The next picture shows the chassis of the car. All things considered, this is a high quality B-model. VIDEO B-MODEL The video below shows a short demonstration of the Track Car. PARTS LEFT This image shows the parts left after building the alternate model. The leftover parts from the A-model are shown on the left. As you can see the B-model uses one red Technic Bush from the extra parts. SUMMARY Besides the rather large turning radius, there are no real downsides to this model. I love the looks and color scheme. It also it contains various unique and rare parts. It even features a working gearbox and working steering wheel. The set comes with printed instructions for the B-model, so it's basically a real 2-in-1 set. For around 25 euros you really can't go wrong with this set. Given the price, this also makes for a perfect gift. A gift for someone else, or gift for yourself?! You decide! I'd say this is definitely a worthy successor of me first Technic set ever!! SCORE How do I grade the good guy in this year's duo. 9 DESIGN Purple and orange work great together in this set. And it does look like a real Kart. 8 BUILDING EXPERIENCE Fun to build. Great introduction to gearboxes and steering. 7 FEATURES Working steering wheel and gear box on a relatively small set. 7 PLAYABILITY Limited turning radius slightly limits playability. 8 PARTS Some new parts and parts in new (rare) colors. 9 VALUE FOR MONEY Totally worth the money. 8,0 THE PERFECT GIFT As a bonus here are some picture of the Kart where the orange and purple color scheme has been changed to bright green and white. Not too bad, not too bad at all. It would probably look even better when the panels at the front could be replaced by bright green as well. My favorite picture of the Green Kart! The green fender works really well. COMPARISON Here you can see a comparison between the Purple/Orange and Green/White kart. I personally like the Purple/Orange better, but it's fun to have options. More image can be found on my Flickr page. Thank you for reading. I hope you enjoyed it."

Thank you so much for doing the white/green kart at the end, the stickers from 42039 even work brilliantly! This has to be my favorite set from this wave, they absolutely nailed the kart look, the chassis with big side and front panels, the details on the engine I also love the B-model, i cant quite pinpoint what kind of track-car it would be, it kind of reminds me of a lamborghini roadster with that big splitter and spoiler. Shame about the HOG steering on it, but not too big of a deal on a B-model (and might be fixable with some extra parts) EDIT: the B-model also has an Ariel Atom / KTM X-bow thing going on, which are more appropriate for a track car then a lambo :P Edited by vectormatic, 01 December 2015 - 09:03 AM."

This had already been one of my favorites of the new Technic sets, but I hadn't realized it included the 3x11 Technic panels in Dark Stone Grey. I had previously thought that those were only in the much larger Fortrex from Nexo Knights. I really want some of those panels to use for decorative Technic columns in Bionicle displays, so their availability set that I was already keen on (and unstickered, at that) is much appreciated. And the fact that the set is comparatively affordable should help drive the Bricklink price down so I can get some more in bulk. The Kart also looks great in Bright Green, and Mario Kart fans could potentially put together some custom stickers to make a Luigi kart in that color!"

Upon seeing the first pictures, excitement about a Drag Racer quickly got replaced with a ""what's this supposed to be"" feeling. Some people still like it, some think it's the most ugly set in the world. Others claim it's what's called a Funny Car and it's supposed to look ugly. I can recommend reading the Wiki article on Funny Cars. This set does contain two of the ""Tumbler Tires"", which does make it interesting for some people. Is it interesting enough to buy two sets to acquire four tires. That will depend on the price and what the set has to offer besides the tires. I'm glad I got a chance to review this set, because the first glimpse didn't make me very enthusiastic. Since I already have four of the tumbler tires, that would not be a reason for me to buy it. The best thing to do is to switch to neutral and start exploring what this set has to offer. Note: All images can be clicked for hi-res versions.

The wheelie functionality has caused quite some confusion and discussion. Is this car able to do a wheelie?! Without any assisting contraptions?! The top right shows a bar behind the car, seemingly to limit the cars vertical movement. BACKSIDE The backside of the box confirms the car's ability to do a wheelie. However, it seems there's a contraption in the bottom of the chassis helping the car lift in the air. That does feel like cheating. The set can be motorised using PF elements. The battery box attached to the end of the car could act as a counter weight, eliminating the need for the contraption in the bottom of the chassis. Looking at the picture on the box, it looks like the battery box alone is not enough. More on that later. The left lower corner of the backside shows the B-model, an actual Dragster, called Supercharged Dragster. Many have claimed the B-model looks better than the A-model. CONTENT OF THE BOX The box contains: 1 Instruction Booklet 1 Sticker Sheet 4 Wheels 5 Bags INSTRUCTION BOOKLET The instruction booklet for the main model. No booklet for the alternate model. STICKER SHEET Looking at this sticker sheet, I wonder why TLG doesn't insert the sticker sheet in the booklet. That would prevent damage and rolling up. TIRES Two special tires, which we will discuss shortly. BAGS A total of five bags containing the rest of the parts. HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This section describes the new and/or interesting parts. BLUE 5x3 BENT PANEL These new Bent Panels seem to be very suited to make fenders/wheel arches and seats. 3L AXLE WITH STOP We started with a 8L Axle with Stop in 2006, followed by the 4L Axle with Stop in 2010. The 4L seems to be around for ages, but it was introduced in 2010, which was surprising to find out. In 2014 TLG released the 5L Axle with Stop and this we get a new 3L Axle with Stop. 7L AXLE IN YELLOW The 7L Axle has never been released in yellow before. This year TLG surprised us with releasing axles in different colors, like yellow, red and orange. This set only contains a yellow 7L Axle, but you can checkout my other reviews to see which other axles have been (re)released. This 7L Axle is also used in the Police Interceptor. 6L AXLE IN RED While the Red 6L Axle isn't new, it's only used in a couple of sets before. BLACK 7L SOFT AXLES For the layman this seems a common part, but the 7L Soft Axle actually has never been released in black before. Combined with the re-release of the 19L Soft Axle in black, this will open up lots of possibilities. For those of you thinking you've read this text before; you are right, the new Display Team Jet contains these new 7L Soft Axles too. BLACK 16L SOFT AXLE At first I thought this was a new 15L Soft Axle, but upon closer inspection, it appeared to be a 16L Flex Axle. It isn't a very common part though, since it only appeared in the 42026 - Black Champion Racer from 2014. 1x9 BENT LINK Not a very rare part, but you don't see the 1x9 BENT LINK every day. MEDIUM AZURE BLUE PANELS AND Since I haven't built any of the sets containing Medium Blue, it took me some time to notice that this is a totally different color. I am not a big fan of Medium Blue, since it looks dull. Medium Azure on the other hand looks fantastic. It's very vibrant. Hopefully TLG will continue using this Blue in the years to come. BLACK PANELS A modest collection of Black panels. TUMBLER TIRES/WHEELS Tires known as Tumber Tires (or Wheels), since they appeared in the 76023 - TheTumbler for the first time. The official (Bricklink) name is Tire 81.6 x 44 R, but that doesn't sound nearly as sexy. When the Tumber was released in 2014 all Technic fans were waiting for an official LEGO Technic set utilizing these wheels. To everyone's surprise, they weren't used in 2015. Luckily they do make their appearance in Technic in 2016. Upon seeing the tires, people immediately suggested a Dragster/Drag Racer, and here it is. Currently the Tires are going for at least 10 euros on Bricklink, so this already contains 20 euros worth of parts. Although I do suspect the prices will go down after the release of this model. The next video shows a short demonstration of how the Tumbler Tires behave. As you can see in the video, they are prone to slipping. But that only happens when you apply a lot of pressure. The average builder won't notice this behavior. PART LIST This set contains 647 parts, which are shown below. THE BUILD Building the Drag Racer is done in roughly two stages, first you build the chassis, then the bodywork. After the body you will add the spoiler to the chassis, but I'd like to think of two stages in the build. CHASSIS Building the chassis isn't too complicated. No difficult gearboxes or complex structures. One thing that's worth mentioning is that the V8 is chain driven. That's pretty cool! The end result looks okay. The great thing about the separation of bodywork and chassis, is that you can use this chassis to build your own Funny Car bodywork. BODYWORK This is where the controversy originates. Admittedly, the bodywork itself (not connected to the chassis) doesn't look too bad. However, it feels rushed and unfinished, especially the front. For me, this would be a perfect preliminary design, which needs some work to finalize the design. We will attach the bodywork to the chassis in a bit. That's when the peculiar front design really shows. The backside of the bodywork isn't too bad. It's simple, but it works. No complaints here. FINISHED MODEL I hereby present to you, the Drag Racer! The image below clearly shows why I have a problem with the front design. The front wheel arch is way too square. And I am not particularly fond of the big exhaust pipe and the square hole in the bodywork to make it fit. I would have preferred an exhaust design more like the Getaway Racer, possibly with double pipes on each side. The main problem seems to be the 11x3 Curved Panel which is very dominant. Looking at the other supplied parts in Medium Azure, I wonder whether using the Small Panels (#21, #22) could lead to a better design. On a more positive note; I really do like Medium Azure! Combined with Black it results in a great color scheme. Looking at the stickers, Purple can be thrown in the mix as well. Using the lever on the other side (see video), opens up (or lifts) the bodywork. This is necessary to turn the knob to lift the chassis for the wheelie (see next picture). So this is the Wheelie mode that generated a lot of discussion. Although this was expected by most members, we secretly hoped there would be a more exotic mechanism for the wheelie. BACKSIDE I don't have any real issue with the backside of the car. It's a collection of connected liftarms, but it fits the model. BOTTOM As you can see there's no differential between the rear wheels. I'll let you figure out how the drivetrain is connected to the V8 FRONT AND BACK Two additional images, one of the front and one of the back of the car. VIDEO The video below shows a short overview of the model. FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS This model has the following features: Steering via Hand of God Lifting the bodywork Switching to wheelie mode Chain driven fake engine VIDEO OF THE CHASSIS FUNCTIONS The video below demonstrates the functions of the chassis. VIDEO OF THE BODYWORK The following video shows the lifting of the bodywork. ADDING POWER FUNCTIONS This page from the instruction booklet shows what you can do by adding Power Functions. The picture below shows the parts needed to add Power Functions to the model. VIDEO SHOWING POWER FUNCTIONS The following video demonstrates how to add Power Functions to the model, and it shows the performance when using Power Functions. I have added an additional PF Receiver to facilitate the demonstration. As you can see in the video, adding Power Functions doesn't transform this model into a Drag Racing monster. Performance with the M-motor isn't what you want it to be. Replacing the M-motor with an L-motor will obviously help, but it definitely won't be enough to make the wheelie by itself. SUMMARY Do you know that feeling that you see a car for the first time and think ""how on earth did that design make it to production?!"" and after a while you get used to it and the feeling somehow turns to appreciation. That's more or less what happened to me when I was writing the review. Don't get me wrong; I am still surprised that TLG failed to do better than this. Of all the models I have reviewed, this is my least favorite when it comest to the design. I am a big fan of panels, but I think the designer could have done a better job designing the front of the car. That being said, I must admit that this set started to grow on me during the build and especially during the write up of the review. It does have something going on. The Medium Azure and Black color scheme looks great and the introduction of Medium Azure in the Technic line is definitely a winner for me. Hopefully there will be more to come, parts that is. It contains two of the Tumbler Tires, which are pretty expensive by itself, starting at 10 euros on Bricklink. Although this set does have some features, I am a bit disappointed that when you use PF, the car can't do a wheelie by itself. It know the reason behind this is physically valid, but it would have made this model a lot cooler than it currently is. If you find this set for a discounted price, it might be worth picking up two copies. The suggested price of 60 Euro does seem a bit steep when you are only interested in the Tumbler Tires. All in all I started to like the Drag Racer more than I imagined before building it. SCORE Okay, so how do I grade this set? 6 DESIGN Front feels unfinished and rushed. 7 BUILDING EXPERIENCE Straightforward build. 7 FEATURES Nice wheelie function, but it does feel like cheating. 7 PLAYABILITY Kids might enjoy the wheelie function. Power Functions don't add much. 7 PARTS Two Tumbler Tires and some new pieces. Not too bad. 7 VALUE FOR MONEY Good value if you are looking for Tumbler Tires. 6,8 NEEDS SOME WORK More image can be found on my Flickr page. Thank you for reading. I hope you enjoyed it."

This set is definitely the ugly duckling of the wave though, the only thing i like (besides the obvious tumbler tires) is the chassis/bodywork seperate style construction, ive been trying to do the same with my 42039, the entire rear body work pulls off by removing a few push-pins On the bright azure, it is a nice color, but adding yet another color to the quickly expanding range is a bit questionable on Lego's part, given all the different shades and colors in use, all on just one or two models lately, properly color coordinating a moc/mod is getting hard."

The short videos help highlight stuff that isn't immediately apparent from viewing the pics and reading the text I'm not quite sold on this one, was half expecting the wheelie function to be connected to the drive shaft, so it would automatically go into (and maybe afterwards settle down from?) a wheelie as it travels along...

The 9396 - Helicopter is one of my favorite models. I own three copies, which says it all. the news about a new helicopter made me very excited. The news about twin rotors made me even more excited. Although I must admit I was hoping for a Chinook style tandem rotor, instead of a double rotor where one is positioned on top of the other. This set does come with a Chinook style B-model, so maybe that will be worth building. One thing I immediately like better than the 9396 is the color scheme. I love the bright orange-white combination. This set seems to have a huge number of panels, which is not to everyone's liking. Let's find out what's going on underneath that smooth surface! Note: All images can be clicked for hi-res versions. SET INFORMATION Number: 42052 Title: Heavy Lift Helicopter Theme: Technic Released: 2016 Part Count: 1042 Box Weight: 1831 gr Box Dimensions: 57,0 cm x 37,3 cm x 8,0 cm Set Price (MSRP): € 119,99 Price per Part: € 0,115 Links: Brickset, Bricklink THE BOX The box is fairly big, which indicates a pretty big model. Unfortunately the box was damaged. Some cracks and dents, but luckily it wasn't ripped apart, like my Mercedes box. I'm not sure if TLG sends out the sets the same way when they sell via S&H, because I would be slightly disappointed to receive my sets like this. Update: I've seen more complaints about wrecked and/or damaged boxes, so there's room for improvement in the shipping department. The front of the box shows the helicopter lifting it's load. The model is 60 cm long and 53 cm wide. It also shows the contra-rotating rotors. As you can see an M-motor and battery box are included, so there are some powered functions. BACK The back of the box shows which functions are powered. We will deal with the functions later. It also shows the Chinook style B-model, which has motorised functions too. Looking at the front of the B-model I am not very tempted to build it. It looks like a flying guinea-pig CONTENT OF THE BOX The box contains: Sealed instruction booklet with stickers 6 Helicopter Blades 1 Sealed M-Motor 1 Battery Box 2 Soft Axles 10 Unnumbered Bags SEALED INSTRUCTIONS WITH STICKERS The stickers are sealed with the instruction booklet, like we are getting used to with bigger sets. I've said it before, but TLG deserves a big thumbs-up for this! The sticker sheet is still in perfect shape! HELICOPTER BLADES This set contains six of the Large Technic Rotor Blades, first released in the 9396 - Helicopter in 2012. PF BATTERY BOX AND M-MOTOR SOFT AXLES Two Soft Axles, or Flex Axles, are delivered unbagged. 19L? Who knows! More on these later BAGS Ten bags containing the rest of the, mostly white, parts. HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This chapter describes new and interesting parts. Not sure if it's a trend, but like the 24 Hours Race Car this set also has an abundance of panels. I've counted 51 of 'em (not counting the engine covers). It does have two new panels, introduced in most of the 1H 2016 sets. As from today this set officially contains the most Technic Panels. One more than the 42025 - Cargo Plane. 42052 - 51 panels 42025 - 50 panels 42039 - 47 panels BLUE 5x3 BENT PANELS These new Bent Panels seem to be very suited to make fenders/wheel arches and seats. AXLE AND PIN HOLE The axle counterpart of the Pin and Pin Hole. YELLOW 5L AXLE From what I can tell at the moment, the yellow 6L Axle is unique to this set. I made a mistake here. It's actually a yellow 5L axle instead of 6L. RED 6L AXLE Like the yellow 6L axle, the red 5L Axle seems to be unique to this set. This will obviously change over the course of time, but for now it's the only set containing them. I made a mistake here. It's actually a red 6L axle instead of 5L. 19L SOFT AXLES Finally, the black 19L Soft Axles! A lot of people will be glad to see these being used again. Only released in the 8450 - The Mission in 1999, this part has become very rare. DRUM TIPPER Of course these are no Cement Mixer Drum Tippers (60018 - Cement Mixer, 7990 - Cement Mixer). These are Helicopter Engine Covers, and quite good looking ones. They seem to be more versatile then you'd imagine, since they already appeared in 4 other sets. GREEN 3x11 PANEL Two green 3x11 Panels, not to be confused with bright green, used in the 42039. This is the same green as the 42008 - Service Truck from 2014. ORANGE PANELS A collection of 13 orange panels. WHITE PANELS A collection of 34 white panels. WHITE 5x11 TAPERED PANEL PLATE Introduced last year in the Fire Plane, this is a relatively new panel. 2x4 PERPENDICULAR BENT PIN CONNECTOR This 2x4 Perpendicular Bent Pin Connector was introduced in 2013 and it's one of those parts flying under the radar. You won't be needing this every day, but who knows when it might come in handy. PART LIST The set consists of 1042, shown below. THE BUILD Upon opening the booklet with building instructions, I noticed the color of the pages has slightly changed. The pages are lighter blue than we're used to. Probably to increase the contrast and make the difference between the darker colors better visible. This new color is used in every booklet of the new sets. The build setup is a bit different than we're used to. Usually you start by building one side, followed by adding things inside and finished by closing up the model. This time you start by building the fuselage, after which you continue with the gear box and rotors. ROTORS The image below shows the mechanism for the contra-rotating rotors. Actually I made a mistake here. I switched the two turntables. Luckily it didn't take me long to find out. At the top you can see an Axle Connector with Axle Hole which is connected to an axle going through the turntables. This axle is only connected to one of the turntables (obviously). The first set of rotors is connected to one of the turntables, while the other is connected to the axle going through the turntable. This is demonstrated in the video below. GEARBOX Here you can see the setup of the gearbox. A basic setup with a single layer of gears (more or less). You can see the 3L Driving Ring on both sides of the model, used to switch between the different functions. CARGO BAY DOORS I found the mechanism to open the bottom cargo bay doors to be very intriguing. Here you can see three stages of moving the H-Frame down. The video below demonstrates the gearbox and the mechanism for the cargo bay doors. This video shows the gearbox mounted on the fuselage, and the contra-rotating rotors. CARGO CONTAINER The cargo container wraps up the build. FINISHED MODEL Leaving the other building steps for you to discover, we skip right to the finished model. There's always a lot of debate about panels and closing a Technic model with them. I personally love a finished look with panels. Looking at the image below, I can only compliment the designer with his accomplishment. The helicopter looks fantastic! The design itself is fantastic and the color scheme is really spot on. This helicopter looks even better than the 9396 - Helicopter, which I will compare later in this review. The Drum Tipper parts used as engine covers is very well done. You would almost think they are designed to be used in this helicopter. SIDE REAR VIEW In this picture you can clearly see the rear cargo bay door/ramp and the landing gear. The tail rudders are operated manually, which is slightly disappointing. The solution in the 42025 - Cargo Plane was much better. The landing gear is pretty clever though. Very simple, but it works like a charm, using nothing more than gravity. SIDE VIEW The side view shows how well the helicopter has been designed. The panels align very well and the model is almost entirely closed. This is a matter of personal preference, but I absolutely love it. BOTTOM VIEW Yup, there it is...the battery box. You can also see the mechanism to operate the tail wing. I find this to be a weak spot of the model. The lever is positioned very close to the wing itself, which feels a bit useless. It would have been great to operate the wing with the orange Bionicle Tooth located near the tail gate. You can clearly see which panels are used for cargo bay doors. Two 3x11 panels are used as bottom cargo bay doors, and a 5x11 is used as the back cargo bay door (ramp). Both are operated by the Power Functions motor (see features and functions). FRONT VIEW REAR VIEW ADDITIONAL IMAGES Here are two additional images from different angles. PARTS LEFT It's interesting too see TLG provided an extra 19L Soft Axle. It appears to be used in the B-model, but it somehow feels like an added bonus, since this part is wanted by a lot of builders. The 6L""]http://alpha.brickli...""color"":11}""]6L Rigid Hose[/url], which is also used in the B-model, is extra too. Since the instruction booklet tells us we are only supposed to get a single 19L Soft Axle, I am not sure whether it's used in the B-model (it looks that way though). FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS This set has the following features: Contra-rotating rotors (Power Functions) Opening bottom cargo bay doors (Power Functions) Opening rear cargo bay door/ramp (Power Functions) Operating the winch Operating tail wing (Manual) Operating tail rudders (Manual) Landing gear Castering nose wheel The following video demonstrated all of the functions/features. I have added an IR receiver and I am using a PF remote to operate the powered functions. As you can see all the functions work very smooth. The powered functions work pretty fast, so there's no waiting for ages before the cargo doors open up. The winch is the slowest of them all, but that makes sense. As you could read in the review, I don't really like the manual tail wind and rudder functions. I know a designer needs to make concessions, but wasn't it possible to operate the tail wing with the orange bionicle tooth. The castering nose wheel does work properly, and so does the landing gear. Both very simple, but they do their job. SUMMARY Like I said at the beginning of my review, I am fan of flying machines. And to be honest, I am an even bigger fan of helicopters than planes or jets. This might influence my judgement. I am also a big fan of white, orange and grey, so that's another plus. And I happen to like models finished with panels. Do you see where this is going?! I absolutely love this model. The 9396 - Helicopter was one of my favorite models, but I like this one even better. The closed design is something I like a lot, as long as the model is packing some functions too. Panels alone don't cut it. Well, this set has some cool features under those panels. The mechanism for the contra-rotating rotors is pretty nifty. So are the bottom cargo bay doors. The things I like the least is are the tail wing and tail rudders. The tail wing is operated manually, but it's a simple lever positioned very closely to the actual wing. And the rudders are operated by simply moving the rudders themselves. As with the Mercedes I am not a big fan of operating a model by using the switch on the battery box. It confuses me, and you can't easily reach it. I understand TLG can't throw in a remote and IR receiver each time they supply a PF motor, but it's probably one of the modifications most AFOLs will immediately apply. That being said, I absolutely recommend getting this fantastic model! SCORE Okay, so how do I grade this set? 9 DESIGN Absolutely magnificent. 8 BUILDING EXPERIENCE Great build with some clever techniques. 8 FEATURES Great functions, but rudder and tail controls need improvement. 8 PLAYABILITY Lots of things to operate, but would work better with a remote control. 9 PARTS Contains lots of new parts and loads of white panels. 9 VALUE FOR MONEY Worth every penny. Will buy another one. 8,5 ABSOLUTE EYECATCHER BONUS COMPARISON I will end this review with a comparison between the ""new"" and ""old"" helicopter. As you can see my 9396 has a yellow and black color scheme, instead of the original yellow and red, but it will give you a clear picture on how these two compare. More pictures can be found on my Flickr page. Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoyed it."

This was supposed to be a preview-review, before the Dec 1 release date for the set, but it got stuck in customs or something and didn't arrive in time. Well, I'd rather do a good, late review than a rushed review, so here it is. Name: Mine Loader Set Number: 42049 Pieces: 476 (I think) Price: $39.99 (I think) Minifigs: 0 Theme: Technic Year of Release: 2016 Links: Bricklink Brickset The Box Another standard Technic box, not that there's anything wrong with that. It is a littler weird that the mine loader is shown OUTSIDE the mine, but whatever. The Back of the Box Again, very standard. It's oddly technical, showing the exact angle of the machine when turning, but that's the sort of nerdy detail that Technic people like. The alternate Mine Cutting Machine model looks interesting and unusual as well. The 1:1 Part The 1:1 part on the top of the box is especially helpful with this set. These mining machines are very oddly proportioned, since they need to fit in mine tunnels, so it's hard to judge the model size based on the wheels or seat like you can an ordinary set. The Contents You get manuals for both models (a single book for the B and two books for the main), a medium size sticker sheet, 4 bags, and 4 loose tires. The Special Parts This set has 4 of the new mudguard panels in yellow, two cylinder halves in red (a new color), some of the new color red and yellow axles, a couple of the new-ish Technic spacers, some of the axle-pin combination pieces, and a couple swords! I'm pretty sure that's ""an antenna"" and a spare. The Start of the B-Model Since I like the main model better, I'm building the alternate first, so that's how I'll write the review. There's ""power"" for something (probably the engine) being taken off the one axle here. Overall, a pretty standard Technic frame beginning with some structural beams, a frame, and using liftarms to support axles out to the sides. More of the Frame The far end of the model has some obvious steering mechanism being formed, as well as a pivoting arm right in the center that's probably the connection from the Hand of God knob. The Steering Yup. Called it. Oddly, there is a different turning radius between right and left right now. I wonder if that'll get fixed... More Mechanisms That's looking more Technic now. Sad to see a u-joint being used just as a fixed straight connection like that, but it is the alternate model... The Engine Block Because all engines should be enclosed in a red cylindrical housing, am I right? The Chassis It's definitely coming together now. And yes, the B-model instructions tell you to put the stickers on. It doesn't matter whether you build the main or alternate first, you'll get the stickers on (almost - there were a couple leftover that didn't get used in the B-model). Almost Done With the rest of the body done and the wheels on, you really get the scale of this machine. That blue seat is tiny compared to the rest of it! And yes, the uneven steering lock got fixed. After putting the wheels on, you add a couple of ""pin with ball"" pieces to the underside to restrict the steering. They didn't do that at first so that you could turn the axles sharper while putting the wheels on, which made it easier to do. The Grinder Keeping in mind the scale of the machine, this thing looks terrifying! The tan gear at the back drives the spinning blade up front. The red bushes near the turntable let you adjust the angle. All Done The arm quickly attaches to the body and it's done. Sadly, that tan gear doesn't connect to anything - it's just a knob so you can spin the blade by hand. Raise Your Hand, If You're Sure... (I think I'm dating myself with that title...) This thing has massive reach. I'm imagining this inside a mine, grinding away the rock overhead. Pretty viciously effective machine! The crank on this side of the model is used to raise and lower the arm. Works well, and the grey spacer makes it nice to use since it spins freely. The Leftovers Not much left for a B-model. Nice usage! Starting the Main Model The main model starts similarly to the alternate, with a frame, some axles, and a drive connection from one axle to something later. Getting Complicated Already We're only a few pieces in and we already have three separate gear trains going on. There's the axle driving the tan beveled gears inside the frame at the bottom. There's more tan gears in the middle, and there's also a black gear sticking up as a knob that turns the grey connector in the center. The Body is Done I skipped ahead quite a bit, but it was a bunch of standard Technic building. You've got a fake engine with fan at the back, driven by one of the rear wheels, a knob sticking up for steering, and an axle coming forward to open and close the claw. The Claw! I like that they used a link system to open and close the claw instead of just gearing it. The axle comes forward from the chassis (it's the red axle) with a couple u-joints for flexibility and drives a worm gear. That rotates a gear below with a 2 stud liftarm on each side. Those arms have pin with towball in them and then a link going from that short liftarm to the claw. It's a small rotation of the liftarm, but makes the claw open widely and works very well. Raising the Claw A few black liftarms join the claw to the body of the loader and allow it to move up and down. It's a simple mechanism there - one yellow beam goes back and connects to a lever that lets you raise and lower the claw. When raised (as shown), the lever locks in place by going just slightly past the centerline. And It's Done Add some wheels, a cab, and some wheel arches and we're done. It's a great looking machine, pretty unique, and looks like the real thing. The main difference from reality is these usually have a scoop for moving loose rock. Since we've had so many scooping vehicles in the past (tracked loaders, the Volvo L350F, excavators, etc) the claw here is a fun change and adds to the playability for kids. Like the real thing, the body stays very low so the cab only has to stick up a little bit for the driver to see all around, because mines are cramped and busy areas. From the Rear This angle is great. I love the use of the new mudguard panels to make a nice curve to the back of the loader. The antenna is a little weird, but perhaps they had a big pile of flat silver fencing swords to use up. The black gear just to the left of the antenna is the claw control. Rotating that gear opens and closes it. The back end is a little lighter than a real machine would be, but Lego wanted to leave the engine exposed so you can see the cylinders moving. The Conclusion So, what's my conclusion on this model? I like it a lot. It's simpler than a big set would be, but it's got lots of design and playability crammed in a mid-sized set. It's a unique vehicle. However, it does have a few flaws. The steering on the main model needs some drag added. As is, you basically have to drive by holding the steering knob since it'll bend if you push it from behind. I don't like the use of pin with pin hole as mounting points for the orange and red trans plates for lights, since they can turn slightly and be at weird angles. The antenna is unnecessary and in the way. But none of these flaws are dealbreakers or even big deals. They're minor. The Ratings Value: 10/10 - Less than 10 cents a piece, lots of useful liftarms and such, nothing too weird or single-use. Design: 9/10 - Looks very realistic for the size of the set, good functionality, not too dependent on stickers Minifigs: n/a - n/a Playability: 9/10 - Controls aren't perfect (loose steering, small knob for claw control) but very functional and cleverly done. Parts: 9/10 - Nice selection, although heavy on the standard yellow and black. Almost zero studded parts. Overall: 9.5/10 - It's a great intro to Technic set - a unique vehicle, good functionality, nice part selection, and decently priced. I like it a lot and plan to keep it around as a finished set."

Let me add few things about this... thing. It all will be complainging of person who works with these type of machines, so if you just want a unusual machine in your collection, ignore my complaining :) I see underground loaders almost every day, and believe me, this model would now work in the underground mine. First of all, its cab should stick out more from the frame. Each loader has cab placed out of the chassis, to provide better view for the driver. In this class of machine it would help a bit, but in low loader ones it is extremely important: This is the view from the cab of a low profile loader (looking at front - and yes, front of the machine is where engine is placed, because at least at KGHM all machines drive engine forward): Another thing about that cab is that seat and steering wheel/joysticks are placed perpendicularly to the machine chassis, to provide same view for driving forward and backwards. So another weak spot of the set. The model lacks of trans clear lights on the engine part, because all machines that work underground have same lamps on front and back. Another thing that comes to my mind is that warning light and antena would not live too long in the mine, becuase it could be torn apart by ramming into tunnels roofs. It does resemble shape of underground machine, but not a loader. Only machine that comes to my mind is something that are used for moving/placing hydraulic support jacks in tunnels. Sorry for poor quality, I didn't find better picture of it: It does have claw, four wheels and articulated chassis, but have much greater range of movement of the arm. Anyway, I'd give it at least 3/5 for overall look. Model itself, as a set, looks unfinished (or cut down on pieces after visit of an accountant...) For me it looks like engine part was built differently, with knobs for steering/claw operating sticking out from back. Claw needs almost seven full turns of the worm gear to close from opened position, and is rather annoing to use it in way it is built in this model. Bracket that holds bevel gears responsible for steering is rather loose, being hold in place by single 3/4 pin. On the other hand, the steering works very well. It seems that lack of differential will be more common in LEGO sets, becuase it is another model that have fake engine driven by single wheel (like in old russian RC cars...). I am OK with that, but it is a pitty that this model has only R2 engine. Thing that I do not like the most in this model is how the claw arm works. First of all, it barelly lifts the claw of the ground, the movement could be much better. And it has major design flaw - universal joints are not placed in line with articulation points, and this is main reason of 5L axle not being suported on both sides under the turntable. While rainsing the arm, it bends a little! I really would like to see this model built differently, with normal bucket and better range of movement. Edited by M_longer, 05 December 2015 - 11:08 PM."

I agree that the set has some limitations, both in construction and realism, but I think they're acceptable given the pricepoint and size. The antenna is definitely ludicrous - I really do suspect they had a surplus of the swords to use up! And yes, the way the steering knob is mounted is loose. I also noticed that the u-joints to the claw are not in the right spot like you mentioned, but didn't include it since it still works fine. That axle coming forward to the claw has a very long unsupported section that does bend a bit when you raise and lower the claw. It works, but is a bit of a cheat that I'm kinda surprised they let through. I just checked and the bucket from 8043 is a couple studs too wide for this set. I'm betting that was seriously considered, but it'd have meant scaling the whole thing up and that would have put it into a higher price point. Or they could have pulled the mold for the 8x14 bucket back out and remade it for this set... I really like the model you built! And that's interesting about the cabs being basically flush with the top but sticking out the side. In image searching as part of my research, I found both that style and ones like this, with the cab sticking up more (like the photo of the Caterpillar one in my review). I wonder if that's a US/European difference, or different types of mining, or what, because both styles definitely exist in the real world."

One thing reaaaaaally bothers me about this set, both models have the engine connected to one wheel, the other wheel on the ""powered"" axle is just left to rotate freely, and that really bothers me, as it did in 42022 (on 42022 even more TBH, since its main feature is being a frigging car). Looking at the pics it isnt even a space issue (as it was in the hot rod, where they ""needed"" to route the steering through), so they just cheaped out and didnt bother fitting a diff in there (or even a live axle link) Im not very interested in this set (not into construction stuff), but i think this is a worrying trend :("

This was supposed to be a preview-review, before the Dec 1 release date for the set, but it got stuck in customs or something and didn't arrive in time. Well, I'd rather do a good, late review than a rushed review, so here it is. Name: Hydroplane Racer Set Number: 42045 Pieces: 180 Price: $19.99 Minifigs: 0 Theme: Technic Year of Release: 2016 Links: Bricklink Brickset The Box Standard Technic box. Action photo, 2-in-1 logo, inset of functions. And the new ""try our app"" logo in the corner. The Box Back More standard stuff with the B-model and a larger app ad. The Contents 3 bags, two manuals (yes, despite all the ads for their instructions app, they included printed manuals for both the main and B models!), a BIG sticker sheet, and two loose black beams. The Interesting Parts There's a lot of panels in this set. Some are new colors (the blue curved panel) and the L-shaped blue panels are a new mold. I see them being used as mudguards on future sets (or maybe even this year; I haven't looked at the other 2016 Technic sets in detail yet). The hose, soft axle 7 long in black is new as well. The normal 7 axle in yellow is a new color too, and I have no idea why it's in this set. Both models use it in invisible places, so there's no reason other than making it easier to grab the right length axle to have it. I assume other sets this year are using it, but I'm not sure. The Manual And the dumbing-down continues. Now they have to show people to compare axle lengths to the 1:1 prints on the page that have always been there. But how does the 1:1 work on the app? Might have to look into that... (for the record... I pulled out my phone and tried to find the app in the Google store. Couldn't find it. So then I went to the Lego website shown on the page and it had a link to it. Turns out it wasn't showing up because it's tablet only, so Google wasn't showing it to me on my phone. I'll try again later with a tablet...) Starting the Build Two Technic standards. A bunch of pieces linked together to make a specific pattern of holes, and an engine block. Some Weirdness This felt very weird to me - making the crankshaft for the engine, they have you build it right to left. I don't know if it's because I'm a lefty or what, but it felt awkward. I need to look in some old manuals and see if it's always been this way... (nope! I randomly looked at 2013's set 42000 Racer, and it builds it left to right.) Assembling the Core Here's the core of the racer, upside down. The engine block, some gears at each end, and a couple boat studs for smooth gliding. And yes, they cheated and those are only attached on two studs instead of all 4. I'm always amazed at how Lego geometry keeps finding interesting ways that it works. Like here, with those boat studs. They fit perfectly into the bottom of the brick and against the beam. The Front End Up front we get a standard blue seat with a couple ""hidden"" wheels behind it. A boat doesn't typically have wheels, but these will drive the mechanisms of this model, so we'll let it slide. An odd part choice here though - in the very front there are two tan ""axle pin without friction"" parts holding that 3 long liftarm on. Why? There's no need in either model for the non-friction pin, and there's lots of the normal blue axle pins in the set. So why include these two different pins? And All Done! It looks like a huge jump here, but it's really not. The front and rear connect to each other, and then a bunch of big panels are added that make the model look WAY bigger. The stickers on this set really make it work. Without them it's pretty bland and boring, so I recommend using them. From the Rear At the back we have a fan to propel the boat. That's not so accurate. All the images I can find of real-life boats use props in the water. But since this is a non-floating model, we have to make some tweaks I guess. There also should be fins going down into the water for stability and hydroplaning, but again, had to drop that. Here's an example of a real boat: You can see they nailed the overall look quite well. The Underside For those that want to see the mechanicals, here's the underside of the model. Minifig Scale Technic? Nope, not quite. A fig will fit the seat, but sticks out of the cockpit and can't fit a helmet at all. So close... Starting the B Model Again with the engine block, but this time an opposing 4 instead of inline. An Odd Part It's rare for Lego to include parts specific to the B-model, so I was curious when I found this 2-axle with pin, a fairly new part. In the main model, it's used in a place that a normal 3 pin would have been fine, and it's the only one of these in the whole set, so it obviously must be needed in the B-model. Sure enough, there's an assembly here that needs it: The Front of the Boat More upside-down building. And that silver piston is basically only there as a spacer. It has no real function. (Yet.... it turns out later an axle goes into it, so it's a support for one end of the axle.) Adding the Wheels We keep building around the engine. This model uses the same wheel setup as the main model. Taking Shape The B-model instructions tell you to put the stickers on in case you haven't - they actually did a good job making the sticker work on either model. But the silver piston used as a cross-brace is a bit weird. It can spin, so that axle hole on the side ends up facing whatever way it wants. The Back End The flex axles are used here under the panels just for appearance and to support the exhausts at the right angle. Same fan propulsion as the main model, and just as wrong here :) Worse, the gearing is switched. In the main model, the pistons and fan spin pretty quickly as you push the boat across the floor. In this one, they turn very slowly. More Instruction Weirdness I'm always curious at how Lego decides to do instructions. Here's how the panels on one side of the boat are assembled. For the mirror image on the other side, they tell you to put all 3 pins into the short panel as step 1 (2 black and a blue), add the white piece as step 2, and then add teh second panel and stickers as step 3. Why two different ways? All Done Here's a similar angle as most of the official images. Looks ok. I noticed though how obvious the wheels are. The back of the box image is a lower angle that hides them more. And I like the mudguard panels as seats. Pretty clever. From the Side I'm not fond of the profile. It doesn't sit level like I think it should. The wheels are a stud too low sticking out of the bottom. The Underside Like most B-models, there are compromises. There's pins and axles sticking out, but that's what you do when faced with a limited piece selection. Minifig Scale Yet? Nope, not quite. A bit too big this time. I think the driver is supposed to sit in the seat with knees over the front of the guard (where the grey pin is). So the minifig is way too small. Spare Pieces Very few leftovers in this B-model. The Conclusion So, what's my conclusion on this model? The B-model is fairly meh, and too similar to the main model. However, I LOVE the hydroplane racer itself. It looks great and is very swooshable. For the price, it's surprisingly large thanks to the big panels on the sides, Yes, this is one set that really needs the stickers to look good, but they look great and are well worth putting on. The Ratings Value: 9/10 - Close to 10 cents a piece, and a fairly large model for the price. Design: 9/10 - Looks great other than the tiny fan on the back. Minifigs: n/a - I was tempted to give a score since a minifig almost fits, but that'd be cheating. Playability: 8/10 - Not much functionality other than the engine and fan spinning, but very swooshable and sturdy enough to be played with. Parts: 9/10 - A bunch of panels (including some new ones), just about every kind of Technic pin, and quite a few thin liftarms . Overall: 9/10 - The set is a solid winner, as long as your satisfied with the main model."

Back in 2000 the Town theme already had several small orange arctic vehicles. In 2014 TLG again released a number of Arctic sets in the City theme (formerly known as Town). Some of these sets are actually pretty big, containing over 700 parts. Looking back in history it seems that Arctic sets may have found their origin in the Technic theme. Although these sets were white instead of orange, they are unmistakenly Arctic. The 1986 Technic Arctic Sets contained the infamous Technic Figures. Unfortunately the 2015 Arctic Truck doesn't contain any Technic Figures, but nonetheless it's great to see a new Arctic vehicle in the Technic line, not counting several snow scooters. Let's see if the new Arctic Truck lives up to the expectations. Note: All images can be clicked for hi-res versions. SET INFORMATION Number: 42038 Title: Arctic Truck Theme: Technic Released: 2015 Part Count: 1219 Box Weight: 2110 gr Box Dimensions: 47,8 cm x 28,0 cm x 7,2 cm Set Price (MSRP): € 79,99 / US$ 84.99 / £ 59.99 Price per Part: € 0,088 / US$ 0.093 / £ 0.066 Links: Brickset, Bricklink THE BOX The box measures 47,8 cm x 28,0 cm x 7,2 cm and weighs around 1385 grams. The box actually feels pretty heavy which means it's filled properly. This seems to be a trend in the Technic theme. Slightly smaller boxes can save shelf space for retailers. THE FRONT The front of the box shows the main model and in the lower right corner there's a image with the dimension of the model. It's 40cm long and 18cm wide. THE BACK The upper part of the back of the box shows the functions of the main model. The lower left section shows the B-model, which looks very promising (more on that later). The lower right section shows the motorization options for the main model. The crane (partially) and the bed can be motorized. Besides motorization some LEDs can be added as headlights. THE SIDE On of the sides shows one of the newer smaller style panels. This is the first time it appears in orange. When you take a look at the sticker you can see that it's not symmetrical. Not sure why TLG ""cut of"" one of the sides of the stickers, since the position of the panel is very suitable for a continuous sticker. CONTENT OF THE BOX The box is pretty densely packed, which is better than semi-filled boxes. It feels like you actually bought something which matches the box size. The box contains: 2 Booklets 1 Sticker Sheet 8 Bags BOOKLETS & STICKER SHEET Unfortunately the instructions and sticker sheet haven't been packed with cardboard protection, which results in a curved sticker sheet and slightly bent instructions. In my case this wasn't so bad. At least no real damage. HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This set proves to be a great parts pack, especially when you might have missed some of the 2014 sets. BLACK LINK TREADS Usually the Link Treads come in Dark Blue Grey, but this sets includes 96 Black treads, which is great if you'd like to replace the DBG ones in your MOCs, or other official sets. UNDERCARRIAGE AND SUSPENSION Several parts are included to build the undercarriage driving the treads. Four Large Tread Sprockets and eight Small Tread Sprockets, which are used as return sprockets. Also included are four Steering Portal Hubs and four Steering Portal Axles for driving and steering the vehicle. Several frames, including two C-shaped Pivot Frames and two Steering Ball Joints to create an undercarriage much like the 4x4 Crawler. The set even includes two H-shaped Frames (a.k.a. Dog Bone Frames). NEW CHANGEOVER CATCH PARTS This year (2015) three new parts have been introduced to improve the changeover catch. More on these parts later. NEW PIN CONNECTOR Another new part for this year (2015) is the ""1L Round Pin Connector"", which looks like a pin connector, but acts more like a bush. NEW PINS Furthermore this sets includes quite a large number of three (relatively) new parts. 17 x Pin with Pin Hole, 14 x 3L Pin with 1L Axle and 11 x 3L Pin with 2L Axle, which have been introduced this year (2015). When the new 3L Pin with 1L Axle was introduced in 2014 it was only a matter of time before the new 3L Pin with 2L Axle would appear. Both new Pins are a great addition to the parts portfolio. PANELS Last but not least this sets contains a fair number of orange panels, including the 3x11 Panel in Orange, which is the first time we've seen this part. PART LIST Below is the entire part list for the 913 parts. As usual this part list can be found at the end of the second booklet. THE BUILD The build immediately starts with some of the new parts, used to build the compact gearbox in the center of the model. Notice the two 20 Tooth Bevel Gears. One would have been enough to drive the 12 Tooth Bevel Gear, so the second seems to be useless. TLG probably used it in the A-model, because they needed it in the B-model, which you can see later. The front and rear suspension are almost identical. The front side also has the 13L Gear Rack, used for steering. The picture below shows the steering rack on the front suspension in more detail. At this point you have more or less finished the chassis. The gearbox is in place and the majority of the functions has internally been connected to the right gears. The small turntable shows where the crane will be attached later on. At the end of the first booklet, some of the bodywork has been attached to the chassis. The orange-black color scheme never fails to please me. Throw in some cool stickers for the extra effect and we have a winner. If you decide to motorize the model, using PF, the top of the cabin can be lifted to accomodate the battery box. The chassis uses lots of orange (and some black) panels to give the model it's distinctive look. The protective black bumber/railing is a nice addition which adds something to the exterior. The dumping bed at the rear can tilt to empty it's load. It's operated by a Mini LA. The Treads, which look very cool in Black, are driven by a Large Tread Sprocket and returned by two Small Tread Sprockets. The front and rear sections are identical. Building the undercarriages feels a bit repetitive, which is a problem for most tracked vehicles. FINISHED MODEL Adding the crane to the model finishes the build. Your model should look something like this. When you take a close look at the finished model, you realize this is something else. It's trully a unique vehicle. The color scheme is brilliant and the fact that it's an Arctic Truck is really neat. It's a welcome change for the Technic line to see a vehicle like this. This picture emphasizes that's it's a very cool vehicle. Imagine this beast plowing through the snow! As far as I know it's not based on a real life vehicle. If's probably a combination of several vehicles and some imagination. I can be totally wrong though. The rear of the vehicle shows the crane and drum, placed on the tipper bed. From this angle you can see some of the internals of the model, the gearbox behind the cabin for example. The crane can be partially motorized (rotation and base), while the boom is operated manually. What I like a lot is the protective railing around the vehicle. LEFT OVER PARTS Some leftover parts, nothing noteworthy. FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS This set has several functions/features: Steering Driving Suspension Crane Tipping bed STEERING As you can see in the image below the steering mechanism has quite a bit of negative caster (please correct me if I'm wrong), which causes the treads to rotate a bit upward/downward instead of only to the left and right. DRIVING You mention driving as a feature?! Yes I do and let me explain why. Normally I would ommit this as a feature and take driving for granted. However, driving this vehicle (on a flat surface) causes it to simply slide over the surface. For other arctic vehicles this would be a plus, but with a tracked vehicle it limits playability. This is one of the main drawbacks of these tread, they simple don't work properly on smooth surfaces. SUSPENSION The suspension is working properly. You do need to apply some pressure, but all things considered it's not too bad. CRANE The crane has four degrees of freedom: Base rotation Lower boom Upper boom Hook It does what it's supposed to do. Base rotation and lower boom can be motorized and switched using the gearbox, while the upper boom and hook are operated manually. TIPPING BED The tipping is operated via a Mini LA. CONCLUSION While the set does offer various functions and features, driving and steering is a serious issue. Therefor this set is more likely to be showcased than to be played with. B-MODEL Instructions for the B-model are of high quality. Looking at the image below, you will see what I mean. Here's the finished B-model, a tracked Jeep with a communcations device. This alternate model looks so good, it could easily have made it as a main model. One thing that does pop in mind; how would this look with tires?! More on that later. When you are in the artcic region it's imperative to have proper communication channels. Since there's no internet backbone, you will need a big antenna of some sort. This B-model actually features a small trailer wagon with a transmitter/receiver. Here's more detailed image of the B-model, without trailer wagon. I would buy this model in a heartbeat if it were a main model. Simply gorgeous. The side view doesn't give away that this in alternate model. The stickers also work really well in this model. And again, nothing to complain here. The model even has a small crane at the rear, operated by the Mini LA. Here you can see the arctic fleet, comprised of both the A-model and B-model. I bet these two can get some work done!! A bit of a messy picture, but this should give you an impression of the size of both models. LEFTOVER PARTS Not too many parts left, which is obviously a good thing. ALTERNATE MODEL WITH TUMBLER TIRES Just like me, you probably have been wondering how this model would look like with (Tumbler) tires. Well, here it is. As I imagined it does look great. Admittedly, these are not the type of tires we ought to use, but to be honest; I don't really care. Again, the negative caster results in quirky steering. The tires are a bit too big, so they hit the chassis when you compress the suspension. While this has absolutely nothing to do with an arctic vehicle, I really love this picture. SUMMARY We're almost at the end of my review, so what do I think of this set. Let's start with getting the Elephant out of the room; this set lacks proper driving and steering. Does that make it a bad set?! Definitely not! It's a great set, but it lacks some playability when it comes to moving the vehicle. The crane and tipper bed do work properly, so there's still some playability left. Does this set look cool? Definitely! I think it's one of the coolest (no pun intended) and most original models of recent years. The orange and black color scheme works great and the stickers are well designed. The B-model is of very high quality and some might even prefer it over the A-model. And if you are not interested in either of these models, this set provides you with a variety of great parts! All in all I think this is a great set! Maybe not to play with, but it scores high on all other criteria. PROS Original model Great color scheme Lots of interesting parts Great B-model CONS Steering and driving don't work too well Repetitive build of undercarriages (minor con) SCORE Below are my scores based on different categories. 8 DESIGN Original and good looking model. 7 BUILDING EXPERIENCE Fun to build, albeit a bit repetitive. 8 FEATURES Packs quite a few features. 7 PLAYABILITY Some features work, some don't. 9 PARTS Comes with interesting parts. 9 VALUE FOR MONEY Two great model in a single set. 8 COOL! As a bonus, here's picture of the main model with Tumbler Tires. Why? Because we can!"

I don't agree with this opinion. Whether it's a special part or innovative building technique, almost every Mini model has something that makes the set worthwhile. This time I will be reviewing the 42001 Mini Off-Roader. This model is not a smaller version of an existing model, so there's no real comparison with a bigger brother, or sister if you will. Nor does the model resemble a real life brand or vehicle, so it is what it is, a Mini Off-Roader. Note: All images can be clicked for hi-res versions. SET INFORMATION Number: 42001 Title: Mini Off-Roader Theme: Technic Released: 2013 Part Count: 100 Box Weight: 165 gr Box Dimensions: 15,5 x 14,0 x 4,2 cm Set Price (MSRP): 9.99 EUR DE / 7.99 GBP / 12.99 USD Price per Part: DE 0.100 EUR / UK 0.080 GBP / USA 0.130 USD Links: Brickset, Bricklink THE BOX The box measures 15,5 x 14,0 x 4,2 cm which is obviously not very big. The weight of the box is approximately 165 grams. FRONTSIDE The front of the box shows a though four wheel drive off-roader challenging a fierce rocky mountain trail...now does it?! What the box actually shows is Mini Off-Roader challenging a small foam rock formation, much like rocks used in Star Trek The Original Series, yet smaller The box also states that this model is for the age of 7 till 14. More importantly, the 2-models in-1 logo is clearly visible, which means this set can be used to build two different models. BACKSIDE The backside shows a picture of the alternate model and a smaller version of the original model. The conversion arrow and the 2-in-1 are printed to clarify that the main model can be converted into a secondary model. SIDES One of the sides shows the 2-in-1 logo and a picture of the main model. Another side shows a picture of one of the wheels in actual size and again, a picture of the main model. CONTENTS OF THE BOX The box contains: 2 Booklets 2 Bags 4 Tires BOOKLETS This set contains two booklets which is not very common for a set this size. Both models share the same chassis, which is why the build has been divided over two booklets, one for the chassis (8 pages with 10 steps) and one for the bodywork (34 pages with 23 steps for the main model and 20 steps for the alternate model). BAGS The box contains only 2 bags which is to be expected from a set consisting of 100 parts. One of the bags is filled with liftarms, panels, rims and two elastic bands. The other bags contains all the other parts, like pins, axles, connectors, etc. Opening the bags results in the following collection of parts, with the exception of the tires. No abundant number parts that will add real value to your collection. Nevertheless, there are some interesting orange parts and elastic bands. TIRES The tires are provided seperately (i.e. not contained in the bags). From the picture you can see that these tires have a front and a back side, so you should pay attention when fitting them to the rims, which have two different sides as well. HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This section describes the unique and/or highlighted parts. VERY SMALL SMOOTH TECHNIC PANEL (#21 AND #22) These two small Technic were new at the time of release and this set was only one of two sets containing them in orange. The other set is the 42007 - Moto Cross Bike. At the moment of writing there's a third set containing these parts, the Black Champion Racer. Side A Side B SMALL RUBBER BAND I was under the impression that these White Rubber Bands weren't that common, but it seems that these bands are as common as dirt. But hey, you can't have enough rubber bands! THIN LIFTARM 1x5 WITH AXLE HOLES Like the panels, these Liftarms were also new at the time of release. Looking at the the frequent usage in other sets, this part has proven to be a most useful mammal. THIN LIFTARM 1x3 Not a very rare piece per se, but if you are not into Bionicle, this liftarm part can be hard to find. Your other option would be to buy the 9390 - Mini Tow Truck, or the 8305 - Dual Bikes from a while ago (2000). LONG PIN WITH CENTER PIN HOLE This relatively new kid on the block is currently used in many Technic and non-Technic sets and has well proven it's worth. AXLE PIN CONNECTOR HUB WITH 2 AXLES Like the previous part this newish part is also quite helpful in certain situations. PART LIST Here's the complete list for all 100 parts. BUILDING EXPERIENCE The build starts with the chassis of the Off-Roader. After connecting some liftarms two elastic bands, one on each side, are attached to the towball pins. This is all there is to the suspension, plain and simple. The two elastic bands contract the L-shaped liftarms, which results in the long ends swiveling downwards. The video below demonstrates the suspension. The simplicity doesn't do it justice, because it works like a charm. The suspension is very smooth with the right amount of stretch and resistance. This great working suspension adds a lot of value to this set. To quote John Hurt in the movie Contact: ""Why build one when you can have two at twice the price?"". I have purchased two sets so we can simultaneously see both models and make a proper comparison. Below you can see two identical chassis which will be used for both versions of the build. At this stage we have arrived at the end of the first booklet, which only took about ten minutes. Not surprising, since the first booklet only has 10 building steps. Progressing to the second booklet, you need to choose between building the main and alternative model. That's a choice I don't need to make for this review, so let's start with the main model. MAIN MODEL When building the bodywork there's a rather peculiar building technique, which you wouldn't expect in an official LEGO set. The Axle and Pin Connector Hub with 2 Axles only protrudes halfway into the Double Bent Liftarm. The Thin 1x4 Liftarm which is added in one of the following steps makes sure the hubs stay perfectly in place, but I was still surprised to see this technique. The finished bodywork for the main model looks like....uhh...well.....I don't know exactly. It doesn't bear any resemblance to a real life model, which makes it hard to judge. One thing's for sure; it's not the best looking Technic Mini Model. The bodywork can be attached to the chassis by using a 7L axle and two bushes, one on each side of the chassis. ALTERNATE MODEL Unfortunately the alternate model doesn't look much better than the main model. It's even a stud less wide, while you would like to see slightly more body, matching the size of the tires and chassis. Attached to the chassis the body is even more out of proportion. It's not really ugly and the color scheme is great (obviously this goes for the main model as well), but the body simply doesn't match the chassis. I can only imagine that this model is supposed to have a chibi look, much like the Microfighter Star Wars models. COMPARISON The following section shows a selection of images from different angles to compare the main and secondary model. The main model has a bit more volume, while the alternate model has a more sporty look. FRONT VIEW The main model has headlights which are attached at a higher point, while the alternate model has headlights which are placed more closely next to each other. REAR VIEW A slightly different setup in both models, where the main model again has higher placed rear lights. SIDE VIEW The side view shows that the panels are used differently in both models. The main models uses them as doors, while the alternate model uses them as engine cover (bonnet). TOP VIEW The top view reveals that the main model might have room for a minifig PARTS LEFT The left image shows the parts which are left after building the main model, while the second image shows the parts left after building the alternate model. As you can see, the main model uses slightly more parts than the alternate model. FEATURES Besides the awesome suspension, which we already have discussed, there aren't a lot of features in this set. There's actually a single feature, which is only present in the main model....opening doors! Wow, impressive! Well, maybe we can't expect too much functionality in such a small model. SUMMARY The Off-Roader is a fun model which is fairly easy to build. The suspension is simple, yet very effective. The model could do better in the design department, but the suspension offers great playability and that is what this set is all about. The orange parts are not very common so they are an added bonus. All things considered this set is definitely worth the few bucks you need to spend on it. PROS Great suspension Fun to play with Some (semi) rare orange parts Great color scheme CONS No resemblence to an actual off-roader Not the best looking model SCORE Below are my scores based on different categories. 6 DESIGN Not the best looking Technic model. 7 BUILDING EXPERIENCE The suspension makes it fun to build. 7 FEATURES The suspension makes up for the lack of functionality. 8 PLAYABILITY The model has Car-Swooshability. 7 PARTS Some interesting orange parts. 8 VALUE FOR MONEY Great present for the younger builders. 7,1 ELASTIC Hope you enjoyed it! Thanks for reading and please rate this set at the top of this topic!"

A set from 1991, with a handsome count of 64 pieces, 3 figures, and a sale price of $8.75! The building(and parrot): We'll start off with the front. It looks like a good solid building to hold those scurvy dogs! We yonder over to the left side: And see a nice open back: And yonder to the plain right side: Back to the left, we find the corner, with a nice area to rest your tired soldiers! We see the platform in the corner, a lovely place for soldiers to stand on! It's a bit...skimpy, so watch your step! The middle is blocked by some stones, assuring security! But still open enough to stand in! The jail is cramped, and fits only TWO people, but we only need one prisoner in this set :-) ! Moving up is the watch tower, a place for your soldier stand and stand watch or for silly parots to sit on! Here's the front middle part, again those stones blocking the way! Figures and Accesories: We have a delightful number of a soldier, a sailor, and a scurvy pirate! A lovely parot! And a generous assortment of weapons! That concludes our review. Overall: It's a fantastic little set, and great for army and supplies and bricks gathering! I can't find any faults with this set, it's just the neatest little thing you've seen in a port *wub* Highly recomended *y* . And to end our review: A comic!"

All my poor outnumbered Soldiers had was a garrison of three men, one Broadside's Brig, and that daft dinghy with the cannon (6245)... plus a lot of tame sharks. 8-| The funny thing is that I recently inherited (okay, begged and pleaded until it was given to me) a friend's old Pirate sets, and he too had tons of Pirates and exactly three Soldiers.

Even back then I was travelling too much to have access to all my lego and I had that little set with me the whole time so kept taking it apart and putting it back together and conjuring all sorts of combinations with just those few pieces. It is probably the set I've spent the most time on of the lot but here are my pros and cons nonetheless: It is a little too much of a toned-down lagoon lockup, there's no palm, no big flag, it's a little on the duller side. Two soldiers to guard one prisoner means that the prisoner should be a little more important, if not a redheard, than atleast his first mate with the tricome and eye patch but not some little foul mouthed swab who isn't worth the gost to his majesty's government for his daily allowance of grule. Let's just hang him and be done with it! Another interesting quality I find with this set is that because of the all stone, concrete looking surface I've long thought of Broadside's Brig as something more like a sheriff's office, i.e... it should be a holding cell on the street inside a settlement rather than a big fort like eldorado which would be on the outskirts of the colony to defend it from attack."

"Hammerbo, Nicolaj Frederik Møller",,http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?s=8cda67990c8cb18d25b59b50374a59d5&showtopic=12051&#entry211403,"Most of you will probably remember PaulC's superb review of Bullet Run (You know, the one where he converted it to minifig scale as well!). You can see that set as a classic LEGO flagship set (like the City airport, fire station or any LEGO space station). These flagship sets do always have some large vehicle (plane, fire truck or mother ship), but there is always another set where you can buy an even larger vehicle. Bullet run has three large trucks, but Night Crusher has the even larger truck. This set cost almost half of what bullet run does (180kr vs. 400kr in Denmark), but with only a single truck, no buildings and 2 smaller vehicles, it seems rather over priced at first glance. The box The box is rather large for a set in this price class. It shows the main idea that the crusher should try to jump over the smaller cars. The content Inside the box you will find a lot of small polybags numbered 1 to 4, a single instructions booklet and a cramped sticker sheet like in all other Racer-sets. The build It takes pretty much no time to build this set. The bags labeled ""1"" gives you the small car, ""2"" gives you the crusher, the truck in ""3"" and finally the trailer and ramps in ""4"". I'm another one of those people who hate STAMPS and I will only put stickers on pieces that aren't ""rare"", so I ended up using only half of them. A funny thing to notice is that every unit with small wheels has a spare tire. With 3 of these you can make a small tire wall for the crusher to jump over as well. Vehicles There isn't much to say about the little yellow car. It is pretty basic and has some decals that make it appear damaged. The crusher cleverly uses a roll cage in the back and is pretty solid. It doesn't work too well with the small ramps. I recommend using the larger ramps from Bullet Run if you want it to jump over the small cars. The rig is a little longer than the ones from Bullet Run with a much more massive trailer. The wheels can be taken off of the crusher and the ramps fit into the small hole beneath the wheel rack of the trailer The flags on the trailer are taken down and the chassis of the crusher can be mounted in the back for transport In comparison with the trucks from Bullet run you can see the trucks are built the same way, but the one from Night Crusher is a lot more substantial. Conclusion The truck is larger and has more functionality than the ones from Bullet Run, but I still think this set is too expensive. The ramps don't work well, but the way the crusher is stored is quite clever. Price: 4/10 Too expensive, but that is when compared to Bullet Run. The price seems more reasonable when compared to other sets in this price range. Build: 9/10 Easy and quick. It would be perfect if not for the stickers. There are both STAMPS and very long stickers that are hard to apply. Playability: 7/10 I got most fun out of loading the truck and playing around with it. The main attraction is to make the crusher jump, but the ramps aren't solid enough for that. Looks: 8/10 I think the small trucks look great. You get plenty of them in Bullet Run, but this truck does also look very good when the crusher is loaded onto the trailer. Final score: 7/10 Great looks, easy to build and a nice addition to the Racers range, but the high price and not too well working ramps pulls the score down.

To be honest I only bought this set because of the two model team wheels... actually, I bought 2 because the sales lady made a mistake and I didn't want to wait. It is a pretty new set being released in 2006. With 360 pieces it does seem like quite a bargain, but the pieces are mostly pretty small and we have seen better in other Creator sets. The box The two main models (that can be built at the same time) on the front and all models with instructions on the back. What's inside 360, 5 polybags, 4 wheels, a sound bick with motorcycle sound and two instruction booklets. The instructions The set has building instructions for 8 models. In addition to these 8 there are a lot of ideas for alternative ""revin riders"" including a snow scooter. It is actually hard to come up with an alternate model that isn't already in the instructions! The instruction booklets start with a page of the content. The second book has ideas right after this index And in the end The models from the first instructions booklet Model 1 (quick build 1) Building time: 6:30 This is a small bike which is built very quickly. It has sound, but I think the wheels are a bit too wide for this model Model 2 (quick build 2) Building time: 10:00 This is a really nice little scooter, one of them you see all the time in the big cities. Model 3 (experienced build 1) Building time: 12:15 This trike has sound that is activated when you mode the exhaust pipes together with the suspension. I really like the look the construction of this model. Model 4 (experienced build 2) Building time: 9:00 This dirt racer is one of the main models and together with the other main model these two use most of the bricks in the set. There is a stick for balancing, but apart from that I don't find much interesting in this model. Model 5 (experienced build 3) Building time: 9:00 Custom bite with sound and a lot of crome details. The models from the second instructions booklet Model 6 (advanced build 1) Building time: 11:33 This is the second main model and it is a lot more substantial than the dirt bike and has the sound brick which activates when you press down (just like the other models). Model 7 (advanced build 2) Building time: 14:00 A motorcycle with a side carriage much like the secondary model of 8281 Technic mini tractor. Model 8 (advanced build 3) Building time: 14:30 This quad bike is my favorite model of the set. It has the sound brick and the steering works as well. The color scheme could have been better, but I don't think I could have done it better with the parts in the set. Conclusion With an MSRP of $20 (for USA. It is a little more than 200kr. in Denmark) it isn't the best bargain for parts, but this set excels in variety of models. You can keep building models for hours by just following the instructions and ideas from the instruction booklets alone! The parts are relatively small, but they are also excellent for MOC'ing. Overall I would give this set a grade of 7/10. I think the set is very underrated. It doesn't look of much, doesn't give you much bang for the buck, but WOW does shine when it comes to building experience! ... and did I mention it has two Model Team wheels?

But hey: who am I? I promiss you, when this set is on sale somewhere I'll buy it! You might be joking, but I once heard a motor bike sounding like a woodpecker, so there really is some trouth to it :-P I agree with you regarding the sound bricks, but it does make a fun challenge to find alternative ways to use them (such as making it the noise of a bird). It is the same with the sound of the NXT which can be quite useful. And thanks Asuka. It feels almost wrong to build an alternate model without using any of the chrome parts or wheels. I wonder if I should use those parts for something else... X-D"

Lo and behold, the new Mars Mission sets! Obviously, I bought them. ;-) The box: Not much to say. Standard box art for MM sets, nothing new. The parts: Some good parts here. Even if you don't like the set (Which I highly doubt after I've had my say :-P ), it's a decent parts pack. I noticed that some old parts have been renewed. I know the wheel has been used in the '07 sets, but the cockpit and hitch I haven't seen in a while. The VLDSS (Very large DSS). Grr. New part. At least, I think it is. Someone slap me if it isn't. *wacko* The figs. I know I've seen that head before, but I have no idea where. Does anyone know? I was hoping that the aliens would have new arms, at least. I was sadly mistaken... On the upside, I finally discovered that they glow in the dark. :-$ The alien has a jetpack. If that's not the silliest thing I've ever seen, I don't know what is. The build. Simple build. A block. So easy a caveman cou- oh, never mind. Geico's used that one enough. Then, we have this jobber right here. Not sure what it is, but it looks like some crystal scanning device. It's starting to look pretty nice. It almost looks practical. The cockpit is suffering from a bad dose of over-stickering. On the upside, we have a new piece there to hold the cockpit on. Part 1 complete. It has a nice little radio antenna, which is ruined by the use of a random missile that looks like it's going to shoot the antenna before it shoots the alien. Still, I never say no to a good missile I can use for something else. The trailer: Fairly simple, but it works. It features stabilizing arms, a handheld saw, and an extremely random mini-bot who's purpose escapes me. The Whole Meal Deal- Erm, general pics. Overall, I thought this was a good set. In fact, it reminds me of this:"

The other sets look pretty neat and fashionable at the surface, but their internal structure is much more hollow and useless with some studless technic beams and such stuff.... very shining, but hard and boring to MOD, just aimed for maximal cool looking box art and the rest went down for saving costs.... (beside that already pretty good 7692 Dropship that is). The only thing I don?t get with that is why the minirobot?s a one-armed one.... ach, Pirates on Mars I suppose.... X-D"

The small exploration robot is cool, but the large windscreen on the main vehicle reminds me about Jack Stone!

Lo and behold, the new Mars Mission sets! Predictably, I bought them. I present to you: the MX-41 Switch Fighter! Man, what a long name. The box: Standard MM. On the front, it shows the Fighter in flight mode, and a yellow note telling you that it transforms. The back shows three pictures showing it happen. The parts: Once I open the box, the first thing that comes out is a bent and rolled up instruction booklet, and I was forced to put it under a stack of beer books for an hour. Then, there's the DSS. Yes, two of the stickers do feature a cobra. I wonder why, because this set's decal should be a beatle. X-D Decent parts, nothing too special. Then, I noticed this little part. It's used for the flick-missiles, but I have no idea what else it would be used for. :-/ The Build: The alien ship: When I looked at the box art for this set, I was releived to see that the aliens don't have another curved-forward wing ship. Instead, they have this little beauty, which appears to be the Alien Mini Cooper- small and hot. *wub* Anyway, partially completed. Even if you don't like the set, it has some nice green flame peices, which work nicely for space laser swords. Fully completed. The only annoying bit about it is that the crystal-holding thing in front wobbles all over the place. The alien fits into it by way of impalement. It must hurt getting in and out. Switch fighter (cockpit): The set makes good use of the Alpha Team cockpit. For controls, it has a meagre handlebar that the astronaught can't even reach. The rear ""shell"" of the fighter starts out around the alien containment chamber. It's a bit odd that the containment chamber has an alien sticker, because the instruction booklet lists it as holding crystals. The crystal canister is held back by a technic pin. This is, without a doubt, the ugliest color arrangment EVER. Warning: Mass stickers. :-X The cockpit fits into grooves in the ""shell"". Then it clicks into place in a 1x1 brick with a horizontal clip. The wing ""mechanism"": The wing. For some reason, the body of the ""mechanism"" has a blue brick. *wacko* The wing and ""mechanism"" connect to prevent the fighter doing a nosedive while in tank mode. The wing ""mechanism"" completed: The underside: The body and wing connect by way of a miscolored red brick. I have no idea why it's red- black would bave been much, much better. Completed. Tank mode: All in all, this looks pretty neat. The wheel base is pretty short, but it's not bad. Transform! The set transforms neatly, if ungainly. Without ""Anti-grav"" support, it would fall forward on it's nose each time it transformed. Jet mode. It's all right, but it could be a bit better. The ""shell"" keeps slipping back forward to the ""tank mode"" because there's nothing to stop it sliding. Spare parts: Overall: I thought this set was great. It could do with some fixing, such as the mismatched colors, but it should be a definate buy for MM fans. Brickshelf Gallery (When available)"

So much so, in fact, that I've been calling it 'Shadow Panther' for weeks, but never mind... Anyway, why do I like it? Well, purple is such a fantastic Lego colour- it's sparingly used, which makes it interesting, and it simply looks great. Those jetpack/backpack things the robots are wearing, and if they are jetpacks, as the back of the box suggests, then the use of chaisaws is quite nifty and innovative. The minibot is cool, and certainly an interesting gimmick. Sure, they don't look quite as good in some of the other sets, but here it looks great. The overall structure and design are cool too. It's always nice to see an 'irregular' mech, and this is no exception. It's especially cool whee the spines are concerned. Plus, on top of all that, it's got a nice selection of parts, including some lovely new ones, and the inlaid box is interesting. Well worth getting, I think."

I really like this set, I wasn't to keen on it when I first saw the pictures bit having seen the review, I am starting to like it. It seems quite sturdy, and it makes a change from the usual 2 legged mechs. As well as that purple is welcome anywhere, I have such a shortage of that colour! I like the rusty orange colour of the robots, and their back/jet packs are quite cool, and the mini robot looks sweet."

Overview: Sabre Island was release in 1990 an it contained 92 pieces and its retail price was $15.50. It comes with 3 Imperial Blue coats, and a nice outpost for them. The pictures + full review: Anyway, you can see here a picture of the box, the model shown on the box differs from the actual model slightly. ...And the back of the box, which shows some nice alternative models from the pieces provided. A close up of two or three of the alternative models. And now for the minifigs. I prefer the Red coats over the Blue coats but these minifigs are nice, and for the number of pieces one gets a fair amount of them. The set itself makes a nice small outpost, it comes complete with a palm tree, a cannon (with ammo) on a turntable, a small tower a nice large Imperial flag and a little red row boat! Here is a shot from ground level showing the cannon and Blue coat (patrolling the out post!) The rowing boat was a nice touch, and it comes with a small flag too. ""No Pirates will avoid the wrath of myself and my mighty Island!"" The top of the tower is rather plain and simple which in some ways is good, as it keeps the whole set detailed yet not crowded, but I feel a little something should of been added to the top though. The back is lacking any type of walls, so one can play with the minifigs inside, yet their are also no stairs or any other ways for the Blue Coats to climb up their tower either! The rag tag pirates attack Sabre Island! But never fear, The Lord Of Pies is here! Me throwing a pie at Captain Ironhook from another angle. Overall I think this is a very good, if somewhat simple set, and makes a great cheap Imperial set! Comments, thoughts and Opinions are welcome!

With the recent twinning of my ""town"" with Dr. Sinister, I needed a gas station that could handle a lot more traffic (especially military traffic and these new 6-wide vehicles X-D ). Here be a thumblink to the original station at BL: I love this station so much, but it really needed some modernization. The reopening of this station received a lot of attention, even the local police stopped right over. One big upgrade to this station is the selling of propane tanks, which is generally a rare commodity from the lego towns i've seen. X-D Also at this service station is a propane tank refilling station. The milkman is our first propane customer. The interior has also had an addition and many upgrades. For instance, this building now has florescent lighting, a big frig in the back, and more shelf space. *y* Oh look! there's the officer purchasing a mountain dew. Now that there's more shelf space, we can sell more than just 1x1 round yellow bricks and levers.

I had to upgrade my hosting package for the Tabletown website last night as it's become so popular I'd exhausted my monthly bandwidth allowance - and so I've put duplicate pix on Flickr which was just as well as the full set of pix has had over 90 viewings in the last few hours! This is of course a scene from the first movie - Raiders of the Lost Ark, but I'll confess it's been some years since I saw it. Here's the box, front and back: The back of the box shows a neat sequence of Indy grabbing the front of the truck and sliding under it and down its length - note the number of grab handles he has to do this! (sorry about the glare, never taken box art pix before) Here's the supply truck: Note the GOLD chest in the back! More of this later... The mudguards and wheelarches are masterfully crafted with little ""wing"" pieces. The entire chassis is built up from plates - aside from the cabin base, there are NO juniorised parts here. Note also the silver 1x1 studs - there are a LOT of these, at the side they look like suspension springs. A view from dead-on front, it looks a little narrow to me here. The canvas hood to the rear is attached with technic pins and held in place by a new piece I personally haven't seen before: And here's the car: Again, it's all plates, no large pieces Mudguards/wheelarches are formed in the same way - no specialised pieces for those here, it's really nicely done IMO. And here's Indy himself on his horse: The complete set: The minifigs! The Afrika Korps torso is excellent and will be mega-useful I'm sure for military builders like myself, but one word of warning - that little patch of skin showing beneath the shirt is peachy-fleshie skin, NOT yellow! Here's that gold crate: In summary, I absolutely adore this set - you get four really cool minifigs, some weapons, a GOLD crate, lots of nice pieces and TWO - count them - TWO military vehicles! And the price isn't too bad either - ?24.99. I will definitely be buying at least one more of these for the troops and vehicles. Like I say, this is my first review, I held off as I thought Vader was doing one and as you can see it's not a building review as I've already built it - but if there's anything I've missed or you want to see more pix of certain items let me know, although I'm off to bed right now. :-) Dr. S."

I found this set next to the Duplo in TRU in Portsmouth (UK) and couldn't resist! Price was ?17.99, which I kinda expected given the size of the box (same as AT-ST). Front of the Box : Back of the Box : Contents of the Box : Look at all them stickers!!! :'-( Minifigures : Quite an interesting build ... quite liked the big statues although getting those stickers in the right place on the wedge was somewhat tricky. I found that the little red ball on the end of one of the pins that keep these statues upright falls of with some ease ... probs just a slightly mis formed piece I guess?! Temple : There's quite a bit of play value in this set ... there's a trough at the top which contains all of the snakes and when Indy gets near the treasure, they can be released, showering everyone with snakes. hehe Before the Madness : You can also knock over the statues, which in turn, knock down the walls, which on one side will reveal a skeleton! All hell breaks loose : Oh ... and here's the star wars link : And here are the spares ... oddly, there are spare stickers!? I searched the instruction booklet several times trying to find where these went, but to no avail! Spares : Noticed a few inconsistencies between the box and the set too, such as different coloured 1x1 round bricks at the top of the temple - box shows dark red, set delivers dark blue. Overall, I'd give this 7 out of 10 ... quite how they managed to get Indy to stay like he is on the box with that whip, I'll never know. It just goes back to being coiled in an instant!!"

Comes in at ?44.99, which, is pretty steep, but, you get quite a bit for your money. Front of the Box : Back of the Box : Back of the Box Closeup : Contents : It was a nice surprise to get numbered bags ... not had a large set with numbered bags for quite a while, at least in none of the sets I've bought recently! Didn't take a close up of the stickers, but I was quite disappointed that the curved pieces had stickers ... if they could print the ATT curved pieces, why not these? Minifigs : Oh ... and there's a nice backprint on the Pilot figure : Now, the build was pretty good ... you build the plane first (after the minifigures). Quite an interesting build in a way, becayse for a while you think the back is the front ... and then you realise, heh! Now ... I've not seen the film in a while, but I don't recall a guy flying a plane with a fishing rod ... don't flame me if this is what happens, see earlier point regards not seeing the film in ages!! :-P After that, you build the temple in stages, starting with the entrance first, and then the holey floor section with the spears. These spears are just loosely placed into technic holed bricks. Quite easy to make em flick out but they can go anywhere! hehe Entrance : Holey Floor & Spears : These two parts are hinged and on an angle to each other and the gap makes for a handy bottomless pit, complete with pole for Indy to swing over with his whip. After that, you create the door and the ratchet mechanism to keep it raised. After that, you add the runners for the ball and the swinging knives trap. Swords Trap - Before : After : Finally, you build the statue that holds the efigy. Nice bit of construction here, especially the way that everything falls over once the efigy is removed. Do be careful when putting the curved bits on though ... it appears one of the edges on mine has slightly bent when putting it on ... nowt noticable though. Temple : Preparing to steal : Run!! You can see that the temple has toppled and debris has fallen all around ... And then, as he goes through the door, the door falls (he gets his hat) and then the rock ball starts a rolling! Ruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun!! The stickers were a pain though ... there's no room for a border around the sticker here! Beware!! After all that is done, you join all the pieces together and it makes more a really good playset. Plenty of opportunity for recreating scenes here! Idol Closeup : Total Set : Spares : Yet more spare stickers??! (sorry, i've already put the spares in my box of bits!) Overall, 8 out of 10 ... lots of play value and a pretty nice build. Too many stickers though ... and defo poor arms for the skeletons! Edited by imperialshadows, 01 June 2008 - 12:18 PM."

Seeing that no-one else has reviewed this set, I thought I might as well do it myself. The set in its entire glory (minus the slammer, instructions and the (obviously) massive sticker sheet) The four cars included in this set; a muscle car, a sports car, a roadster and the police off-roader(!): Because the police obviously have no clue that an off-roader is useless for catching street-racers, no less a batmobile-ish sports car, it will always trail behind: But the police have a trick up their sleeve - the drawbridge: Gotcha! And the mechanism that makes it all tick: The motor is nothing more than a (slow) pull-back motor. Push down the bridge, the latch will hook on to the gear and keep it in place until the latch is released. And there's the new gas station. Staying within theme, this gas-station is, like the tanker in 8147, from the company Fuel 4 Speed: There's a notable presence of detail here, such as the soda-dispenser, water (coolant?) bottles and other accesories, two fuel pumps and bumper-level railings to prevent cars from crashing into them. There's no interior however. And as demonstrated here by a loyal Octan-employee and a pursuing officer, the gas station is built to minifig-scale: My impressions of this set: As a collector of tiny turbos, and yet to miss a set, I got this one regardless of what it included. The gas station is indeed very nice, and the minifig-scale accesories were unexpected. The lack of interior is no big issue, and the both the station and bridge can with ease be implemented into a mini-fig town. The bridge also solidly built, and includes the ramps in its design, so it can be lifted, with ramps attached, without breaking apart. The slammer included in the set is identical, apart from the white color, with those in 8147. The cars are also very nice, altough I am yet to get used to the yellow batmobile, as I've grown accustomed to calling it. I also love the off-roader's chunky tires, they make perfect wheels for the newer minifig-scale cars. I never consider price/parts ratio, and here it would, for me, be irrelevant, because it will never be demolished for parts. The play value is what I would consider pretty good, and while the bridge won't rise with a car on it, it's still strong enough to stay open with a car tipping over the edge. Hmm. Every nerve in my body is saying that this sets is worth roughly 8/10, so: Verdict: 8/10 Edited by WhiteFang, 23 May 2009 - 07:01 PM. Indexed"

Four astronauts and four aliens, with an extra gold visor (yay!) Not bad. The base of the horribly unstable alien craft. The wings move up and down, aswell as back and forth, the purpose I know not. Next we build the nerf section of the base. Basically technic. And the rest of the tube connectors. Heres the farthest I got the little missle to go. Its fairly dissapointing. Good thing I didnt expect much from this portion of the set. Heres the start of the command base. More of the main structure, will be adding lots of things to all the little beams. Heres a storage container and the surprisingly not flimsy radar. On this side we see the alien elevator. It uses a HORRIBLY long technic rod, I have not seen one of this proportion, its like, a foot and a half long. More of the inner base where all the little tubes shall go. All the connected tubes and such. I also encountered a problem. In the instructions it says for the end of the elevator prong to be touching the tube connector where it is shown here, but mine has a 1x space inbetween. No matter. Heres the completed base. + My knee. Again. Onto the spaceship. The bulk of it is just technic supporting beams, with some large slope peices covering it all up. More on that later. The white coverup. The middle section lifts up to store the overly large jetpack. As you see, the storage containers take up most the bulk in the back, and you can see the jetpack on the ground. Aswell as the trigger hand hold thing that allows you to swoosh it. Look, in the back! Lego Greebles! Despite the large cockpit, it only holds one person, laying down. The wings are really the saving grace - double layered with a nice two toned effect. Kitty nudged me this picture so its abit blurry, my apologies :-| Extra peices and or peices I have no idea where the hell they go. :-P Overall, the set is quite fun I must admit. Full price, I probably would not go for it, But I got it for just under 70 dollars. For that price I can confidently say its quite worth it, many useful peices, nice figures (other than the aliens) and the tube things are quite fun to boot, even though I liked the life on mars system more, which I also have. None the less, its very fun to make them shoot around. Alright, so its not much of a command base either, and it looks abit bare. But it's still fun, even if you ignore the nerf section. Overall I give it a hardy 3.5 out of 5, the openness and epic fail of a missile launcher are hard to get by, but overall, its a dandy set :-D Merry Christmas *wub*"

If your asking how they are but together you snap the window piece into the ho\lder. Errr.... no. As Brikbitz said on his site in the 7732 postal plane review... Quote You can see the traditional airplane window piece, but the bad news is they've changed the window pane. It's the new flat piece used in 4996 Beach House, it just doesn't work as well. Without the original bevelled edge it doesn't seal the window and there is small noticable gap around the edge. Not a major problem but it might get a bit draughty inside and certainly no high altitude flying. I was wondering if it is the old or new type.

I paid 149,99 EUR for 1981 pieces. This set is separated in 4 parts. 1: the Service/Gasstation 2: the cars. the petrol pump and the fountain 3: the cinema 4: the town hall The Service Station has a lot of really nice details, like tools for the car repair, or the table with the cashpoint and the foodstation (there?s a croissant, a banana and a apple in this set). One of my favourit parts is the trolley with some tools, you can see it at brickshelf. At the second part are only a few pieces and i needed not much time to built the 2 cars, the fountain and the petrol pump. There?s something at the truck i don?t understand.. maybe i did something wrong.. but.. the truck has no backlights.. *wacko* I like the petrol pump, that?s why i post a pic of it: The cinema is the highlight for me. It has also really nice details, like the popcorn table or the gumball or candy machine. The colours sheme is really nice, the front of the building with the big displays is a cool idea. Overall a really nice building. The town hall has also a really nice colour sheme, i love that dark green mixed with the white stairs. A lot of plants around and in the town hall. As you can see some figs who married there. Not more to say about this building. See the pics and enjoy it: Overall this set is a must have!! It was really fun to built it. This set reminds me of the Back to the Future movie with Michael J. Fox. The whole gallery is at Brickshelf, there you can find a few more pics. I hope you enjoyed this review. Regards Sandra"

Nice to get some different angles on the components. Sorry to disagree with anyone however, but this was not a great review. I appreciate the effort Sandra made but a great review would include more details such as what are stickers and what are printed pieces. A great review points out flaws or limitations as well as what works or is really neat. A great review would have analyzed the price per piece and compared that to other sets/themes. One might look at the recent reviews of the Indy sets or the new Spongebob sets as examples of really good reviews. The pictures are good but a great review, above all, should provide the reader with some new information, perhaps even answer questions posed in the pre-release discussion thread. I learned nothing new about the set from this review. That said, it was a good review for someone who had not seen the pre-release discussion and she did a good job of showing said person what they could expect in the set."

I appreciate the effort Sandra made but a great review would include more details such as what are stickers and what are printed pieces. A great review points out flaws or limitations as well as what works or is really neat. A great review would have analyzed the price per piece and compared that to other sets/themes. One might look at the recent reviews of the Indy sets or the new Spongebob sets as examples of really good reviews. The pictures are good but a great review, above all, should provide the reader with some new information, perhaps even answer questions posed in the pre-release discussion thread. I learned nothing new about the set from this review. That said, it was a good review for someone who had not seen the pre-release discussion and she did a good job of showing said person what they could expect in the set. It?s good that you told me your opinion about my review. It was my third review i made and i have to say that i made this review not for analyses, just only to show the EB Members some nice pics and to tell them my opinion. Lego is fun for me!! I don?t like to analyse the pieces, bricks, prices, colours. I just want to build something. That?s why i?m at Eurobricks and not at an other big legocommunity in Germany. Lego is fun, fun, fun!!

It?s a hard desicion between Coffee Corner and Town Plan, because they are both really great sets. The Market Street is no ""must have"" in my opinion. But the other two. Maybe you should start with the Coffee Corner, it?s the older set. The Town Plan is newer and will be available longer then the Coffee Corner.

Wow, I have not been called a ""youg man"" (by which I assume you mean ""young"") for a while. As a forty year old with three kids that's unusual. *sweet* I tried very hard to remain positive in my critique and complimented her on those things she had done well. I felt that given the somewhat juvenile ""OMG, BEST...REVIEW...EVER"" tone that was creeping in amongst the replys, that it needed to be tempered with some thoughtful suggestions as to how a good review could be made great. Your ad hominem approach is offensive and far more negative than I was and to suggest I should do my own review is ridiculous. I live in Canada and we do not even have the set available here yet thus I am interested in seeing reviews of this set. If I already had the set I would not be so interested. And next time you propose to critique a critique perhaps you should actually read what I wrote. I said she wrote a good review for a specific audience. I did NOT say it was awful or whatever you seem to have assumed I meant. Saying something is good but could be improved can hardly be characterized as ""bitching"". :-|"

I went to my local Wal-mart looking for an exclusive Bionicle set yesterday, but was amazed to find everything there- SW, Bionicle, EF, Indie, the works. I nabbed the JSF and the Rogue Shadow and scampered home to take pics with my new camera. *wub* The box: The same as the other '07 boxes. Nothing new. The back shows the various features, with ""pop out R2."" :-| Luckily, the intruction booklet and the DSS were intact- not folded like the last MM set I got. |-/ The DSS: Not too bad, but printed parts would have been great. The figs. Anakin is amazing, IMO. *wub* Fits the CW Anie great. I noticed on the S@H reviews the kiddies were saying how ugly he looked. |-/ They need to see the CW cartoon. For the sake of my health, I should probably stop reading those. :-D The build. I won't go too in-depth on the build, since *vader* posted a very in-depth review here. The start of the build: The body of the fighter starts out long and skinny. The JSF's landing gear allows it to sit comfortably without getting in the way while swooshing. R2-D2's launching device. R2 in position. When launched... ...He often gets stuck if you don't press the button hard enough. :-/ Looks like R2 needs to lay off... whatever it is robots eat. So far: The flag stickered. It's a big sucker sticker. Completed. I forgot to add the nose stickers before I took the pic. Warning- the nose cone sticker is actually two stickers. I thought it was one, peeled of one of the stickers, and put it on the middle of the two 1x8 plates, and didn't notice the other sticker. *wacko* Various completed shots: I think this was a beautiful little set. R2's launching unit and the flick missiles are annoying, but easily fixed. I plan to add proper cannons in place of the flick missiles. Anakin is a great minifig, but he doesn't look so well standing next to my other figs. The Brickshelf Gallery (when public) Will"

First off, this is a truly lovely set that many people should own, even though it's SOLD OUT on the S@H :'-( . now lets start off with an overview. *Note*: I was missing a few of the pieces (the rabbit, the trike) when I toke the pics. The figs and a cat. The engine: I really love this thing. It's a beautiful 0-6-0 steam engine with a tender. This is probably the most detailed steam engine Lego has given us. I loved it so much, I made a non-holiday version for my town. The flat cars: I like these, but they seem a bit simple. Their cargo is good for Christmas or a birthday party. The passenger car: It resembles the green passenger car we got a while back, but I like the interior in this one a bit better. The caboose: a simple caboose like the one from 2001. the sad thing about it is thats there is no interior and it's hard to take the roof off. Overall: I like this set, but it is kind of hard to use during the non winter months. The price is kind of good, but with that price, it should have came with the motor. I give it a 9/10 Happy New Year! Edited by AgentRick57, 04 January 2008 - 12:00 AM."

As a general statement I have to say its really a neat set that is not that expensive for what it holds. 1) Box art Like always I will start with pics of the box art. BTW, notice anything guys ? No bloody crappy DSS. Yes, finally a set without stickers and that feels great :-D 2) The Mfs Nothing really spectacular there. The only novelty lies within the inclusion of the new Commander (yellow torso) BD. Apart from that, there are 2 BDs and unfortunately yet another SBD (I like those but I have a huge amount of them, and I would rather had something different). You have 3 short blasters and a couple of extra parts. 3) The Spider Droid I think it?s a pretty cool little buggar. It?s a rather simple yet classic construction I think. It has sweet parts such as the BD body in dark bley. It really has a spider feel unlike the previous Ep3 one. 4) The Hailfire Droid This baby represents the ?pi?ce de resistance? of this set. I truly love it !! Sure it?s a bit under scale but I don?t really mind that. Its conception is superb even if I totally dislike assembling those technic treads (especially 80 of those small things). The ellipse of the treads is well balanced and that trans disc is a brilliant idea. The great thing is those new flick fire missiles: they don?t fall unlike the other ones and they do look good on this baby. Also you can put the wheels together and the missiles to gain some shelf space (easy storage ON :-D ) In conclusion those druids re really sweet and are perfect target practice for the upcoming RGS hehe !! I hope you enjoyed that review and do not hesitate to comment and ask pic requests if any ;-) *yoda*"

Then the Commander you are talking about has a tan body with oreange markings only (check !!) and the commander here has a full YELLOW body like in the Spiderman set Doc Oc's hideout (4856) !!

Clearly, this is another army builder with a minimal vehicle as we're becoming accustomed to. Heck, even the diminutive Hailfire is technically a droid as well, thus making this all minifigs, from a certain point of view. Only negative: It is a bit overpriced. I'll have a better feel for that when I get one. Treads/links always drive up a price, so it might just be fair. The spiderdroid is a winner, even with the unusual parts assortment. I like it when LEGO thinks of different ways to use things, I think it promotes the same from us. I'm not sure what I think of the new battledroid commanders, but at least I can make extras easily if I need to, as I bought a bunch of yellow droid bodies off Bricklink once, thinking I might want to make some kind of new droid out of them. They were cheap at the time, now I expect the price to go up just because of this potential use. Between those and the grey ones, it's good to see more becoming available. Hopefully we'll see black and a few other colours produced for some nice customizing possibilities. All in all, a nice little set with a great army building potential, especially on a buy-one-get-one-half-off or better type of sale. Until then, I'll grab one or two and be glad to have them."

I am so happy that Lego went postal on us :-P . Since they are rather small I shall do a mix review of these 2 sweet sweet sets. 1) Mail Van (7731) Like always I?ll start with shots of the box art and bloody DSS. Now here are the extras of that set: I really love the new torso of the postal worker. My huge grip lies on the mail box: that mail logo is a freaking sticker !! For that part I was so expecting a printed part. That is really really bad !! Apart from that the design is pretty cool. The van is quite simple but I think its pretty cute. I love the fact that the rear is a window. 2) Air Mail (7732) Like always I?ll start with shots of the box art and bloody DSS. The extras are OK: another great postal worker. You also have yet another red trolley with a package that is a bloody sticker yet again !! G TLC should have more printed parts !! That plane for me is a classic thing of beauty !! Really is consistent with the fantastic planes of the 80?s. That?s the kind of lanes TLC should produce instead of those huge Playmo planes. Actually I am happy that TLC released that one ? for once its not a bloody airline exclusive promo set !! Here are general pics. I love the engines of the plane: simple yet superb. Also the top hatch opens to insert mail and packages. The front control panel is a printed part !! I love the classic double train windows and here is a poc of the undeneath of the set. In conclusion I truly love these small sets: they are the perfect size (4 wide car yeay !!) and the colour pattern is amazing as well. I hope you enjoyed that review and do not hesitate to comment and ask pic requests if any ;-) *yoda*

I wasn't real fond of the postal truck at first. It's so different than those in the US. But after seeing your close-up images (esp. the back of the tuck), it looks really neat. I also like the mail box a lot. It looks good in red. Too bad for the stickers, but it's still nice. The plane reminds me a lot of the design used in the Jurassic Park set. As you've said, it's similar to 80s designs. I really like the brick-built design too. It's just real Lego - that's about all I can say. Very nice sets that are a must together.

I have already 4032 and those new hinges are looking really terrible when compared f.e. with 6368. Second one is new minifig, I don?t know what I expected, but this torso design looks too simple and too cheap.. Concerning new car - I appreciate fact, that TLC makes after long long years again Postal sets, but I don?t like those new-style cars.

On a side note, did anyone notice the message on the back of both sets' boxes, ""designed for easy building and instant play""?

I thought I'd share a review of it. *sweet* I'd like to say sorry about my photos, they were taken quickly. first, we have the box: it is the smallest lego box I've ever seen, and actually looks cute *wub* it will be heavy competition with playmobil's specials... back of the box, showing an action pose: the contents of the little box, with a very tiny instruction manual *wub* the manual unfolded. Notice that every part has its part number beside it :-) the back of the manual, showing some fire sets and the other Impulse sets the parts, 30 in total: the small set built. the firefighter has a small fire to extinquish, armed with an axe, chainsaw, other saw and foam... psssh thing X-D . five extra parts in a 30 part set! we get an extra black hatchet, yellow bar tap, light bley 1*1 plate, red 1*1 plate modified with fingers and 2*2 dark bley radar dish. Besides the plate, I've never seen these as reserve parts... but I'm not complaining X-D here is a small ""alternate"" model I created with it: a small bbq... what? He's hungry and he needs to put something on the bbq >:-) X-D Overall, you can't go wrong with these Impulse sets. I paid 2.89 euros for this little set, so thats a great value! Sadly the only impulse avaible were these 3 city sets (no police) and the alien Mars mission... Looking forward to the knight and magician as well as those Indy sets! TT"

This one comes fresh of the 2008 line of sets and promises 3 different models. Packing 522 pieces (albeit a lot of 1x1 plates) for only $29.95 it was hard to pass this one by as I was foraging for the new 2008 Star Wars sets at the local Target. Plus, I was itching to do another review since I had finally fully recovered from my marathon UCS Falcon review which took the better part a month to complete. The Box: The box is pretty standard Creator type box which shows off the three models (beach house, Caf? and ?towering? apartment building.) The back of the box shows some of the features of the three models. Interesting features of the three models prominently displayed on the back include: - Food counter complete with coffee (espresso) maker and food warmer (with chicken leg!) - Home office complete with laptop (and the ubiquitous coffee cup.) - Flip up roof granting access inside of beach house. Note the satellite TV dish and even rain gutters along the roofline! Opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals. We?re back to the reusable cereal box type tab system that we saw so often in 2007 sets. Note the parts inventory is on the side of the box as well. This is a nice feature. Once inside the box, we are greeted by eight sealed bags plus two yellow 16x2 plates and a green 32x16 baseplate. Thank goodness there is no DSS (dreaded sticker sheet) but alas there are no minifigs. In addition, there are the three manuals (one for each model) and they were stuffed into my box with the care of kid trying to put 10 gallons (or liters if you prefer) of candy in a 5 gallon bucket. But hey, we?re not collecting manuals here so who cares if the manuals are all bent and warped? The Manuals: The three manuals are 74, 72 and 48 pages in length. They are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings: - Piece call outs for each step - Parts inventory at the end of the primary model build - Page numbers Color separation in these manuals were fine for me. Plus, we get the usual verbose LEGO instructions on not dumping all your pieces outside in the grass and not to dump all your pieces into a single pile. Thanks for the tip, TLG! Parts list The Pieces: Pretty standard stuff here and as I mentioned, lots of 1x1 plates and tiles (at least 100.) However, we do get quite a few windows and a couple of doors. A majority of the color is black and yellow. I did see a few pieces that I was not familiar with so I?m going to show them below. Keep in mind I?m not a parts jockey so bear with me if I think a part is brand new for 2008 and it was actually released with the classic space line. 2x2 Window (fixed) and 4x3 window that opens: The follow photo shows the window glass (same as in Corner Caf?), door glass and new black parts. Turns out these black parts are used as wheels. I showed the window glass because it still contains the molding circle just like they did before. It is hard to see from the photo, but it is there. The door glass I think might be new: I don?t recall seeing these 2x2 round plates with clips before and I thought I would show the mail only because it is printed and not a sticker: I know these are common, but didn?t they have four studs on top? These only have two: How about this sloped 4x3 window that opens: Overall a nice assortment of parts with nothing juniorized. The Build: The build was fun and was fairly straightforward. Once you figure out which of the three models to build, it goes pretty quick. Here are a few shots: See how the inside is made: Look at the detail with the flowers and even the outside water faucet! Outdoor seating area: Upstairs being built: Upstairs with opening roof (notice the satellite TV dish): Check out the patio on the upstairs complete with outdoor light and rain gutters! Here?s my favorite, the BBQ grill. At least we know where those new parts go: Finally, check out the tree. No juniorization here! Here is what is left over: So far, I have only built the primary model. The others look interesting, especially the caf?. The Design: The design was well done. Very rich in detail. I love how there are no juniorized parts. The house is accessible by taking off the top floor (like Caf? Corner and Market Street). There is an internal staircase as well. There is no interior to speak of in the beach house, but there is in the other two models. The only real negative is that it is kind of small when you get it done. It would be nice if it was about 50% bigger. Here are a few views of the beach house with a few minifigs thrown in: Check out the close-up of the caf? which I think looks great: Also, here is a photo of the interior of the apartment building where you can see the office and computer: Overall Thoughts: It is a really nice set. A tad on the small side but it has some great detail and lots of features. Quick enough to build all three models and would fit real nice into an existing town plan. Is minifig scale, but does not come with any. Lots of window parts and black slopes. Is a nice diversion from the onslaught of Clone Wars ships that we can?t remember seeing from the movies. Final Rating: 84% Build 9/10 (Pretty quick and fun.) Functionality 9/10 (It is a Creator set so you have multiple varied builds. Diverse enough to keep the kids entertained.) Design 10/10 (Excellent and well thought out. Outstanding detail for such a small model.) Parts 6/10 (Fair, nothing earth-shattering but lots of slopes and windows.) Price 8/10 (Price ratio is good but you get a lot of little parts. Would be better with minifigs.) Edited by WhiteFang, 23 May 2009 - 06:38 PM. Indexed"

Great review, especially nice to see the closeup parts shots. Those new 2x2 white windows are very much like replacements for the classic 2x2 windows TLG stopped regularly making a while back, so it's great to see them. The wheels are trolley wheels, common in sets including stretchers and handcarts. The holder for them is a fairly recent part I think. I remember a couple coming in a little single minifig jet engine repair set I picked up in a S@H order within the last year.

I'm also very impressed with Takuto20's mods. I've been trying a few of my own. I liked the tower block design, but a lot of stuff needed fixing. Firstly I added a 4th wall, and made it so the storeys could be lifted off like in the other models. I also added flowers on the windowsills and doorways out on to the balconies. Still to be added is an extra door for the top floor which I'm going to get from the new doors and windows pack. I added a chimney that goes all the way up the back of the house, and has a fireplace on every level. Each floor is fully furnished with a fireplace, wash basin and bed on the upper levels... ...and a corner sofa and coffee table, plus an extra large fireplace on the ground floor. Finally here is my idea of what to do with two copies of this set! All the parts pictured are from 2x 4996, except 5 extra fence panels and the minifigs. The house on the left has it's garden at the rear."

BEFORE BUYING Even if I am City fan, those new sized planes are really not mine cup of tea, my love to Lego is firmly frozen somewhere between years 1980-1995. Main reason to buy was, that I wanted to write a review at Czech Afol web Kostky.org. I bought it three days ago via web advertising, price was +- 35 USD. 2. AFTER OPENING THE BOX As presumed, some very big parts and three bags, and as an additional bonus lot of Danish air free of charge. First sight told me, that this will be really short and easy building.. 3. IMPRESSIONS DURING BUILDING ...and it was really true. 30 minutes of lazy building. Bag 1 - plane. Bag 2 - plane gondols with supports. Bag 3 - wings and propellers. When I saw the way, how is this plane made, I was strongly thinking to play Money for Nothing from Dire Straits as a music accordant with whole set. 4. IMPRESSIONS AFTER BUILDING - LOOKOUT Juniorized creeps. This is my first plane in this scale and for 99% the last one. Lack of details, lot of ugly big parts, from whole set you can see the main development target - to keep RRP at some certain low level. Inner space of airplane absolutely undone, no details, no luggage, no computers, nothing at all!! Just a lot, lot of air! The very only details in whole plane are the stickered pilots desk and some kind of seat constuction. 5. IMPRESSIONS AFTER BUILDING - PLAYABILITY But, what is playability at this set? Hydroplane, which cannot float (as seen on enclosed photos) ? If TLC will make some new kind of big parts used for gondolas, to make the plane floating, they will for sure make no other damage. Juniorization couldn?t be higher. You even cannot drive across the carpet with the plane. So, how to play? Open the doors, open the cabin part, and turn with propellers? Weak, Weak, Weak! 6. RESUMED IMPRESSIONS Sadly I must say, that at limited release sets TLC? boat seems to sailing to the worst part of the coast. After quite good 7344, perfect 7899 and 7900, strange, but acceptable 7998, juniorization came back with 7906, followed with this ugly Playmobilized 7732. 7. FINAL WORD In fact, even 15 USD seems to be too much for this kind of set. 35 USD, expected RRP in our country, is really overpriced to hell. Neither set, nor minifig is not interesting. TLC maybe knows about juniorization as well, as nowhere on the box the number of pieces isn?t written. If you my AFOL friends want to spent your bucks, better give half of the price to African orphans. You will save your money, and you will have a good feeling!

Well, actually, the first Redman set review! I'm your host, Redman, and today I adorn my medieval outfit to tell you about the Impulse set simply titled ""The Knight"". This is a great set, with 14 pieces, 2 of which are spare, and a minifig with 2 weapons, 2 helmets, and some shiny armour. All this is packaged in a tiny box, just short of 10 cm? (or 3? inches?), with a neat little instruction manual that folds up to the size of the weapons rack included in the set. As you can see, this set only costs a measly 7 NZD. (Disclaimer: Redman not included.) Here we see the box, clearly showing what the box holds. On the top we see a 1:1 scale picture of a minifig, for those new to Lego, or who have forgotten how big a minifig is I guess. :-/ X-D The instruction manual, showing the nice and easy built, with me for size comparison. :-D (*Sorry about the dark image, I had to lean over the light to get a birds eye pic. ;-)*) Here we see the 2 different soldiers you can make with the set; a knight, and a guard or standard troop or soldier or whatever you want to call him... (Note, each set comes with only 1 minifigure, and additional accessories.) Of course you know I'm in the picture just for the sake of it, I'm not really one of the soldiers. X-D The neat little weapons rack, or rather equipment rack, as it holds not only a weapon but a shield (except the ovoid ones), helmet, and armour. Nice and easy storage, so your equipment won't get dirty lying around on the ground. :-D One of the spare parts is another of those robot hands, so you can stick that in place of the shield and allow the rack to hold 2 weapons. Just thought you'd like to know that. :-$ And here we see the nifty little structure of the thing. It can even support a whole minifig! Note the grey stud on the bottom bar is a spare part, I just find it better used there to hold the armour. :-) Huh? I don't remember this picture... 8-| It appears I drifted off, and these guys don't look too happy I overtook their weapons equipment rack. :-$ I should go... X-D So, in conclusion this is a great set for army building, at a reasonable price, with nice equipment, and it can be picked up as a little extra with your normal shopping. X-D That's all for today folks! *sweet* [/Redman] So, what do you think? Should I continue with these Redman Reviews ? (:-P), or just stop now? X-D Comments and criticism welcome! :-$ ~Peace"

So lets start with the new troll helmet and torso, these are both great. This troll really stands out as a leader when next to the usual trolls in the dwarf mining set: Ok so here's a few shots of the front of the set: Now one thing i really like about this set is the way that lego have placed the back wheels higher than the front. This allows the set to really appear to being pulled: Here we have a shot at the missiles on the wagon, these are better than some around i have to say. If you look just behind the bottom missile you will see a simple firing device, simply push it down and then let it go to see those missiles fire: The troll flag is moved behind the missiles for firing: One thing that does bother me about this set is the lack of anything on the rear, ok it's easy to fix with a little moc'ing so it's not the end of the world but i would of liked something placed there: Now lets move on to the Crownie's wagon, this is simple yet good for holding weapons: As for the Crown knights themselves, well there the ones from the impulse sets which is great IMO: Here's a few quick shots of the 2 larger trolls we have so far, i prefer the sand green one. What about you? Well that's the end for now, requests for pics and comments are welcome. Overall i rate this set as a must for anyone who's a fantasy castle fan, i know i'll be getting more of this set...... As for the new wagon well it's joined up with the other trolls: I do hope the impules crownies i bought today can handle them, oh and yes i did change the knights heads X-D : Fantasy war on!! *vader*"

For this reason, it will be somewhere at the bottom of my list for 2008. Also, I like torso and helmet of the Dwarf Mining orcs much better. The colours make the torso look rather dull and boring, while the other, more brown one, looks much clearer and more exciting. I think I like the *knight* helmet better too, looks more covering and threatening than this one, although I'll save my judgement until I have one in my hands. Thanks again Vader ;-) EDIT: Forgot to mention, hilarious pic in your sig, Vader :-D Edited by TinyPiesRUs, 19 January 2008 - 08:28 AM."

I was immediately pleased with the price/piece which I think is pretty reasonable (343 pieces for $25). Starting with the box, great City artwork boasting ""Special Edition"": Tha backside of the box (no alternate models comes as no surprise): The dreaded decals (I was looking for the skull and bones for radioactive, but no such luck): My favorite part of the set, a very clever forklift: Side view: And the backside: What I like about the forklift is the bars across the top giving the vehicle a ""real-life"" design. The double wheels in the front with two pieces that can hold the wheels also adds to a clever design: I like the figs (although not much new - perhaps I'll make the driver into a werewolf later): The set includes three cargo pallets, the first some sort of fuel with gauge: The 2nd, two Indy containers, and a square 2x4 brick (I have not put the decals on yet): And the mysterious yellow cargo. Your guess is as good as mine :-$ . On to the truck, the front section: The front grill: Another angle: The back: I like the opening mechanism that is very simple, but works well. Also is the large plate tile piece inside. I like this because the entire interior has no studs: And the trailer section of the truck: Orange and yellow tail lights: And the rear trailer open: The complete set: Summary: This is a neat set that reminds me a bit of classic Lego City (but larger). It is very playable and has a lot of accessories adding to the value. The build was very simple, and enjoyable (took me about an hour). It is a great addition to a number of City sets including the Cargo Ship, Container Stacker, the World City Cargo Train, and the new Cargo Plane. As I mentioned previously, I have not yet put on the decals that I'm sure will really add to the overall look of the set. The forklift is awesome and I like the cargo containers. The truck could have benefited from a few additional details (chrome smokers, and an undercarriage box that really opens). Considering everything, I would buy this set again. Hope you enjoy and perhaps this mysterious cargo will make its way into a Brickster Mystery. *y*"

Time will tell on that one. - 30 stickers! It's the Exo-Force of City sets! The truck set does look less plain with them on though. I would reccomend lining them up with the green brick in the second container rather than applying the first lot without a guide or they may end up uneven - It's very hard to put the minifig in the forklift without dismantling (or breaking open) the set slightly - The cargo box attached to the main cabin of the truck doesn't hold very strongly - Minifigs are dull - that dark blue torso with pattern is way overused - green stickers are a different green to the bricks themselves PROS: - lots of nice pieces including the large white panels and cargo pieces, and i like the green/ white colour scheme - the cargo doors open well and the hingeing mechanism doesn't stand out to the detriment of the rest of the set (as some people have complained about the mail airplane) - studless floor in cargo containers makes it easy to move pallets in and out - fits in better than the Heavy Hauler to a minifig sized city - new 1x1x4 slope! (at least I hadn't seen it before) OVERALL - nice set with some good pictures, although a bit flimsy, and way too many stickers - the same issues I have with the Cargo Plane as well (although that had more colour issues)."

I'm your host, Redman, and today I adorn my medieval outfit to tell you about the Impulse set simply titled ""The Knight"". No wait, that's the old script. X-D I mean, ""The Good Wizard"". *sweet* The other Castle Impulse set (the first being 'The Knight'), this is a wonderful, and in my case unexpected addition to the Castle line! I did not expect to get a nice good wizard, but rather another plain white skellie for the Impulse, and was pleasantly surprised when I saw the first picture of this set. The Impulse sets give you pieces you wouldn't expect to see in such small sets, for example, The Knight came with the armour, and this comes with an owl, a gem, and a crystal ball piece. It comes with 11 pieces, including the wand, owl, and gem, and no spares, which doesn't really matter as it doesn't need any. The box sports the set number, age range (which I blissfully ignore X-D), awesome Castle logo, and the assembled set, with the usual 1:1 scale picture of a minifig. The back of the box shows pictures of the boxed Skeleton Tower and King's Castle Siege sets. Note the price is in New Zealand dollars, and is really the same prica as any other Impulse set. Next are the instructions, which are separated into 3 parts, 1 for the minifigure, 1 for the table, and one for the bird stand. Very simple, also worth mentioning is the parts numbers are next to their respective parts, for replacement parts etc. On the back we see (on the top half) pictures of Skeleton Prison Carriage, Skeleton Tower, and King's Castle Siege, this time not of the boxed sets, but the sets themselves. On the lower half we have 8 pictures, each of the different Impulse sets. The Wizard's torso is plain sand blue, with no patterns or anything, but it doesn't really matter is his beard's in the way. ;-) The head is that same old 'white fade to grey beard' head, but the white beard covers up most of the grey. My favourite part is the pants, I love that we're getting printed belts and legs again. His belt has 4 gold crosses (as seen in, if you look closely, the new Crownie's torso and the Crownie archer's torso) and a belt buckle, and the legs have a bottle, a coin, and a small bag. Nice little wizard-ey items. The, er, items, no, accessories, no, models? The stuff in the set include a little stand for the owl, and a table utilising the new 4x4 round piece in light bley, with the crystal ball in the middle, encasing the yellow gem held on by a 2x2 circle piece in blue. Why blue, I'm not sure. Maybe it's because the crystal is yellow, and the Crownie's colours are blue and gold, so the blue piece with the yellow crystal symbolise the Crownie's colours. Or maybe TLC just felt the need to include an odd colour. :-P In conclusion, this is a wonderful set, with some neat accessories, and it doesn't really need to be bought in the masses, after all, you needs an army of owls and wizards? :-| :-P So it works fine as a single set, and adds a more fantasy feel to your Crownie army. That's all for today folks! *sweet* [/Redman] Thanks for reading another of my Redman interviews, any suggestions on how to/what to do to improve it is greatly appreciated, as are all comments and criticisms (except those blatant thoughtless criticisms that don't help at all :-P)! ~Peace Edited by KimT, 10 August 2008 - 01:31 PM."

Batbrick is Back! >:-) Thanks Batbrick! :-D I sometimes flick from the minifig view of things to a person's view of things, but no one seems to notice, so it's okay. X-D And I didn't include pics of the back of the instructions and box because they were included in some one else's Knight review, and there's no change. But I will include them in future, in case someone hasn't seen any of the other reviews of the set I'm reviewing. X-D Expect to see a review of Arachnoid Stalker (or Battle Arachnoid) in the near future! ~Peace"

Here's the complete set in all its glory. Yes, I really like it, but then, Tabletown has the capacity to support it and my green Army have their eyes on it as a potential military transport as well. :-) I'll start out with the little airport ground car thingy - very neat and functional, here are views front and back: Next up, the steps which allow the plane crew to embark and disembark: And to round off this little trio, the cargo loading platform, here in its lowered position. Note the prong thingy sticking out from the rear: And here raised. The prong thingy is now hinged up to support the back of the platform and keep it level: Here's a slightly different angle so you can see the pieces under there: The all-important cargo itself! Hmmm...not much for a plane this size... The cargo pallet slots neatly onto the loading platform: Here's the complete set of ground equipment - all attached: And so onto the plane itself. Note that unlike the other large planes, the main wing sits at the TOP of the row of bricks making up the side of the fuselage: I took it apart a little so you can see the internal construction of the fuselage. Note that the cargo area is really small, right at the back. What else is this thing carrying? Illegal immigrants? :-) A picture of the rear of the fuselage, just because I like the sticker: Front landing gear. WAY better than on the other large planes. I don't know if this is a new piece or what but I've had no problems with it at all, and my kids have been playing with it as well: The rather sexy rear undercarriage - this area reminds me of one of those giant Russian transport planes - wicked: Those angled grey slopes atop each side of the rear undercarriage annoy the heck out of me as they KEEP COMING OFF whenever I pick the plane up. I think a 1x4 plate on top to bind them together might solve that. A slightly blurry view (sorry) from underneath. The gear LOOKS like it might be capable of retracting internally, but alas, no. This is a shame as there's certainly enough room in there and it's a wasted opportunity IMO. Might have to modify that... A view of one of the four engines, I personally think they look too small and should have something under the wing as well to make them rounder: Cockpit: Crew door, open. I LOVE the smooth action of these doors and the way they seal flush against the fuselage when closed: Cargo door, open: Crew door with docked ladder: Cargo door with docked loading platform: Cargo slots inside and locks into place the same way it sits on the loader, neat: The minifigs, sorry this one is a bit blurry: And that concludes this week's ""Show and Tell"".

My own thoughts: CONs: - as noted, the cargo space is really small considering the size of the plane, although I can see this is restricted due to playability - without the barrier in the middle, the cargo would slide all over the place while the plane was being swooshed - the cargo 'lift' (I'm not sure how else to describe it) is very weak and snaps off, although it is a clever design I think it's badly implemented - there is nothing to hold the cargo pallet to the cargo lift truck so it tends to slide off all over the place as soon as the truck moves - colour issues - I had at least 3 shades of green with the larger plane pieces and noticeable variances even with identical cargo hatch pieces. At least one of them also came quite scratched, which was a little disappointing - At $79.95 AUD it's $10 more than the Passenger Plane was with less pieces and figs, and no printed pieces whatsoever! more $ for less, methinks. PROs: - Lots of nice cargo crate pieces and even the stickers for these are pretty good. - landing gear piece adjusts very well to height differentials so the plane doesn't lose its gear as often as the earlier passenger planes - the hinging mechanism works very well to open the cargo holds - opens very smoothly and is not noticeable - I'd definitely like to see more of this technique - the little vehicles work well chained together and are all good small designs OVERALL: - I really like the large planes since 06 but I don't think they've still quite hit the nail on the head. Whereas the earlier planes were a little flimsy, this one is sturdier but has its own issues. The look of the Cargo Plane is nice, and the new landing piece and cargo hatch pieces are really great, but some design weaknesses and colour issues detract from the overall product. It's a shame as with a bit of tweaking this could have been a must-have set."

With a bit of modification you can get the engines to be rounder, or perhaps do away with them completely and replace them with jet engines. *sweet* Though I can't think of a system to retract the undercarriage at the top of my head it seems like there's indeeed more than enough potential to do so. It reminds me rather of an Ilyushin Il-76, one of my favourite cargo planes. :'-)"

I have been thinking long and hard about the scale of the planes in my town. I would like to keep my passenger planes in their classic 4-wide fuselage style, but I really don't mind the new plane hull pieces if they are used as an enormous transport plane like the Ilyushin-76. Unfortunately I can't afford this lovely new green one at the moment (which would be perfect to go with my green army) as I took too much of a hit buying the new 2008 Star Wars sets! But I have modified my white one to take huge cargo loads, in fact my APC is designed specifically to fit inside. Unfortunately I'm a bit busy to take pics at the moment, but hope to put some up soon."

Name: 7621 Lost Tomb Price: $20.00 Parts: 277 Figs: 3 *Box Art First off we have the great Indiana Jones Box art!! I must say the designers did an excellent job on it! I love the little temple design with skulls! As well as including Indy in the right hand corner. The back of the box is just as cool showing all the neat play features of the set as well as an advertisement for the Indiana Jones Game *Figs First off we have our hero, Indian............. What the hell? Why is there a freaking CW Anakin head on Indy!! There was a production slip up as instead of Indy's head I get Anakin's! :-| |-/ I open the box up and there staring me in the face is his ugly face!! TLC is defiantly doing to here a gnarly complaint from me!! >:-( Ok now here we have the "" real"" Indy fig that is supposed to come with the set :-D I just noticed that his fedora hat goes down in the back! Bonus Picture Time, Here is a jacketless Indy with his sleeve torn off, like he looks in the Temple of doom *sweet* The next figure up is our lovely Marion *wub* *wub* *wub* Plus her head is reversible with a scared face X-D Love the new hairpiece in black!! Finally we have our undead skellie with second style head and poseable arms *The Well Of Souls The set itself is a nice model and playset! The Anubis statues are very cool and I love all the hieroglyphs on the walls 8-? Here is the SW link with Artoo and 3P0 X-D The Ark in its resting place The Ark removed, its very cool indeed, but TLC should have made the whole thing in chrome gold |-/ not metallic gold with brown and yellow!! The closeup of the Anubis statue, Yes the Eye is a sticker but at leasts a gold color! *Playability First off you can pull the pin on the Anubis statues which send them falling and taking out the walls. Behind the wall a skellie swings out! There is a lever in the back of the model where you push down and the snakes shower down upon the figs hehe With the snakes all around, Marion is both modeling with the new carrot torch and fending off viscous cobras :-D In the meantime Indy uses his whip to scale the wall and avoid all the snakes which he is afriad of. In the meantime leaving Marion behind to fight them off. :-P The whip is bendable but it will always snap back into a coil, its some type of bendy hard plastic *Scoring Figs- 9/10 Model- 8/10 Playability- 8.5/10 Overall Satisfaction- 4/10 (would be 9/10 if it wasn't for the stupid Anakin head error!) In the end this is a charming set and could easily fit in with the adventurers! It has the cool Anubis statues as well as the Ark. Plus Indy, Marion and a skellie, great selection of figs but Sallah would have been better since he actually removes the ark with Indy However I am still wondering the point of the Anubis statues, this set does seem pretty silly :-P P"

Today us two sworn enemies will be reviewing the Creator Cargo Chopper, here is the front of the box: And while pushing iamded to his doom, here is the back: Haha! Ouch! Oh dear...here are the parts anyway... Here is the instruction of the first model, the Cargo Chopper. I love Creator sets for the different models, they always excite me. Just ignore me finishing off my nemesis in the background. Something very interesting that I liked in the instructions was this step where you must add those three 2x2 yellow rounded pieces under the chopper. This is for support while you build, which is handy, and later you take it off: And even later use it as the cargo. I found that to be rather innovative and clever, as well as - Hey! What are you hitting me for? Both instruction booklets have the same back: Now heres the Chopper itself. I love the design of it, it isn't quite minifig scale but its great all the same. This is my first non-Xpod or House creator set, and it sure is fun. Here me and iamded go for a dizzy ride. I love the nose of the copter, and the landing gear is fantastic. A shot from the other side. Oh dear, it seems we've been a bit sick from that ride, and were vomiting transgreen 1x1s. The cargo itself is nicely made, though I forgot to put on two tiles here :-$ . It fits in real well with the chopper to, and the line is great for giving iamded the wedgie he deserves: This is my first power function set, so I was pretty excited. The motor is intergrated really well into this set, and is activated by pushing that little 3x2 plate with the 1x1 slopes on it forward, until it hits the motor button, that orange knob. Another point of interest is the use of bley barrels on each side. I like this as I don't have those pieces in that colour. A shot of the motor. Its really simple, all you do is pull the hook out to any length that allows, then press the orange button and it will wind it back up. This makes the Chopper pull the cargo up into its bay, and iamded pull me here reluctantly to a whacking: A top view, is that MY head? A view of the chopper without the cargo in it. I love the lowered cockpit: The leftover pieces from building: (NOTE: iamded's head does not count as set piece) And a final shot of the set with me and iamded. Oh, it appear we're dead, oh dear... Hope you enjoyed this review, soon I will post the two alternate models. I loved this chopper, its great to play with and has nice construction. It also has some handy pieces too. The motor function sounds like a gimmick but is well intergrated into this model. Well worth the price, so far this is another win for Creator I say! So far I recommend this model, but later we'll see if the alt models are up to scratch. Also, since this is my first review, comments and criticism welcome on everything.

Overview, the landing gear is very sturdy and nice, and the wings are surprisingly good: Top view, iamded's head fell into the propellers, I was trying to save him, honest! A view of how the motor on this one works, by pushing the orange button you can make the prop spin. It is well integrated like the chopper, though the prop only spins for about 2 1/2 seconds. Still, its a nice feature: The tail is also well made, simple, but lovable. Oh, and check out that tank! The prop spinning, Agh! Is that MY hand? Final view, there seems to be some sort of explosion here 8-| Well I think I got iamded more than me atleast. The second model is also great, though not as good as the chopper. The lack of space to fit something into the cockpit brings it down a bit, but it is a very nice model overall. I recommend it, though unlike the chopper it will be hard to mod into minifig scale.

Top view, Tommy Guns do not actually come with set ;-) Side view, the designers have done an excellent job with the hull, considering the lack of many slopes pieces. You can see it is pretty much minifig scale too: Here you can see that by pushing in the red technic axle, the ""anchor"" on the front will be hauled back into the boat: Back view, these outboard motors are pretty cool, though I wish they could go own into the water more: Overall, though the weakest model, its still a lot of fun, and has a clever way around the lack of a shapely hull. I was impressed with it after the building it, it even has two rounded SNOTTy bottom pieces on the nose of the boat to give the impression it is speeding through the water with the front lifting up. Lots of leftover pieces for this one: The pieces: Sorry about the poor photograph there, it was getting late :-$ Overall the Cargo Chopper is another great set in the fantastic Creator line. Loads of fun, great play, and some clever designs, it challenges you to make your own things, and even includes some nifty pieces (bley barrels! *wub* ) I won't give it a rating, but I'll just say I certainly recommend it to fans of the theme and Lego fans in general. Now, finally, iamded and I teamup in the face of a larger foe. Get that Lord of Pies! Batbrick Away! >:-)"

The set itself is a small but rather sturdy den for the pirates! Review: The minifigs consist of two pirates and one Imperial. The minifigs are not all that rare, which is disappointing, I would of liked a rarer fig! But still it is a good cheap source of pirate and Imperial figures. Here is an overall shot of the set, which includes the three figs, the shanty which is made using palm leaves pieces, and a nice grey shark nibbling at the soldier's oar. A close up of the soldier rowing hard in his boat. I would have preferred to have a normal soldier with shako hat, as I have more officers than normal soldiers now!: And a close up snap of the main structure. Note the wine glass, which was a nice touch! Funnily enough, only 4 pieces of treasure were included in this set, compared to the usual 8 gold coins in other sets. A view from the back, which also gives a good view of the pieces used to construct the shanty mainly simple black 1 by 1 bricks: The Shanty looks good from most angles but their are a few where the roof construction looks rather odd, but that is just a minor nitpick! Yet another view from the front,, this time at a slightly different angle. The yellow base plate looks rather nice too, I prefer it over the tan pieces we trend to get nowadays: ""Attack!!"" The Stupid drunk pirate in the background does not even notice! Overall I think this is a rather good set, despite some shortcomings, such as the lack of treasure and odd roof from some angles. The shark, Imperial soldier and useful parts make up for it, and of course the price is cheap on most auction sites, I got mine for a mere ?5 ($10), with the cheapest price on Bricklink being $8. Rate the set then leave your comments, thoughts and opinions!!!"

It was the first and (unfortunately) the largest Pirate set I owned as a kid, but I played the wazoo out of it. Some of the minifigs have lost almost all their face printing after so many play sessions! Theres just something about the hut that appealed to me more than the cheesy skull-face islands we keep getting.Probably that it wa kind of neutral, good for my pirates, settlers or islanders. Though the palm leaves were rather fragile and used to break off the studded parts. It would be nice to get more of these ""beach village army builder"" sets.

I picked these up the other day, but it's taken me this long to get round to posting the reviews. So, here we go: Tub comparison with a minfig (thanks Brainbox): The lighting changes a bit throughout the photographs, as it was going dark outside, so I only really had my desk light, and I kept getting in the way. 4837 Mini Trains Now the box I really like. It's no different to those of last year's sets, but the colour here is simply fantastic, and really seems appropriate for the theme. So this is what you get inside. All the pieces are still inside the bag, the optical illusion was accidental :-D . No pieces of particular outstanding interest, but the dark green cheese slopes are rather nice. Look out for those later. 1 2 3 This is the main model, and uses all the pieces in the set (bar these two, which according to the inventory are spares, but as with all my other Creator sets, I'm cheating and leaving them in). This is far and away the best model of the three, and evokes the iconic version of a steam train. The green looks superb, but I'm not sure whether that's due to the model itself or the actual colour. Moving on, we get to the second model: 1 Leftovers (yes, I admit, I was using a piece of paper) This isn't actually a bad model. I don't think it's quite as nice as the previous one, but it's not bad. It's different from the first model as well, which is good. Too muich of the same can be a bad thing. Finally, we come to the third model: Leftovers Now... I'll be honest. I don't really know what this is. It's not that good a model compared to the other two. That's all I can say, really. And of course, all the pieces fit into the tub. Overall: I have to say, I do like this set, despite the weak third model. The strength of the primary and secondary models make up for any weaknesses in the third, and I can imagine the pieces being fully usuable in building other trains. While the basic idea of these tubs isn't quite as good as the X-Pods with regards portability and general 'niceness' they aren't bad. And for a fairly cheap price (?3-4) as well. 4838 Mini Vehicles This is one of those set boxes that you see because of the ridiculously loud colours. Sound marketing scheme if you ask me. I've managed it again. There are pieces outside the bag. Or are there? Now these I like *y* . 1 2 (I don't know what the clip is for, there isn't one on the other side) 3 4 5 This is the main model of the set, and again all the pieces are used bar these three, the spares. It's quite a nice model, although the car's a bit odd. Still, I like the ramps, and the colour scheme reminds me just a little of G1 Ultra Magnus. Hmm, I think that boom arm could do with refixing... 1 2 Leftovers This is actually quite nice as well. It's that classic breakdown truck, and the boom arm itself is quite nice, with quite a bit of movement. Another solid model. 1 Leftovers I'm surprised by the amount of detail here actually. Not only have TLC included a spare wheel at the back, but also what looks like a trailer hitch, which all adds to the 'realism.' Another nice model to round out a nice set. And in the tub. Overall: I'm not sure which of the two I like better. When I bought them, and on the way home, I much preferred the train set. But after building this set, I'm not sure. This is another good set from the year when TLC seems to be giving us so many. There are some good pieces in here too, and while there's nothing unique, they're still good. So, thanks for reading, hope it helped someone, and if there are any requests, I'll see what I can do. That's requests for pics, not songs ;-) . Edited by WhiteFang, 23 May 2009 - 06:56 PM. Indexed"

So i don't really know how to do it right, but i'll try the best. (Sorry if some pictures are a litte bit dark, but i'm not really into photography and i got bad light here) Let's Start with the Dwarf's Mine Defender: Theme: Castle 2008 Set Name: Dwarf's Mine Defender Number: 7040 Pieces: 86 Price: ?9,99 (EUR) First, as always, the box: The back, a few instructions on how the defender works, for those how don't know ;-) : And the instructions: We continue with the minifigs, sorry i forgot to make a closeup of the dwarf: And finally the mine defender itself, i personally think it isn't as bad as maybe some people think. The chain for the catapult is great i think: I kinda love those controls, the mechanism with the rubbe rband actually works pretty well, but only on a not-glossy underground. That's pretty much all of it, it's small but i like it a lot. So let's go on to the tower raid now, which would be my absolute favorite of those new sets. -------------------------------------- Theme: Castle 2008 Set Name: Tower Raid Number: 7037 Pieces: 364 Price: ?29,99 (EUR) Again, first the box & Instructions: We got 2 sets of instructios here, one for the tower and one for the siege tower: The Minifigs, we got one archer and one soldier here, both with the torsos of the 2007 sets: Now thw orc side, starting with the great leader, with the new armor and the golden helmet (i love those pieces!): Closeup of the armor & helmet: Then we got another orc-knight: And the prisoner, with handcuffs! The Crownie Tower looks great overall, though there is something i don't really like about it, but later on that. Now the back, and that is what really bothers me, there areno walls on the first floor except the one with the wall-piece and the door, and theprison also is open at the back. The orc easily could jump out there: Not sure what these are all about, they really don't add much to the set: Enough rant now, let's go on with a pretty sweet detail, the golden crystal on the little table: The wall piece on the first floor you can ram in: And finally the very best thing of this set, the amazing orc siege tower! From the front: The great working ram, you can pull it back very far and it got pretty much power: Here we got another sweet detail, the siege ""platform"" that moves out by pulling a cord in the back of the tower: Finally a picture of a bit siege action: If you ram in the lower wallpiece, the brown shelfs of the prison-floor collapse and the prisoned orc is finally free! Summary: Likes: As i mentioned before, i really think that's the best ever produced siege tower, it's got so mich details and works extremely well, also the overall look of it is magnificant. The destroy-mechanism of the tower is pretty cool too, the brown door is a fine detail too. Nothing much to say about the mine defender, i like this little set, and there's nothing really to bother about it. Dislikes: The Back of the tower. That's really the only thing that's a bit bad imo, they could have put there 2 more walls on the first floor and something to lock the prison easily. Final Thought: The Tower Raid for me personally is the best of the 2008 sets so far, it's got great playability and looks simply good. My opinion: Buy it!"

Thanks for showing all the mechanisms of the tower, I didn't notice them from either the pics we had or the instructions--it didn't hit me that when you knock down the wall the second floor breaks. That is a genius idea. This looks like a superb set, unfortunately my priority right now is the Troll Warship. Still, if that really is U.S. $80, I might skip it and go for this instead, which is only $20 US. One note, though. I think there might not be a back cage on the second floor of the tower so that the mechanism can work. Did you try to see if the second floor ground still falls if you add it a fourth cage wall? Also, you could just pretend that the tower is built against a mountainside. It would fit perfectly and add more defense to the Knights. Great review! :-) VK"

The rubber system is not effective at all. I bought 2 defenders recently and i found out that when the wheels move, the rubber just stuck there without rotating the blades at the front :-/ I have not really found a solution for mine yet. So far, i only took out the rubber band, placing the blades on the ground, removing of the red technic part on the left side. In this way, when the defender is moving on smooth ground, the blades will move too ;-)"

Almost exactly one year after Caf? Corner was released we get the third installment in the increasingly popular LEGO exclusive town series. Combined with the famous 10182 Caf? Corner and its trusty companion 10190 Market Street this trio makes the foundation for an amazing city block of LEGO goodness. For those new to this series of sets, check out my reviews of the two previous sets in this line: Cafe Corner Market Street I would not necessarily recommend reading too many of my reviews in one setting as you might experience loss of brain cells and/or drowsiness. You have been warned. So, how does Green Grocer stack up to the two previous sets you ask? Well, follow along kind reader and I shall attempt to unravel this question. The Box: The gigantic box is pretty standard and looks amazingly similar to the Caf? Corner box. The back of the box shows some of the features of the green grocer as well as a lot of the cool interior that was absent from the previous sets. In addition, we are shown an image of the three sets together and a small insert image showing how they connect together (as if we could not master that difficult maneuver?) Opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals. As it seems to be the norm now, we have the reusable cereal box type tab system that we saw so often in 2007 sets. However, upon opening the tabs we are pleasantly surprised to find a cardboard tray! Have not seen one of those in a while. As you can see in the photo, we have two 32x16 green base plates, three instruction manuals and a bunch of bags that are broken into four groups: Group 1 has 12 bags and goes with the first manual and builds the first floor. Group 2 has 9 bags and goes with the second manual to build the second floor. Group 3 has 14 bags and goes with the third manual for the top floor and roof. And one bag that is not numbered and hence you can open it whenever you feel like it. There are no stickers ? Yay! Moving right along, we get to the three instruction manuals. The Manuals: The three manuals are 55, 47 and 47 pages in length. They are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings: - Piece call outs for each step - Parts inventory at the end of the second manual - Page numbers Color separation in these manuals was fine for me except dark bley and black. We get a nice photo of all three sets together: Plus, we get a nice tip showing how to split up the bags and what goes where. Those additional pieces you see in the photo just below the numbered bags are the pieces that come from the single un-numbered bag (along with the base plates). Parts list Random manual shot The Pieces: Upon opening the first set of bags, one thing is clear; there are a TON of little tiny pieces! The minifigs are included in this first section as well. Interesting to note that there are a handful of printed pieces and as I mentioned previously, no stickers. We also get a host of new and exciting pieces to add to our collection. Keep in mind my scope of LEGO sets is generally centered around Star Wars, Technic, Creator and the occasional racer set so what is new to me might have been around 15 years. At any rate, here are some of the more interesting pieces: Again, note the printed tiles. This time around, LEGO has decided to include 33% more minifigs than the Caf? Corner and Market Street sets. Yes, we get four minifigs instead of three! Here are the cast of characters: Pictured (left to right) is Sir Top Hat, Miss Jenny Blue Overalls, Patti O? Furniture and little Timmy Cub Scout. I?ll leave it up to the minifig aficionados to decipher which torsos are new and to tell us all about the hairpieces. I can say with reasonable certainty that the four yellow smiley heads are not new (somebody check that?) Don?t forget the lovable little cat named ?Tom?. He is the arch-rival of the mouse ?Jerry? that lives downstairs: Overall, there are a lot of pieces, large variety and wide range of colors. The Build: If you have either of the two previous sets, you will feel right at home here. Just like in the previous builds, it seems like the first ten build steps are consumed with laying a bunch of 1x1, 1x2 and 2x2 tiles everywhere. Almost feels like 30% of the pieces are used up right away (see below). There are several sections where you build various parts of the interior. Take a look at the cash register/counter below: And the beverage cooler: And the produce stand and everything that goes in it: Looks like someone has mail: Looks like someone just had a baby: This set is incredibly well done and gives inspiration to go back and add similar items to Caf? Corner and Market Street. As before, the average builder is introduced to some new building techniques like using the hinge plates to make the angles on the front of the building as shown below: Also the top of the roof shows some interesting ideas: Overall, it is a really fun build that kept me entertained the whole way. The Design: This is a great set with lots of little details. I especially like the little mouse hole in the wall leading to the Jerry the mouse?s area. They even included a little slice of cheese! It seems the designers can?t get away from the ?usual? staircase which I always feel is way too big. Maybe future designs can incorporate a spiral staircase to save room for other things in the model. One welcome addition is the fire escape as seen below: I?m going to show a bunch of examples of various items in the set so you can get the feel of the amazing detail in this design. Take a look at the lamps (torches?) just outside the door: And the streetlight with fire hydrant: Brickwork and archway: Awning: Here is the back side of the building. Note the trashcans and yard tools: Here is a close-up of the railings on the second story balcony and the second photo is the finished product with curtains in the window. Nice use of cups to make the banister on the second floor: Here is the fireplace on the second floor: Second floor staircase with Tom?s hiding spot: Check out the radiator on the third floor: More third floor: Nice grandfather clock and rug (third floor) Check out the deck that is up on the roof. Complete with two chairs, table, umbrella, flower pots and grill: Interesting use of minifig hammers on the roof: Finally, here is what is left over when we?re done: A couple of shots of the front: A shot of the back: And here are all three together: Overall Thoughts: This is an incredible set and the best of the three in my opinion. It is hard to top Caf? Corner but I believe Green Grocer just did. I absolutely love all the details and building techniques that went into making this set. There is a ton of different parts and wide color selection. As usual, we get a bunch of tiles and small plates, but that goes with the series. Also, we get four minifigs and lots of minifig accessories. I?m giving this set a score of 100%! I thought about it and I really don?t know how they could have made it any better. In short, RUN don?t walk to go pick this set up! Final Rating: 100% Build 10/10 (Excellent - Lots of nice interiors, details and accessories to build.) Functionality 10/10 (Outstanding. Raises the bar with interior and detail. Think Caf? Corner on steroids.) Design 10/10 (Excellent ? can?t say enough good things about it.) Parts 10/10 (Great selection and diverse colors. Great minifigs.) Price 10/10 (Price ratio is excellent but lots and lots of little parts. Well worth the price.) As alway, feel free to comment, complain and question what you see here. I'd like to hear your feedback on this amazing set."

I ordered my two copies (one to build, one to store in the ""vault"") last week. Can't wait to get this one! The attention to detail here is what makes the set great. There's nothing to criticize about this set. It's really the closest thing to perfection that I have seen from TLC. The difference between this set and CC is the interior detail, and because of that, GG now become (in my opinion) the best set EVER released by TLC. Do the CC/GG/MS sets fit well with the 50th anniv. town plan? My impression is that out of the box, at least, they don't. Which is too bad. However, I don't think it would be hard to mod the Town Plan so it looks like it belongs in the same town as CC/GG/MS. These sets, to me, are what I have always wanted from TLC as an adult. I hope they keep up the line, and add more elements to this excellent lineup."

TLC originally used a different material for the tubes and this stuff degrades the nozzles (on pistons, switches and so on) over time. The old tubes also grip the nozzles much more firmly and if you aren't careful when removing them, it's actually possible to rip off the nozzles completely. X-O I had this happen a few years ago, although TLC replaced my broken pistons for free. I got rid of that stuff for good after that, although the pistons on my Power Crane still have slightly discolored nozzles. Edited by CP5670, 10 March 2008 - 04:57 AM."

It was use in so few sets (I believe 8851 contained one as well?) and I still don't know why it's better than any other axle. The purpose of the threaded axle is to carry tension. Regular axles are used primarily for carrying torsion (for gears), sometimes for compression (8855 landing gear, helicopter skids), and sometimes just for looks (roll cages, canopies). But used in tension, connectors will usually just pop off. With the threads and the corresponding nuts, this part can be used to squeeze parts together (like the pen in the plotter of 8094), or to hold heavy assemblies onto turntables (like 8862 and 8851). With the power crane (8854) reviewed here, that is the complete list of sets which used this part. I wrote about it here: http://www.ericalbre...1984.html#Parts Eric"

I also sort out the pieces the same way if I'm rebuilding a model. *y* This set packs a lot of functionality into a fairly small size, but was rather expensive for its size ($70) when it was still available, compared to other sets of that time. You can also rig up the Technic flag sticker that it comes with to the main model. I've done that on mine. You may want to reinforce it with tape if you're going to leave the model on display though, as it will break up over time due to UV exposure like many stickers do. I had to do that with mine after it started to crack, although it still looks pretty good."

I got it when it first came out and still love it: the suspension, steering and robust look of the model haven't been done that well ever since. This set puzzled me though, back in the days. The rear suspending part containing the differential and some gears was shown different on the box from the instructions. In the instructions it showed that the (grey part of the suspension) in the back had to be made using a 1x2 smooth tile and 4 cornerplates (2x2) in grey. The box however showed a much sturdier solution using a 1x8 tile and a 1x8 plate. It is also visible on the cover of the instructions.

I am actually making a review with pictures! Yes, I got a new camera for christmas. Now I was testing to see how the camera would reflect, so some of the pics are a bit blurry. I have based this review from Dunamis's reviews. He is my inspiration.So, without further ado, I bring you the Review! Set #: 7693 Name: ETX Alien Strike Price: $19.99, ?12,99 Pieces: 246 Box: Okay, so as you can see below, the Box is pretty simple. As always, European versions won't have the Piece count, name, etc, just the Number I believe. Mine, having the American Version, has the info on it. as you can see, it has the Classic MM logo, and the red Planet, as well as the set in a pose itself. Very Nice. I linked it because the Pic wasn't resizing. http://www.brickshel...ke/dscn0017.jpg Below is the back of the box. It shows the other sets and some features of this set. Contents: Next we have the Contents. This set includes a medium sized DSS (xwingyoda), a bag labeled one, and HUGE bag labeled two, the 1 bag contains a smaller bag, and the two bag includes two smaller bags. 5 bags in all. Also pictured are the instructions. I have linked it due to the non-resize. http://www.brickshel...ke/dscn0019.jpg Figs: Included in this set are three figs. Two jellies, and 1 astro. The jeelies are fine, but I pefer the LoM ones. But they glow. Those new alien commanders for Summer look promising though. The astro is nice, and includes an extra gold Visor. MOC ON! Astro Miner: In all MM sets there is a human and alien set. The Astro par of this set is a Mini-miner. Here is a pic of construction and that wonderful space logo sticker. Not Much of a cockpit. :-/ Finished Miner(The set number, too): Overall I like the miner, and It is nicely designed. I feel the cockpit is lacking though. Aliens: The alien Vehical is the Main part of the set. This pic shows the beginning steps. Solid and sturdy. But those four axles/pin parts(blue) are pointless. No support, and they don't get used at all. Nice TLC. :-| Now we get cooking! This pic shows the tail added on and the more bulk being built. We get a little repetitive and build the craft up in this pic. And this pic from the instructions shows how the alien craft transforms for battle. The completed set and extra bits. Parts: 8/10 Figs 8/10 Price Per Piece ration: 9/10 Playability: 9/10 Overall: 85% The alien craft is great. The attack feature is nice and there are a ton of trans green parts. The alien falls out of the cockpit when turned upside down. I love this set, and it's perfect for MM fans or beginners.It has nice parts, and read the above part for more details. Gallery when Moderated. Keep an eye out for future reviews! Please comment. :-)"

No folds, no wear marks - simply: *wub* ""Was lesen coole Kids?"" - ""KLICK! Das super Magazin fuer coole Kids!"" (How obvious...) #4: building: No differential.

A real quick build. #5: spare parts: ...for the alternate model. The yellow Technic Handle should be from 8412.

Please comment if you want to! A great set review, as always. Nice try making a review of a set that was not red. It almost worked! Maybe next time. *sweet* One thing I noticed is that a bunch of your pictures are missing the beam that goes over the left hand wheel as a fender. Like this picture: What kind of camera do you use? The pictures have very good depth of field, meaning that both the foreground and the background are in good focus. This is usually hard to do without a very small aperture. Yes, ""reminiscing"" is a word. It means to fondly remember the past. I also noticed that the engine was sticky. Set 8408 has the same problem. It took me forever to figure out what the problem was. If you take the engine out of the model, it turns nice and smooth. Then when you put it back in, it works terrible. It turns out the key is that, in the back, there is an 8 tooth spur gear and a 24 tooth crown gear used as a spur. If you look at Technica, you will see that there are two different crown gears. One of them works well mated with an 8 tooth on parallel axles, and the other one doesn't. The difference is only supposed to be longer teeth, so it really should not matter, but it does. If your set works bad, try switching the crown gear to one of the other variety. Worked for me. Eric"

Recently I got a bag of Lego Technic parts where there have been mixed three sets: 8858, 8829 and 8235 The resurrection of 8858 has been described by me in a separate post. Going back to the Dune Buggy – when I saw it for the first time back in 1994 I did not like it, as I was always big fan of 8840 (which I consider to the day the best looking Buggy) and set 8829 looked to me ugly. So there were those all parts in the bag… then I though why not build it ? And I started to do it. When I finished I was very surprised how the final look of this set is! Really taking my words back. Unfortunately in the bag there were missing some parts and I could not rebuild the back spoiler. So I made some changes to it and make it from spare parts that I have and it came out acceptable. I also added some additional parts such as “fake” steering wheel, “Rally” logo, antennas. I have also reverse mounting of the rear tires – why Lego did them like that I never know – as I think they look better this way. Set: well the review has been already made by owner of this post so I will only add few things into it. Engine – V2 (aired cooled?) is driven by 4 gears -> from the single wheel (no differential as in 8840) using two old school z14 tooth bevel , then by z24 tooth crown and z8 tooth type 1. Actually the (as in most old sets) the pistons are moving very fast (not as in current sets) and smooths – I needed to extra clean all engine parts as there was a lot friction. Suspension – set has “engine bay” working using two old gray shock absorbers 6,5l – the movement is not big but works very nice, better then in 8840 in my opinion. Steering – this is a bit odd as there is no direct connection to HoG as in most old sets, but first the gear rack is moved by z8 then two z14 tooth where reverse movement is taking place. Later connection of two old school z14 tooth bevel goes to HoG Details – this is the most that I like in this set, specially how the use of axle pin connector perpendicular and 1x10 bricks with 3x3 cut corners and plate 1x5 toothed ends 2 studs with center axle hole are making the body shape – is just wonder. Tires – the balloon rear are pretty nice the front is a new version of those that were in 8840. What I do not like: 1. Missing of Technic Figure (8840 had it.) 2. no steering wheel in the original set 3. no differential – but having in mind that Lego has introduce 24-12 teeth would be difficult to build the transmission in such small space where the engine is. I will shortly upload new pictures and post them here later on . Over all – I think it is worth buying it as it is very payable ! Actually very payable and runs smoothly , the steering, suspension – perfect Thank you and regards"

Side view with added detail. Underside with newly added axles. Demonstrating how the new hubcaps are put on. Now on to building Snake Oilers Orange-ilicious racer: Back part of the car. The cockpit of the car. They are connected using the S-shaped piece. Front part of the car with seemingly random color choices. *wacko* The front and cockpit are also connected using the new S-shaped piece. Adding Orange-irific fenders. Side view of the car so far. Adding more detail. Smoothing things over. Ground level view with Lime Green ""eyes"" and white ""fangs"". Side view with more detail. Rearword view of the car with newly added cuve-acious windshield. No hubcaps!?! :-| Now onto finished views of both cars, First the Mach 5: Side view with sweet hubcaps. Up close and personal with the Mach 5. A rearend shot. ""I got hubcaps, I got hubcaps!"", Speed racer. Now SO's Snake Racer, yes thats what I'm calling it. :-P :-D Beautiful! Blurry, :-$ rearend pic. ""Watchout it bites!"", Snake Oiler He's ready to take on SR, Hubcaps or no hubcaps! >:-) Racin'! Now for some comparison shots: Hope you all like V.2 better then V.1, I know I liked it better. X-D Seriously though I even learned a thing or two doin' this last version. ;-) Now it's time for my summary: Overall a very well designed and executed set. It's only downfalls are that there are way too many stickers, 32 to be exact, :-| and there are no cool contraptions on the cars to take out the other racer. A great buy for $19.99, I reccomend this set to everybody because of the reasons I staed above and because even I, who is not a big fan of Speed Racer, X-O was drawn to this spectacular little set. Price: 10/10 Pieces: 8/10 Too many stickers. Minifigs: 9/10 Needed some accessories. Playability: 8/10 Needs some cool contraptions on the cars to take out the other racer. Overall: 35/40 General Tarful Edited by imperialshadows, 01 June 2008 - 12:07 PM."

My 8862 arrived today, survived the washing machine coaster and actually was real fun to build! #1: information: This set contains 664 parts (only! I thought I’d be far more!) and was released in 1989 in the TECHNIC theme. Be sure to visit Technopediaif you want to know more! #2: building instructions: Wow these instructions are used! I'm not used to this after all this sets with unread instruction booklets... The pneumatics page: The last step for the alternate model: #3: the parts: Wow! Look at all those technic beams, gears, pins...! (A few parts are missing in this photo!) #3: building: The left worm gear is for the outriggers, the right one for turning the “rear boom” The three 12L Axles: left one: outriggers, middle one: steering, right one: erm… rear-boom-rotation. The two worm gears in the front part: left one: lifting the bucket, right one: dumping the bucket. The turning-mechanism for the “rear-boom” is finished. Once again a toothed 10L axle. The Boat Weight 2x6x2 is hidden underneath the radiator grill. Okay… many hoses and a nice, comfy seat have been added. Now you can recognize the Backhoes real shape. Only with a little violence it’s possible to lift the bonnet (?) through the Pneumatic Pump. Yeah, outriggers. Same technique that the 8854 uses. The finished “boom / jib / scoop thing” (=BJST) :-| X-D The finished loader bucket. And to end the building process: the same picture from the introduction. (OFF-TOPIC: “It is all part of the miracle of nature! - The circle of life!” #4: functionality: This time, I tried something new! I hope you can spot something - if not: Technopedia! Okay, here we go. #5: random shots: I’ve got way too many pictures this time, so I refer to my brickshelf folder. Until it’s moderated you can follow the multilingual links! eins deux three quattro fem zes sédem osiem #6: final thoughts: Definitely worth buying! As a child I thought it looks hideous - but today I’ve found out it’s totally fun to build and freaking functional. Three things I want to mention though: The BJST can only be slewed (a new word!) if the outriggers are deployed. It is also possible that the BJST will reach the ground (danger of grinding or sticking) even if the outriggers are deployed. The two mechanisms for the loader bucket can actually interlock, and the 14 tooth gears might break / disentangle from the axle. thanks for viewing the pictures, I hope you enjoyed it! Please comment if you want to!"

I think that was the only set with 8 distinct functions for a very long time and was only displaced by the 8455 Backhoe in that respect. The turntable on the back doesn't turn very well though, as the weight is all distributed on one side. The screw axle prevents it from popping off but there is still a lot of friction in it. I don't have mine built anymore but it might be worth trying to put a weight brick or something on it. Quote Do you have 8455 as well? I'd love to see how they compare side by side... It looks bigger than 8455 but I don't own any of the big old chuncky tires so I find it so hard to tell. Yeah, it's quite a bit bigger.

I was thinking of getting one of those off BL several years ago, back when the price used to be more like $15 or so, but I realized that I hardly ever use the couple that I already have. :-P They came out with the modern turntable the year after this set, which mostly negated the need for these screw axles. I think their only use now is to hold non-Lego objects onto models, like the Technic pen in 8094. I guess you can try to make linear actuators out of them, but they're often too rare and fragile for that."

The finished “boom / jib / scoop thing” (=BJST) :-| X-D thanks for viewing the pictures, I hope you enjoyed it! Another great review and a wonderful set of pictures. I like your nomenclature for the BJST. Acronyms always sound nicely scientific; much better than ""digger"". No one would know you made it up until they found out what it means. I also really like what I will call your ""kinetic photos"". They convey a sense of motion and show the range of the mechanism without the big file sizes of animations. How long of a shutter speed did you use? The secret to not getting too much friction in the turntable is using extra nuts and jamming them together. You don't want to actually clamp the nuts tight across the turntable. You want to jam two nuts tightly together at each end which prevents them from unwinding, but still leave a little free play (gap). This way it will hold the assembly together but not prevent it from moving. Mine moves quite easily. This same concept is used on the pen plotter or 8094. ""Slewed""? I think that's a word. How about ""slewn"" or ""slain"" or ""slewifacated""? I think ""rotated"" is best. *sweet* Eric"

I also see from your room photos that you have the 8839 Supply Ship which has lots of white. This is a really nice set. 8462 is hard to call old school, but at least it uses regular beams. The air tanks are the best part of the set. I wish LEGO had used them more often, especially on the highly pneumatic sets. The tank makes all the difference on 8459. You are right, 8458 is certainly not old school, but it is a great set with wonderful suspension. It is of the same era as the Super Street Sensation with all of the panels for body contouring. 8868 is Technic at its best. There is nothing else like it, especially with the compressor.

While the assembly you have drawn would work as a linear actuator, I would not recommend it. The torsional stiffness and strength of an axle are proportional to the polar moment of inertia, a section property. Most of the stiffness comes from the outside of the cross shaped axle. But in the threaded axle, you lose all the stiffness of the outer area because it is not continuous. This means you only get stiffness and strength from the small core. I think the threaded axle would bend and break very easily if subjected to much torque. Eric"

They made many changes to Technic the following year, with models becoming predominantly studless and making heavy use of the flexible axles/hoses and decorative panels. The Technic logo and box art style was also changed a lot. I really like the overall construction of that set. The model is fairly lightweight but extremely sturdy. It must be one of the strongest large sets they've released. Quote Did you had something like this in mind? That's basically the idea.

This is my second review and the first review of this paticular set and the only one on EuroBricks... at the moment X-D So without further ado I present to you my review... (I like that saying so much I decided to use it again in this review, it's originally from my review of 8158, which can be seen here.) Note: Sorry that this review got delayed, but there was a hostile takeover of the computer, X-O don't worry everythings fine now. X-D Set: 8159 Racer X Vs Taejo Theme: Speed Racer Price: $19.99US Pieces: 237 Minifigs: 2 Note 2: I did not take photos of just the new pieces this time because they're the same ""new"" pieces as in 8158, just in diff. colors. If you want to see a picture of them click here. First off pictures of the Box, Instructions, DSS, and Minifigs: Not quite as many stickers as set 8158, but there still are quite a few. Can you guess which ones which? :-D Yes, Taejo's hair really is Red and Black, for Racer X's head TLG just reused the baddie's head from 7620. |-/ Now onto the build: First Racer X's X Racer :-D (Thats not it's official name.. I think.) :-$ Back end of the car. The cockpit, and yeah there are no seats for Racer X's hiny, just a flat 2x2 Dark Bley plate. The cockpit and rearend of the car connect using an S-shaped connector piece. The front part of the car. The fornt and the cockpit are also connected using an S-shaped connector piece. Adding some details including Yellow fenders. The underside of the car, so far. Adding some more detail. Newly added motor vents and smooth details. Adding a front bumper, amongst other things. Side view of the car, so far. ""No backseat driving, wait a minute, there's no backseat!"" The underside with newly added axles. Demonstrating how hubcap piece is put on the car. Now onto Taejo's GRR (Glorious Red Racer) :-P Front part of the car. Cockpit, regular seats... check. Cocpit and rearend of the car connected using S-shaped connector piece. Adding some detail. The front part of the car. Front and cockpit connected also using the S-shaped connector piece. Adding some fenders to the car. Underside of the car, so far. Adding some smooth details. Taejos is the only car with an actual hood. Side view of the car, so far. Underside of the car with axels. Now some finished shots of both cars: First Racer X's fine Black and Yellow racer Reminds me of an older Ferrari from this angle. Up close and personal. I'm guessing the 3 holes are exhaust outlets. Racer X rollin'. Now it's time for Taejo's Red racer ""I could've sworn I ordered some hubcaps!"" -guess who... Taejo Racer X admiring Taejo's fine red automobile. Up close with 'Big Red'. Rearend shot of the car. ""I challenge you Racer X!"" -Taejo Racer X bein' a complete badass and smokin' Taejo. >:-) Now for some comparison shots: (The Silver pocket knife is just to hold up Taejo's car.) Now a shot of the extra pieces: Now if you combine 8158 with 8159, you get this: ""Go, Go, Go!"" Now it's time for the summary: This set is an excellent buy at $20 dollars, it's well designed and has lot's of details, it also has very unique minifigs. (Which are always good in a set.) It's only downfalls are the lack of acessories for the minifigs and that there are no cool contraptions on the cars, and by ""cool"" I mean lethal to the other racer(s). Now to the scoring of the set: Price:10/10 Pieces: 8/10 Too many stickers for such a small set. Minifigs: 10/10 Unique and creative. Playability: 9/10 Would have been perfect except for the lack of acessories and cool contraptions on the cars. (But both are easily modified/fixed hence the nine.) Overall: 37/40 A great set! Bonus: Try and count how many times my Silver pocket knife appears and win... the knowledge of knowing how many times the Silver pocket knife appears. :-P :-D This concludes the review, more pictures of either set 8158 or 8159 or both available through request, via PM-ing me. ;-) See ya' next time folks... of course I don't mean that literally X-D ...

This small set is the same size and price range as last year's 4939 Cool Cars reviewed by prateek and dillthepill. The box General info You get 193 pieces (vs 206 for Cool Cars) which is quite a lot, but most of them are small. There are a lot of hinges and some good slopes and wings. The building instructions contains three models, but no further ideas for inspiration. Primary model: Spider The first model is a big spider which shares some similarities to the secondary model of 4895 Power in the design. The legs each have 3 joints, where the ones in the middle have ""stud joints"" to be moved sideways while the rest use hinges for all joints. There are 8 of them and it does get a little tedious with all the repetitive building in this relatively small model. I like the design of the face with a lot of eyes and a big and ugly mouth, but the real gem is the X-pattern on the opisthosoma made using double/inverted slopes. It is poseable and I think it looks more ""fierce"" when inverted. Secondary model: Snake The face of the snake is nicely detailed with a splitting tongue and a mouth than can move a little. There is a problem with the construction. It uses stacked hinges for some of the joints, which are hard to pull apart without stressing the pieces. Tertiary model: Fly I'm not completely sure what this insect is. I will say it's a fly, although the tail and head are too pointy. This is a neat little thing. Conclusion Primary model: 8 It is a good design, but lacks some sturdiness in the legs. They fall off a little too easily. Secondary models: 6 They are pretty good when you look at the bricks that are available, but they don't wow you in any way and they suffer from the same issues as the primary model regarding sturdiness. Alternate models: 3 It is hard to come up with alternate models with so many small pieces and plates that are only 1 stud wide. The colors might make you want to build a Spyrius space ship. Playability: 8 The models have many movable joints and you can put quite a scare into your minifigs when their town gets attacked by these creatures... unless some EN forces are there to protect them. Price: 6 Creator sets are known for their great price to bricks ratio, but this set doesn't quite measure up to sets like Cool Cars. Pieces: 7 The pieces aren't great by themselves, but who doesn't need a fist full of hinges, slopes and basic plates in standard colors? I don't think this is a must-have set like the big rig was last year. The pieces are great and it has a nice primary model, but the set lacks a bit when it comes to the usual strong Creator qualities like alternate models and price.

It was released as a Legend set in 2001, but due to poor sales was discontinued again. The largest of the Islander sets, Enchanted Island is a portion of an island with a river running through. The left hand side features some sturdy buildings built into a tree-like structure on a rocky outcrop, whilst the left hand side features a tower built out of ""wooden"" posts and a large tribal statue. The box cover shows all the details; it does, however, differ from the instructions' finished product in that it has been more aesthetically arranged - bushes e.t.c. have been moved to fill in gaps and to not obscure other things. The sides of the box show nothing particularly special, although in one scene it depicts the Islander Canoe chasing the Pirate boat with the treasure; just one way to play with the set. The back of the box, however, is superb, featuring a large number of alternative models: a toothy statue, a Pirate tree (think Wolfpack) with an Islander base, Kahuka's throne, a fire-breathing statue and a souped-up boat for the pirates. These, and many more, can be easily made because of the large diversity of pieces. The set has a huge number of minifigures for its size, the third highest number in the Pirate range (The SES and the BSB being first and second, respectively) - a whopping 7! 5 Islanders, including the all-too-common King Kahuka, the elusive Islander babe and 3 standard warriors - this set alone will never leave you short of enemies! 2 pirates, Ironhook in his standard attire with a scurvy dog at his side attack the island, although they are only moderately armed - 2 cutlasses and a pistol between them; a musket would've been nice. The Islanders, on the other hand, have 4 shields, a bow and quiver and 6 spears, not to mention the big pokey thing with horns on top (Weapon? Idol? Staff?). A monkey, parrot and crocodile provide the obvious creature features, with a fair amount of gold to finish off. In the instructions, the goblet does not have the lid, although it does on the box; it's a nice touch anyway - adding a little more diversity to the monotonous treasure stashes. The pirates' boat is a nice 2 sail vessel, with oars for when the wind stops and a treasure map. The sails are similar to those in Lagoon Lockup, but with an extra front sail. It's an awesome little boat, better for raids than a rowing boat, but not too big that it can't sail up rivers. It can comfortably fit 2 men and, at a squeeze, 5. The sails are expensive if you buy them seperately; normally this won't be a problem, but they can cost aroun $5 each. The Islanders' boat is a canoe with a sail and an outrigger to stabilise it. The sail is beautifully done, with 2 spars taughtening it. There is a clip for the rower to leave his weapon when at se and the mast can turn to get as much wind as possible. It's quite a top-heavy boat, but it doesn't look hideous and without the mast/sail it looks great. 3 Islanders can fit in it, and more if they sit on the outrigger. The markings on the canoe are stickers, but they look fine and are probably more robust than markings for their job. Furthermore, they're waterproof! *sing* Kahuka's throne can be carried by 2 loyal subjects... ...Or strapped to his pet crocodile! The clips on the side can be used to rest his weaponry, or hold spears for battle. The throne looks nice, although I'm not too sure about the blue against the red - I'd have prefered white as it would clash less... An overview of the island; it is built in 2 halves - left then right and then joined together loosley, so it can be seperated for transporting. Around the back to the left and right, there are large open spaces that are great for battles - this set isn't so much about a large solid build, but creating a ""village"" - smaller structures linked by bridges. And the back... To the far left is a platform built onto the rock, with access from the river via a ladder. There's the standard Islander drum with the lovely zebra-skin part (Where did they get that?!). I've never understood the white flag - I was under the impression it was used for surrender... Further along the rocky bank, there are some hinged palm leaves that swing upwards to reveal... ...The treasure! It's an OK hiding place; not the best place to hide it, right where the pirates sail past, but it feels fabulous; it fits right in. Above it on the rocky bank is the main structure. It looks very disjointed when you build it (bricks all over the place), but once it's done it looks nice and rural, with leaves everywhere and the ""balcony"" where Kahuka is standing. You get a nice roof made from 2 large palm leaves tilting down. Around the back there's a slight shelter, a table for picnics and a ladder to access the upstairs. I was rather annoyed that it is so open, but the set is designed from just one perspective... To the left is the bridge to the other building... A nice, one piece bridge made of the softer plastic used for muskets and the post-1991 cutlasses. It looks good, but be warned! It tilts when you pull a pin, sending the pirates flying! This contraption is a good idea, but it is very stiff and so doesn't swing, even when burdened by a minifigure - you'll want to modify this bit if you get it. The other building looks like it is made out of posts and beams. They are all red; brown would have been better, but it would have added too many colours to the range, just like the use of black for trees in some forestmen sets. There are 3 clips for spare weapons; only 2 of these will ever be used when all the Islanders are armed, but it gives the pirates scope once they've been disarmed...There's another nice palm tree roof on top. 2 ladders give access...there's a total of 4 in this set - worth getting, eh? Although they're 5p on Bricklink, for a KABOB, they're like gold! At the top there's another hidey hole; the palm leaves lift up on hinges to show the treasure or hiding Islander. It can be seen from behind, but this set is designed from one perspective only. Nice cattlehorns too...alongside the slats you can see in the floor - 5 years later and it would've been a solid plate... The big statue is one of the main selling point of this set, alongside the tilting bridge - they're the action features shown in every catalogue at the time, but it is not really special, just original. The statue fits in with the theme perfectly - Kahuka's mask, his shield and this statue all depict the same deity, which is a nice ""collectible"" idea. The back is rather plain, except the angled 1x1 bricks - a good touch. I'm not sure why there's a black brick in the back of the head, but this is easily remedied; it could even be done with a brick from this same set, just swapping the two over... Aside from the head turning, the back can open to store sacred objects, or, in my opinion, prisoners, hence the gaps for breathing. Either way, it's a lovely piece of architecture and deservedly a flagship element of the set. There's your standard cooking pot floating around, although a 1x1 yellow stud as human flesh (remember, minifigs are yellow, no matter what the licensed themes say!) is a superb finish. This set is a stunning set for both kids and AFOLs who are just getting back into Lego/Pirates - it is a great army builder and, due to its release as a Legend, is extremely cheap on eBay - you should be able to pick one up for £18, or £15 if you're lucky. For that you get a lifetime's supply of Islanders, 4 ladders, some wall panels, 2 baseplates (one raised and both with rivers and printed vegetation around the edge), a ton of weapons, a fair quantity of standard bricks, but most of all, a heap of vegetation: This is an easy to buy set, with normally around 5 on eBay at any time, and is well worth it, for the parts, the play and the nostalgia! It can be easily modified; when used in conjunction with any other outpost, a much larger fortress can be made, especially if more rope bridges are used. if you pick 2 of this fine set off eBay (It'll still be less than the original price!), a huge complex can be constructed, giving you an instantaneous village for around £35.

I was in my dark ages throughout the Islander days, though I have built up a small force of them (10?) from eBay buys, but no actual sets. If this is really as reasonable as you say there, I may just have to pick one up soon. Oddly, I do own the baseplates to this set, having also picked them up in a lot on eBay, so I might be able to recreate it manually, but I think I'd rather pick one up whole. It looks like a great mix of parts and makes a decent looking display piece. Thanks again for the fine review! *y*"

I only recently bought this set off Ebay (pretty good deal: MISB for 30 euro's!) and I enjoyed putting it together and mixing it with the other Piratesets. When you put two sets of two baseplates together you'll get a large pond with an island in the center, just to achieve that I bought two more baseplates off Ebay. The result is this MOC. I always loved the Islanders and have most of the sets, not all of them but that is going to change in the future. *y*"

This set is on my list to get. I especially like the speedy pirate boat, and the also very fast outrigger canoe with a sail. I don't think a small number of these cannibals will make much of an impact on gaming though, even if they get a bonus with spears. Duke"

Enchanted Island, aside from having so alluring a name was good value for money in that you only needed this one set and you had a good representation of the islanders both in the size of the set and the number of minifigs. The flipping rope bridge and the river give it a great rainforest retreat sort of feeling and one is inclined to think of this set as more inland than directly coastal for me. Whilst the Islanders were never seen in the same light or popularity as Pirates and Imperials they were an obvious and colourful addition that to me added a whole new depth to the Pirate system and one was now able to play a 3 or 4 way war adding a greater political element to the sets. Enchanted Island is probably the 3rd most appealing of the large land bases for me after Port Royal and Eldorado Fortress. Good review and glad to see the set recognised!"

I loved Pirates in my childhood, but that was before the Islander and Spanish stuff... mine were the BSB and soldier fortress with the big baseplate. As I'm now returning to Pirates, I've tracked down most of the 2009 sets and of course bought the new 2015 sets... but knowing I missed this ""middle"" period of Islanders vs Pirates makes me a bit sad... those Islanders are soooo ""Monkey Island"" (those of my age likely feel the same) to my eyes! Oh for a ""Lemonhead"" minfig... ;) I'm curious now how much this set sells for, given it was apparently one of very few Lego actually re-released! I recently bought a MISB BSB that was an early 2000's re-release, and it was very pricey... but then, I suspect the BSB has a LOT more of a nostalgic following these days than this set! Can anyone give me a rough idea what this set goes for in as-new condition these days? Regardless, a fantastic review with some great photos of the whole set and minifigs... even though this is an old thread, I am glad someone else bumped it recently so I can add my thoughts too. :) One thing I've noticed comparing the newest Pirates sets to the 80's ones I had as a kid (and these from the 90's) is the move away from baseplates and big ""panel"" pieces. I actually like that in a lot of ways; whilst I miss baseplates being included as they are a great starting point for creating new things (and make the sets easier to ""play"" with), visually, I think Lego-designed model sets look better without them."

My only gripe about them is that Cannonball Taylor's car (the black and yellow one) was a missed opportunity, as in the movie it's yellow and purple.

I'll review 8868, 8880, Space Police II, Blacktron II... And I WILL. It's just the time that is blocking me. And my university. And the fact that I just picked up 8460 in original box for only EUR 36,50...! *sweet* The other reviews will follow - please bear with me. And this set review is also a gift to this nice fellow who gave me the title! That's what I'm talking about: #1 useless information with high numbers: This set contains 841 parts and was released in 1995 in the TECHNIC / Tech Build / Advanced (sub-) theme. The bricklink price guide displays for “Used” a Qty Avg Price of $125.85 and for “New” a Qty Avg Price of $212.82. I got it for $56,98. Still can’t believe it. :'-) This set was rereleased two times (8431 in 2002 and 8438 in 2003). #2 the box: Front: Back: Open: The box is higher than other Technic boxes. Why? I don’t know. 8460 doesn’t have any real large parts. Whatever. Inlay: I wonder why TLG doesn’t make inlays anymore… They’re noisy and brake easily but are great for (pre-) sorting. #3 building instructions: I will quote myself from the 8862 review: Quote Wow these instructions are used! I'm not used to this after all this sets with unread instruction booklets... Triple-wow! ‘nuff said. This is the “first” page. (Fortunately Peeron offers scans!) The last step for the alternate model and a few nice photos showing how the pneumatic pump will be erm- pumped. Yeah. Random page: I forgot the overall thoughts to the instructions: These are Technic instructions as we’re used to them: part count, easy to understand (okay, the string part at the end was too much for me) and the color distinction is okay too. 100 pages long and if I can trust my eyes the pneumatics page can be fold out. (I don’t have this page but I assume it.) #4 the parts: #5 building: An easy and fun build. Okay, this could take some time. My longest building review up to date. The front steering: The rear steering. The axle pin between the rear steering is for the axle which rotates the crane. The two worm screws in the front are for the outriggers (they’re not linked. One for each side.) The small wheel in the back is for the rotation. Adjusting front and rear steering. outriggers are finished. You can notice a 8 tooth gear that will rotate the Technic Turntable. A steering wheel has been added. Could be the same stickers like the alternate 8880 used to have. The steering can be operated with both actinic lights (?) No. We’re far from finished. I’ve got a lot of parts left at this point. Wow. A 4x4 corner plate! Pneumatics and a winch: If you can’t recognize it on the photo: The Technic Beams are the erm- wrong/other side up. The 1x6 Technic Beams on the left side are normal. The axle that will extend the crane: 7 gear racks 1x4 the 1x6 Technic plate will keep the two pneumatic cylinders straight. *sad* 8-| Huh? Did you blink? You missed a special part: The whole rotatable thing will be attached to the Technic turntable using two long Technic pins. The pin on the right side should be in the middle of the three “turntable holes”. On the right side, it’s the first hole. Asymmetric! Why? Because we’ll add a cute cab! #6 functionality: You can find the features in comparison to other Technic cranes here. Technopedia, of course. I made one ""sentence"" out of it: (please don’t find any mistakes.) :-P “two axle rack and pinion steering, pneumatic luffing and gear driven telescoping via crank for the boom which can slew 360° on turntable driven via gear, crank driven hoist and gear driven outriggers at four corners which snap over center.” #7 random shots: Comparison to 8854: uuuh… once again a depth of field. I tried to make it look authoritarian like 8858 but I failed. Somehow 8460 looks cute. #8 comparison to 8421 Mobile Crane / Crane Truck: I feel that a question concerning this will be asked, so I deal with it right now. First of all: I don’t own 8421 yet. I know. A Technic freak really should own it. Anyway: 8421 has more than twice as much parts as 8460, is motorized, features a V6-engine and a very neat mechanism to extend the crane/boom twice using a braided string with end studs. Try to find out how! Of course 8421 features (far) more than 8460. IMHO 8421 should have been a copy of 8460, a set so successful that it has been rereleased two times, but the designers overshoot the mark. 8421 is a (breathtaking) monster. Compared to it, 8460 looks cute - not pale! #9 final thoughts: I got it on eBay in kind of good condition, for about 50 dollars. I know that it has been worth the money in any point of view. *wub* I didn’t use the word “old-school” for now.

You have managed to review my all time favourite technic set! It was the first large Technic set I was given by my parents, when it first came out in 1995. I played for hours with this set, making minifig seats in it (it was so huge there was room for four minifigs to sit next to eachother in front....) I made various applications for it, a bungee-jump system with a large rubber band, and lots of containers to be lifted. The first changes I made included the inverting of the wheels and the disabling of one of the flashlight-steering wheels because they obstructed eachother. By the way, the nob for your winch is yellow instead of black (I know this set by heart, so watch out :-P ). I always liked those nobs. I do own the 8421 and I can tell you: this 8460 is much, much stronger, it can carry more weight because the boom is lighter then the 8421: they are powered by the same two pistons... You know when you made it right: when the crane is in upright position, fully extended and you release the brake from the winch. Does the hook lower without having to pull it? If it does, you succeeded in constructing the set right. The alternate model was great fun too, the pump is cleverly hidden and the crane folds up great between the cab and the loading platform. You could easily mod it with a pneumatic claw on the crane, a motor to turn it and a compressor. The only flaw was the loading platform which had no floor (only some axles). Thanks so much for reviving my memorie concerning this great set! *y*"

This was a great set for its time but the 8421 definitely looks better to me. I've been trying to find a good deal on it on ebay but it's pretty expensive, considering that it only went out of production last year. Quote Inlay: I wonder why TLG doesn’t make inlays anymore… They’re noisy and brake easily but are great for (pre-) sorting. The box designs in general are crappier these days than they used to be 10 years ago. You don't see the old ""featured parts"" trays anymore and the boxes don't have the different sections either (these also acted as internal supports for larger boxes, so they were less prone to being crushed). The cardboard material is also quite a bit thinner. I think it's a result of TLC's overall cost-cutting moves since then. Most people toss the boxes and probably don't care, but I keep all of them. There was actually a time when the boxes used to be even stronger. I have an old 8859 set and the outer box is made of a hard, styrofoam material, although they probably stopped using that for environmental reasons. Edited by CP5670, 06 April 2008 - 10:13 PM."

I don't think I've never seen the alternate model before. Personally I prefer 8421 because I think it looks much better and I love the six wheel steering. I also love the three segment boom and the transmission; they fit it all in so neatly. I realise that it has trouble even holding up itself, but ultimately it doesn't matter as it's not like you are really going to construction work with it. What bothers me more about 8421 is the design change in the boom from chainlinks to strings. I would try to mod mine but all I have is the prototype picture to base it on... and I don't have enough links anyway! :-P BerndDasBrot, on Apr 7 2008, 07:29 AM, said: yeah, somehow I wonderd why only VBBN (thanks!) responded...

With your review, I can now truly appreciate all the details of the set. I got to admit, I can see the appeal now! That comparison shot you took is amazing.

For the figs, we’ve got Indy of course, Marion and two Russian soldiers, nothing special here. In the back of the tree, there is a box, to put some things: The amphibious vehicle is very nice! The proportions are really great (not too big, not too small) and there are a lot of details everywhere, like the propeller: A back view: An inside view: The small boat is a dark grey Zodiac, but the details are nice too, giving it a retro look, in the same way of all the Indy vehicles: The outpost has a net to permit to the bad guys to capture some nice guys and girls… But it seems that the girl Marion is scared of the nice croco! So Indy comes and help her pushing the Technic axle with this round inversed tiles, which push out the net and capture the croco. Now Marion feels happier! And she takes a can of oil and whacks the poor croco, without defences! Who has said Marion is a nice girl? So, I’ve bought this set like an add on to my city. In fact, the elements of this set can easily be integrated in a town layout. I plan to use the outpost for my forest section, and the amphibious vehicle is always a nice touch of originality in a layout. Yes you can use all those military things without creating an army in a layout: just put the violent parts out, and you’ve got nice things, like a biologist car in the case of the amphibious vehicle!"

This set has everything, a croc, very nice MFs, a neat tree trap, a cool zodiac and a marvelous and very detailed amphibious car in a beautiful color scheme. The only thing I´m not colpletely sure is the design of that jerrycan (thanks for the right word and the interesting link, Kingboy ). Although the use of the revolver´s pretty clever indeed and fits well too, it´s still clearly, well, a revolver.... very unusual and interesting for an official TLC design."

You can’t enter into the cave, because there is a spider web with its spider…Unless… Unless you know how the mechanism works and the spider web go up… And reveals a case with diamonds and accessories. A closer view on the mechanism (which is simple but works well), and you can also see the difference, or maybe the same, size of a spider and a giant ant! And I’ve always thought that those spiders were very big compared to the minifigs! So those ants are really giant! Poor small frog! The three trees with the entrance make a nice jungle layout! Don’t speak too loud, you will wake up the soldier… Don’t worry for him, he will be waken up by the vehicle before being eaten by those giant ants! A front view, making the vehicle really menacing! A back view: Push the red part from the back and there are two parts that fall down from the vehicle. I don’t know why… The movie will clarify this I think… And here you can see how the two big circular blades turn when you push the vehicle… Simple but effective! Run Indy, run! This set is really nice. The playability of the different elements is great, the colour scheme is nice too (I like those dark green tree parts!). The vehicle is really impressive without being too big and its very well details! In general the designers of the Indy sets have made a really nice works, with a lot of efforts in all those details everywhere! I’ve got some project for this set, to integrate it in my city... I’m a city mocer, and not an Indy fan. So I don’t have bought the temple, the bigger set of the series, because it has nothing special for me in term of part selections or in the design, in relation with the town theme, and because my supermarket doesn’t have it yet!

Plenty of great features, and very detailed, with much of the engine showing and a decent cockpit (if that's the right word..). The general and the two Soviets are great too (could we have a close-up pic of them please? ), good to see that neither torso has exposed fleshy skin like the Nazis.

The right side of the mountain has a ladder and a removable rock face. The left side has some stairs leading up to the top. I love this tree design. simple yet effective. A shot of the top- Hey, what are you doing?!? NO!! Throw him in the dungeon! Overall: This set when first released in 1993 was priced at $43USD, although that might just be because of the Juniorised pieces (6 BURPs!). It's a fun set that provides excellent playability. If you can find it at a $20-$30 price point, pick it up. Overall grade: 8/10 Edited by KimT, 10 August 2008 - 01:33 PM."

I always liked the BURPs, I don't know why. Maybe because they were dark grey and dark grey pieces seemed a bit hard to come by at the time. I always assumed that the dragon was, sort of, the mascot of the Dragon Masters. The wizard was there to keep him under control so he wouldn't turn on them. I always figured that the wizard was working with the Dragon Master King, and they were fighting against the Royal Knights (the dudes with the lion faces on their torsos), or whatever they were called. I like this set a lot. I think the castle theme declined after the Dragon Masters and Royal Knights themes were discontinued. The new knights never really took the cake. It's funny, but it seems, to me anyways, that when the Lego Minifigs lost their regular smile/smirk faces (whether they were masked by a beard or not), that's when Lego began to decline...a bit. The Dragon Masters had their vicious faces and all, but they still had that smile/smirk underneath their rough exteriors. The new knights look a little...less confident."

It looks great, and it's fun to ride around in the house. I hoped to find a figure the right size for it, but none of mine would fit. Unlike a lot of Technic models, it looks good from all angles. Considering the size of the model it has a complicated way of connecting the engine to the wheel. The rear shocks are just the right stiffness... ...and they have a good amount of travel. I thought these shocks were new. I need to get out more... Functions: Shocks: Two front, one stiffer one in the rear. Drivetrain: 2 piston engine linked to the rear wheel via gears and a chainlink. Steering: Yes it does... Stand: Retractable. For the price, size and subject, what else could be added? 10/10 Parts: Considering that it has three shocks and a 40 chainlinks it's a great set for parts. Some hard to use large parts are included, but they are not overused. The usage of the green does limit part usage somewhat though, and I'll be struggling to find a use for those wheels for anything other than a motorbike. 8/10 Price: At $39.99 AUD for 248 parts it isn't the best value set. The US price is $25.00 which is somewhat better. It does have some more complicated parts however. 7/10 Looks: Lego seems to be moving away from the see-though look for Technic sets and this is a good example of it. I'm not a big fan of fairings but I think they work great in this set as a fuel tank. 8/10 Fudge: This set was great for me as I have never had a Technic bike. However for those that want this for just parts or have other bikes it could be a hard sell. The alternate model (a chopper) is a complete rebuild (which I didn't make), and it's great that Lego have been including these most of the time lately. 7/10 Overall: Recommended. 8/10"

I like the use of fairings on this bike. The only thing I really don't like about the Technics bikes in general, is the ""clumsy"" design of the chaindrive. It sticks way to much out to the side. If they made a really big bike model, it would be more in place with this chain drive. I'm not sure if it wouldn't be possible to design a shaft drive to the rear wheel, ala BMW style. But the green ""Kawasaki"" look great with the front and rear suspension. I have the Street Bike, 8420, a somewhat larger and more complicated set, and will probably add the motocross bike to my collection soon.

It seemed to be just a nice looking truck with a small motor... but when I found out it had a transmission I changed my mind! Here is the transmission. It allows the single motor to be used for two functions. This system has been around for a while, and Lego seem to be using it more and more. The Transmission Driving Ring alone (the red circle) goes for $5-15 USD on BrickLink, and you also need the Catch and Clutch Gear so I have been buying sets that have them instead. I now have enough parts to make a Supercar gearbox. (I bet a new supercar comes out next year now...) This is the gear that rotates the arm. Note the colour of the 24 tooth gear; it seems to be a new gear trend. A lot of work has been put into this truck looking real. Personally I think they went too far as the truck seems to have been designed for a tilting cab, but it's disabled to prevent breaking the front. Bottom of the transmission. The bottom shaft lifts the arm. Note that there are more dark grey gears. The motor fits in very well also. The bottom of the arm. I was surprised by the usage of a 12 Tooth Bevel to link with the 36 Tooth Double Bevel as I had never seen that done before. As you can see there is no room for any drive train. Standard steering for a recent technic truck. There is a hand-of-god at the cab top that links via two Knob Wheels. It looks good from the back. You can also see the white Clutch that connects the transmission to the motor to avoid burnouts. It goes decently high, and can go a bit higher if you use the crane arm. Compared to last years fire truck. (If I didn't buy the fire truck for half price I would have been annoyed that Lego brought out what is almost a motorised version of the same set.) Functions: Cherry Picker Arm: Motorised rotate and lift that links to a motor via a transmission and anti-burnout clutch. Steering: Rack and pinion controlled via a hand-of-god linked by Knob Wheels Doors: Open and close. Good functionality that works well, but I wish they made the cab lift and I'm a bit sick of the lame fairing door trick. 7/10 Parts: Motor, battery box, transmission, clutch, practical wheels, only two fairings, compact turntable... this is a great parts set. 10/10 Price: At $99.99 AUD for 726 parts it's OK value when you consider what you are getting. The US price is $60.00 which is better, but still not great. I bought mine for $80 AUD which was good however, and I suspect that the price is designed for easy sale...8/10 Looks: I'd buy this for the looks alone! 9/10 Fudge: The functions work well and I llked it more than I thought I would. Oddly mine seemed to be missing a Axle Pin with Friction, but since it includes extra parts for the alternate model I didn't mind using one of my spares. On the subject of the alternate model, it is a dump truck which is made out to be a total re-build, but it isn't. It could have easily been done like Super Street Sensation was, but Lego have probably determined that instructions like that confuse people. 8/10 Overall: Recommended. 8/10"

Luckily I'm a sucker for spooky old temples, filled with devilish traps and hidden treasures, hissing fountains and overgrown foliage, creepy skeletons and crumbling stonework, so here it is: Indiana Jones 7627, Temple of the Crystal Skull. Part 1: The Figs First off, the figs - 6 humans and 4 skellies (or should that be skullies? ) Indy, Mutt, Irina, and that sneery Russian guy that's in the 2 smaller sets. Nothing new here. Aha! What have we here - two natives. I wonder if hair is a sign of power in this culture, since one guy is completely bald and the other one has the most extraordinarily luxurious black mullet. Somehow I doubt the movie will answer this question. Back view - as you can see, the scalp tattoos are also popular in this tribe. Fashion conscious! (Note in the background the paws of the fearsome black jungle panther, ie my cat, curious as to see what the tribe was up to.) Also, don't ask me why these guys are carrying axes rather than, say, spears. And what everyone's been waiting for, the skullies - three of 'em and a conquistador skellie - very cute. Note the backs of the crystal head have a plume-sized hole - or maybe that's just where they injected the blue brain-plastic. Spooky! I love these skulls, I wasn't sold from the initial pics but they have a very creepy smile and the head shape is just... weird. With the large eyes, it's kind of Homer Simpson-esque. And here we have the token vehicle in the set - a weird little tank thing with treads. Kind of looks like a cross between the amphibious boat and a mini-tank. I'm sure there's a military expert around here who can tell us exactly what it is supposed to be. The treads are nice, but the rest of it is a bit thrown together. You can tell they wanted to keep the dark green colour scheme but the budget only allowed them 5 parts to do so . All in all, a mixed bag with the figs. 4 repeats from the cheaper sets which means we have one new native figure and the crystal skullies. There are heaps of the old-skool skele heads scattered around the sets so those that prefer can replace the skullies with ordinary skellies. Bizarrely, the top of the box which has the line of 1:1 figs pic (you know what I mean) doesn't have names for any of the characters, whereas all the smaller sets do. Part 2: Box, Parts Front of box: Back of box: Two instruction books: Parts. This set has come under criticism for being overpriced - myself included - but the official piece count is 900 plus, which is pretty good considering it also contains the baseplate. 6 big bags and 2 of those 12x12 bricks in dark tan. (Note: set does not contain live Black Jungle Panther™) The DSS, helpfully comes pre-scrunched thanks to TLC. Even in a $AUD150 set they can't get that right... sigh. The dark tan baseplate. Say what you like, I'm in love. I know some people don't like these, but they were such a staple of Castle/ Pirates for so many years that I don't consider them a juniorised piece at all. This one, recycled from the 05 Police HQ and 06 Hospital, is much better in design than the King Leo's Castle one as the different heights and asymmetry make it look much more like a natural piece of ground. Perfect for MOCs. And it's dark tan - how could anyone not love such a huge slab of dark tan? Note this love doesn't extend to applying the stonework stickers which are, frankly, crap. Random instructions page: Part 3: Temple of Doom - or just a doomed temple? The complete set, front view. Isometricish view: Back view: Top view: First impressions? It's very dark tan, isn't it? And green. And bright green. And dark green. And dark red. And normal tan. And dark bley. And pearl gold! In fact, it's a bit of a mish-mash of colours. I'm of two minds about this. I kind of prefer the palette to be a bit subtler, but I can see that a playset designed for kids isn't going to sell bucketloads all tastefully done in shades of tan with lashings of dark-green foliage. There's a huge amount of dark red in this set, which is always a welcome colour, but I'm not convinced it quite works with the 2 shades of tan on offer here. On the plus side, there's also a huge amount of dark tan in ordinary 2x2 bricks, tiles, plates and 1x1 and 1x2x3 slopes, which is great for anyone wanting to stock up. Let's take a closer look. I'll do this roughly in order of the build itself: a) The big scary face. This is a simple, fun build and very effective at projecting menace at the temple entrance. It actually detaches very easily from the temple (as pictured on the box art) to allow easier access to the inside. The eyes are flick-fire missiles, with Scary Face's hair conveniently providing ammo refills should you run out. All in all, from me. (b) The Back Spin the skelly head and stone steps appear - we haven't seen this feature in a while. Nice to get these pieces in dark bley. A conquistador hides under the stairs - this is a bit useless as the stairs can't fully extend while he's there . Moving right... a trapdoor - what could possibly be behind it??!!??!!? Answer: not much, really. A little red stair. I really like these 2 stickers though - very intricate. The staircase leads to what I like to think of as the Crystal Skull Transmogrification Chamber. Now, I know nothing about the movie except that it's supposed to be have a kind of 50s B-movie plot rumoured to feature (look away, spoiler-haters)..... aliens. These weird, creepy gold chairs look made from the bones of aliens if you ask me, with their strange vertebrae and silver claws. It wouldn't surprise me if bringing these aliens back to life was part of the plot of the movie... hence the crystal skull? I guess we'll find out May 22. In any case, transforming aliens clearly like a disco whirl as when you pull the handle, the whole of this assembly spins giddily around. A very clever and simple trick - it's basically just a wheel under the platform but the effect is great. Also under here is a bottomless pit (stickered)... I would very much expect a villian to be thrown down it at some point. ""So, do you come here often?"" ""I don't know who designed this club. These chairs are REALLY uncomfortable."" NB. I am really, really over those pearl gold 1x2 roof corner slopes which started popping up in the 2006 Castle range, infected Exo-Force and have now spread here. Can we please have these in a different colour? Or a different pearl gold piece? Pretty please? ( c) Left tower (looking from the front) A small tower with a trans clear gem. (d) Right tower Waterfall with booby trap. I like the sticker, it's very cartoony, which fits with the set somehow. When you turn the wheel, flick fire missiles spray out and hit whoever is on the stairs. Both towers have a trap where if you move the skull, another one pops out from the dragon mouth. (e) Central turret thing This thing is kind of annoying and doesn't really sit or work well. It's kind of like a laser beam sending messages to space, I guess. As the central dome rises, the two plates peel away. I find it is a little bit tight to work smoothly and the two plates doesn't really sit well together at the top. Maybe I just need to rebuild it. I'm sure this will also be explained in the movie. (f) Final trap - the stair that isn't there The final trap is at the front - as Indy goes down the staircase, you can push the red heads and all the 1x8 bley bricks come tumbling down. Simple and works well. (g) Alternate view Here's how it looks as pictured on the box with the head removed. As you can see, this allows better access to the centre of the temple. As you can see, sadly there is nothing actually interesting there except a staircase to the turret and 2 dark tan slopes which are just stuck there and look a little out of place. I mean, come on, everything else has a splash of dark red and gold! Your Destination: Nowhere! Part 4: In Conclusion So after all those endless pics, what about the set itself? CONS:As a playset, 7627 doesn't quite make sense. Admittedly, the traps that are there are well-designed and unobtrusive. On the other hand, there's a great big whopping entrance at the front - but I wasn't sure if the figs are supposed to sneak in through the backdoor and go up the spiral staircase and past the waterfall (as shown in the box art) or if they were meant to end up in the golden skull room. The middle area doesn't really connect with anything, nor does the giant space turret. It may be that some of these questions are answered in the film, but whereas with 7624, 7625 and 7626 I could at least picture a story myself (eg with River Chase is fairly obvious what's happening - a chase down a river with a croc and a communist staking them out)!, the Temple set is a little all over the place. The design feels a little off to me - not really bad but not really great either. PROS: On the plus side, the natives and crystal skulls themselves are great. At 900+ pieces, this is also a great parts pack for dark tan, dark red, plant pieces, gold oddments etc. I especially love the baseplate in that shade. I like the overall shape of the temple - a big staircase with secret nooks and crannies. The build is reasonably interesting and there are some clever tricks with the traps. But upon reflection I shouldn't have to sell this set - it should be able to sell itself! As I said before, I'm a huge fan of dark, mysterious old temples so for that I have to give it some love. It reminds me of the big old Adventurers sets and the whiff of nostalgia is itself a powerful intoxicant. However, for the price Lego is selling it in Australia/ Europe/ Canada I couldn't recommend it as a must-buy for full price when the smaller sets in this series are themselves so good.

I've been wanting to see this set in detail since it debuted at the conventions. I have to say that, on the one hand, I agree that the minifigures, the crystal skulls, and the colors are great (I even like the waterfall), but, on the other, I kind of think that the set itself is a disappointment. It looks like they tried to accommodate design and playability needs, but really didn't come through on either. So, as you pointed out, the mid section doesn't really fit in with the other parts, and the trap sequence doesn't really flow, either. But, perhaps your right, and all will be answered in the film. I was surprised at just how empty the temple looked in the photo taken from above. They really should have gone the extra mile and made the temple look more like a temple, and not worry so much about the action features. Eh, but so it goes. But, I, too, am a sucker for tombs and temples, so I won't be able to pass it up. Archaeology on!"

Great review! Now I'm really truly convinced that I'm gonna buy this set. My faith was a little wobbly, but its benn restored Anyway, I just wanted to point out that the temple's entrance might actually be the turret thing. If you watch the teaser, there are some very similair stone pillars surrounded by sand (there are 4 not 2 though ) and when they close up it looks like all our characters are sucked into the sand and magically appear underground going through some stone plates(which act like steps to go down) that dissapear. So, in theory those steps beneath the turret are actualy the entrance, and I'm asumming from this picture That the steps with 1x8 bricks with the dragon heads at the end lead us of somewhere else. All in all this temple looks like a mixed up version of the real temple, which is fine by me (SIDENOTE: I'm not sure but based on minifig inclusion, either Lego was cheap or Colonel Dovchenko is dead by the time Irina and her goons reach the temple, I'll wait till I see the movie. ) Edited by Belloq, 02 May 2008 - 02:14 AM."

This is my first review of a set ever, don't be too mean. 1) Box It captures the potential (I don't know how the scene plays out... for now ) action of the scene nicely and is very pleasing, good job TLC . On the back it shows some of the play features of the set and a net little comic. Indiana Jones seems to be surprisingly calm considering that he is about to be captured under a net and attacked by a snake (the thing he fears most). 1a) comic not much to say on this... 1b) screw up At the top of the box, both ""Russian Guards"" have the same grining face, in the set one has the generic bad guy face from 7620. 2) Contents The box opens up to reveal a quartet of bags, an un-crumpled manual (YAY!), and a sticker sheet (BOO!) 2a) DSS Yoda said every for of rambling imaginable about this accursed item, I have nothing to say. Meh... 3) Minifigs The only thing that has not really been discussed about the figs that you get in this set is that Marion has a slightly new torso. 4) Parts of interest When I opened up the baggies, these were the components that grabbed my attention. A DARK GREEN alligator, a net piece that I Know has appeared in sets before hand ( I needed it for a MOC I am working on), some raft part that is probably very old, a ladder with two pairs of hindges, and a DARK brown version of this part. 4) Build (amphibious vehicle) This I one of the more enjoyable builds of the new line. But that is just my opinion. You start of with some thing very simple... By the end of the next page, it starts to bulk up More detail... Beginning to look like a car... 4a) Build (rear attachment) Bulk it up and add Taillights... Done... Slap it on to the main vehicle... 4b) Build (Front attachment) I am running out of things to say... Bulk it up... Add some detail... Add a gun and headlights... And attach to the rest to get the completed vehicle... Add stickers... I honestly think that the amphibious vehicle looks much better with the stickers than without... 5) Build (boat) This build goes by rather quickly and adds to the playability of the final set. Base... Apply clamps... Add more to engine... Build more detail and a gun base... Finished boat... Plus stickers... I love how Lego slips in the product number into their stickers. 6) Build (tree fort) This is the weakest part of the whole set. But I find my self liking it more and more for some odd and inexplicable reason. That tan 6x6 will most likely see use in a pirate themed vinigete soon (not mine ). Install net-launcher... You spend the next two pages building this... And putting it on... A tree branch that is an ugly mix of brown, dark brown, and frown... (our commie friend seems to like coffee a lot) Second branch... 3rd... (a wee bit to much on the coffee there, don't you think?) Final step... The only redeeming value of this section is how well the net launcher works, fantastically. The rest is just utter fail. 7) Spare parts Very little in terms of what is left over... Finished set... All in all, this set is a fine build and an excellent parts pack for dark green components. I recommend this set strongly, despite its few weaknesses."

I bought this set and Jungle Duel at Target the other day (I was going to wait and buy them when I go to Downtown Disney this summer, but how could I pass up saving four bucks that I can spend on store-exclusives? ) and I have to say I absolutely love them. The amphibious vehicle (don't they call it a Duck in the movie?) is definitely my favorite LEGO vehicle I've ever built. Everything about it is wonderful- the size, the colour scheme, and it's accurate to the one in the movie. And Irina Spalko's hair is to die for. On a side note, I don't get why they made Marion's arms white in the set. The shirt underneath her vest in the movie is obviously blue. I switched the arms out for light blue ones and it looks a lot better, and it makes Marion's eyes look great. -Ryan"

Number of pieces: unknown Release Year: 1988 Starting with the beautiful old Legoland box: Front: Back, with some cool alternative models: Inside: We continue with the great minifigs, which are not less than 13!

Of course we have a doc, if there is some kind of accident: The pit stop boxes, i love the small tool-holder with the axle and wheel behind it: The control room high above the racetrack: Ready to go?!!

You have reviewed my most favourite town set of all times, I am so happy to own this one. I actually is a story to go along with it: In the summer of 1998 I went on holiday with my parents to the country of Luxembourg, in the city of Wiltz we encountered a small toystore which still had this set for sale, (9 years after the release!). I did not had the sufficient amount of money to buy the set and had to leave it at the store, I was practically in tears... Four years later we passed through Luxembourg and I remembered the city and the store. We made a detour and stopped by the same store. Every other old set was sold, the only one remaining was this one! I bought it immediately and treasured it ever since. I use the baseplates a lot in my cities, they serve well as roads with parking spaces next to them. This was the first set I owned which had the huge 6x24 plates in them, I remember my surprise when seeing plates of such enourmous lenght... I recently made an entire racetrack together with this set and to promote myself I will place a link HERE"

Furthermore, this set offers 4 race cars and 13 mini-figures In addition, if town collectors remember, the car number tiles are printed instead of using stickers.

Up for review today is 8160 Cruncher Block and Racer X as part of Batbrick and iamded reviews: Here is the box, I have to say I love the art on it. It's very colourful and makes the truck look a lot less crap than it does on the box. Plus, you have to love the ""Missile launching action"" bit right, am I right? Why are you all staring at me? And here is the back. Pretty generic, but shows some nice details and so forth. Oh dear! In turning around the box have I killed myself AND iamded!? Okey dokey, up first is the best part of the entire set: the minifigs! Racer X is wonderful, though coming with a boring Bruce Wayne face. But it is Cruncher Block, his lady Driver Taejo that really shine. Look at those awesome suits! The cool faces! Taejo has a ripped shirt! Now up is the first building part of the set, with me and iamded looking rather slick in X's car. While I'm not a big fan of yellow, it is very nice, and slopes in an underused colour is better than no slopes at all: Front view, the new windshields are fantastic: While a very cool car, it is rather silly of TLC to give us the exact same one we got in the smaller set. I didn't get the smaller set with this car, so I'm still happy, but it is a bad marketing move: Sorry iamded, I know it's your birthday, but......VROOM! Now for the second part of the build and my favourite, the front of the truck: Annoyingly enough, this part opens up to shoot a pointless rubber projectile: To do this, you open the roof (a nice detail btw) and pull back the mechanism, here: Thus blowing the front part open and launching it.....well, not far really The wheels and covers are pretty cool, and the front is nicely designed, the red looks good and the rear vision mirrors are a great touch. And now for the most disappointing part - step three, the trailer: (Note - Clicky joint piece not part of set, just used to hold it up!) That's right, almost the entire thing is open, even the ""filled in"" side has holes! I'd certainly be cared to be back there, one bumpy hill and back you go! I didn't put the lame computer stickers on, and the control area is pretty lame in general. Not to mention Taejo (who is depicted on the boxart as standing at the desk, would most likely just be sucked out the back at those speeds! There are some pluses too though, like the ridiculously awesome minifig paintings I'll be using for Wayne Manor. Also note the ""control"" on Cruncher's desk that when turned, turns the gun at the bottom. It's an alright feature: Here is an example, I've shot iamded on his birthday. What? It's a love ray! Haven't you seen the Care Bears? And though I'm not a massive fan of stickers, this is just too cool. The little aquarium is very simple but very clever, using a printed piece between two clear windows to create the illusion of a tank: It looks much better in real life, trust me, and here is a side view to better explain: Now, to connect the two is a good thing, I like the way a simple technic piece assumes the job. Oh, and behold my hand! The completed truck, which, while a mixed bag, still doesn't look too bad (I guess): Now the completed set, which, despite its unbelievable large flaws, still looks cool. (Warning, the kickass iamded and Batbrick figures do not come with this set): More pics here: http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=3147324 All in all: Minifigs: 5/5 - Racer X is beautiful, Cruncher Block and the Driver too, and Taejo has a ripped shirt, damn! Design: 2/5 - Pretty poor considering the best part is available in a cheaper set, and only the front part of the truck looks cool, but still not truly awful. Build: 3/5 - Despite having a bad trailer, it was a fun build and sometimes you need something that doesn't take ages to make. Price: 2/5 - Overpriced easily, but Rogue Shadow is worse! Fun: 3/5 - The mere concept of such an open truck kept me playing with this baby for hours! Total: 15/25, not as bad as it would seem. Overall I'm really glad I bought it as the minifigs are fantastic and the paintings and fish tank are cool. It's fun, stupid and downright ridiculous, but while not a great set by any means, certainly isn't as bad in the brick as it looks in photos. Until next time, Batbrick Away!

I don't see any appeal at all really in this set, but that's okay, as I want to stick to Castle anyway. The car is the best part IMO, which you can get in a different set with another cool car and for a cheaper price. But the main downfall to this set is the fact that the truck's trailer is half blown up and the survivors are magically staying inside and not being sucked right out of there, as you have mentioned. I would have thought TLC would at least included some sort of cover that you could take on and off easily (kind of like the modular buildings). Having said all that though, the front of the truck does look incredibly cool, and those minifigs are sweet. Too bad they all have flesh tone printed on them. So, while this may not be my set of choice, I can see the appeal... well, really I can't, but it's just my opinion! I'm sure there are plenty others who would love to scoop this set up. ~Peace"

If you haven't yet seen the movie and want it to be a complete surprise, do not read. Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: But it is Cruncher Block, his lady Driver Taejo that really shine. Look at those awesome suits! The cool faces! Taejo has a ripped shirt! I was originally skepitcal about the driver figure—I like the head, but I was trying to figure out why they put in a female minifig with no hairpiece. After having seen the movie, I now understand why; Cruncher's driver is a fairly manly looking woman, and most of the LEGO hairpeices would make the minifig look too girly for the character. :) Now that I know why Taejo's shirt is ripped up I don't mind the bits of fleshie color that are printed on it, but I do wish they would make some of the new torsos a little more head-colour agnostic...there's no real reason why Cruncher and his driver couldn't have had ties that came all the way up to their necks instead of having those little wedges of flesh showing through loose collars. Yeah, they are low-level mafioso type scum, but they aren't complete slobs. Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: Front view, the new windshields are fantastic: They are indeed very nice, it's the main reason I started looking at the Speed Racer sets in the first place. Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: While a very cool car, it is rather silly of TLC to give us the exact same one we got in the smaller set. I didn't get the smaller set with this car, so I'm still happy, but it is a bad marketing move: I think the error they made was in the smaller set though. In the movie, the only time we see Cruncher's semi is when he's being chased by Racer X. Racer X and Taejo do end up on the same team for a cross country rally race (along with Speed of course), so I guess that's where they were going by putting those two together in the smaller set, but it would have been much more interesting for them to have made up a set with Taejo and one of the cars from the very goofy, comic book-gimmicky teams they are racing against. Especially since one of the teams (that is chasing Taejo specifically) is a bunch of Army-wannabee loonies—I'm sure more people would have loved some sort of dark/sand green racer with one of the IJ Soviets at the wheel than another Racer X. To summarize: Two Racer X's is bad, but it is the smaller set that should have been changed (imho). Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: Annoyingly enough, this part opens up to shoot a pointless rubber projectile: Thus blowing the front part open and launching it.....well, not far really As much as I normally don't like the stupid techic launcher thing, and would rather not see it in a set ever again (although one of these days I will make a giant multi-launcer rig out of them just for fun), at least there is a reason for it to be in this set, as Cruncher's semi has a missile launcher in the front end of it in the movie. I think you're supposed to lift the panel that hides the missile before launching it, similar to the way that panels slide out of the way on the semi cab to allow for firing in the movie. Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: And now for the most disappointing part - step three, the trailer: That's right, almost the entire thing is open, even the ""filled in"" side has holes! I'd certainly be cared to be back there, one bumpy hill and back you go I'm gonna chock this up to the standard LEGO philosophy of ""playset"" rather than ""model"" design for a lot of things. The semi rig and Raver X's car are the models, the trailer is the playset. Seeing as how the trailer is Cruncher's mobile office (rather finely appointed with lots of paintings and his pirahna ""babies"" in their tank behind his desk), and the intent seems more or less to have a playest bit in order for kids to re-enact the scene from the movie, I'm not going to give them too much grief over this. They tried to capture the basic bits of the movie set (which we see mostly from the inside during the movie) and translate it into a playset type environment. That being said, I do wish the back walls were more solid, as I see no reason for there to be gaps in the back wall when the front wall (or the ""fourth wall"" as the case may be here) is already conspicously absent. Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: There are some pluses too though, like the ridiculously awesome minifig paintings I'll be using for Wayne Manor. Also note the ""control"" on Cruncher's desk that when turned, turns the gun at the bottom. It's an alright feature: Could have been a little better, but it's such a minor bit of this scene in the movie that I can see why they didn't spend too much time and effort on it. It would have been nice to have more paintings though, had the back wall been more complete (and I like your idea of how to use them :) ). Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: And though I'm not a massive fan of stickers, this is just too cool. The little aquarium is very simple but very clever, using a printed piece between two clear windows to create the illusion of a tank: Definately a feature which is not showcased nearly well enough on the box art. Since it is one of the major features of this set in the movie, it's nice to see it translate rather well into brick. Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: Design: 2/5 - Pretty poor considering the best part is available in a cheaper set, and only the front part of the truck looks cool, but still not truly awful. That may be a bit harsh (but not much) given what I've said further up this post, but it probably only deserves a 3 at best, so I'm not realy going to quibble the point. :) I still think that Racer X should be exclusive to this set and a different car should be in the smaller set with Taejo, which would have improved the cachet for this set overall. Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: Price: 2/5 - Overpriced easily, but Rogue Shadow is worse! True...this should have ideally been about a $30 set (especially given the general awesomeness of the IJ Race for the Stolen Treasure set), unless they made the trailer a bit more detailed (better back wall, perhaps some drop down gun ports like in the movie) or at put least one (or more) of Cruncher's goons in the set, then maybe I could agree more with the msrp. On that note: if I remember correctly from my visit to my local TRU yesterday in search of the new IJ sets (since local Targets seem determined not to get them in stock yet), they had this set on sale for around $35 along with an offer for a coupon good for $7.50 towards the purchase of a ticket to the movie with any Speed Racer toy purchase over $25. I may be wrong on the sale price, but I know the ticket offer was there. So, if you haven't seen the movie yet, and are interested in this set, TRU may be the place to go right now to get both at a slightly cheaper price. Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: Fun: 4/5 - The mere concept of such an open truck kept me playing with this baby for hours! So you did enjoy the playest aspect of the trailer, even though you didn't care for the design...looks like they didn't do too badly then on what they wanted out of that bit. :) Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: Overall I'm really glad I bought it as the minifigs are fantastic and the paintings and fish tank are cool.

Your review has definately added an additional impetus to that notion. My pocketbook (does not) thank you!"

Some cool fleshie heads and parts, but it does seem a bit lamer even than I imagined from the box (the ""airy"" truck is rather slyly disguised on the box art). I would like to get it if it is ever on sale, 50% off would be nice :) Speed Racer Lego doesn't seem to be selling too well in local shops here."

I actually think this kit is really very nice for the size. True, you only get three figures, but it seems that's a norm in most batman sets. Besides, everything else is great. The tumbler looks like an amazing build - they really nailed this tank of a ride. And the Ice cream truck... Plus, this set does seem to have some neat pieces in it (trans green popsicles and lime hubcaps, anyone?). I think this far beats the rest of the batman lineup this year, which seems quite disapointing overall. Edited by Grevious, 16 May 2008 - 08:12 PM."

I really love this set, sure the figs are annoyingly not new, but the ice cream truck is fantastic and the Tumbler is a marvel of black slopes. I see now that it is far too huge though, I reckon I will either keep it that way as a ""mega tumbler"", mod it to become another Battank, keep it as a model Tumbler, or pull it apart and use the bits to make a Tumbler like Wetwire's awesome one. Love those popsicles though, and those wheels are very nice, so overall as a loyal Batfan I love the set, even though it could've been better. Batbrick Away!"

The latest offering from our favorite building toy company is none other than the infamous General Grievous! No doubt you all know the story of Grievous; two parts Technic and one part human and his hatred of the Jedi. Follow along as we get a close-up view of the mighty General. No doubt the observant will wonder why I purchased this set from Shop @ Home instead of my trusty LEGO store in Glendale. Well, it’s really as simple as two things: I’ve been traveling a lot and didn’t have time to drive to the store to get it AND gas is now $4/gallon and I would likely spend more in gas than the $9 shipping cost to get it to me. So there you have it. The Box: A gigantic box (much larger than expected) held the mighty General. We’re back to the perforated tabs on the side and two stickers on the front that let the box lift open: Inside, we have 17 bags, two manuals and three stickers on a relatively small sticker sheet. The Manuals: The manuals are not terribly thick in fact the second manual is noticeably thinner than the first. They come in at 75 and 31pages. Interesting to note on the back we see the next (and more interesting) wave of sets later this summer. Nothing new to report on the manuals as they provide the LEGO standard of high quality and features we expect. - Piece callouts - Models divided into sections - Large images - Page numbers Since there were links posted to the .pdf files of the instructions online, I’m sure you can all get an idea of the manual and the parts inventory. However, for those of you without access to the Internet here are photos of the parts inventory pages: Random manual image: Features page: The Pieces: The short answer is you get lots and lots of little pieces in white, gray and black plus some big pieces in white, gray and black. Mixed in the set is a fair amount of oddball pieces like minifig tools, Jedi hood and trans yellow dome. Fear not, despite the eclectic collection of parts, it all comes together in the end (not unlike a typical day at work for me…) It is probably worth noting again that there is a heavy amount of Technic parts and pieces here. The Build: The build starts off with a rather in-depth build of the stand in which General Grievous stands on. Once you think you are done, you keep adding on to this (rather solid) base. I bet there are 250 pieces just in the base alone! It is quite nice when you get done with it though and really adds to the display. I’m glad LEGO didn’t skimp on the base as it completes the model. Once you get through all that, the rest of the build is a real thumb-bruiser. Anyone who has built a decent size Technic set knows the feeling of your thumbs being sore when you are done. You get the same effect here. It is actually a fun build and I really liked seeing how the designers used all the various pieces to recreate a fairly accurate model of Grievous. The model is built from the ground up as seen in a few of the progress shots: Here is what is left over: The Design: The design is quite good and is very accurate. Some might be disappointed that since this is a Technic set we don’t have more articulation in the shoulders and have the ability to separate two arms into four as seen in the movie. However, it would seem the real intent is for display and not functionality. Here is a shot of the torso and the detail involved: Here are Grievous’ organs: Careful observers will note that my model is lacking two “arrow” stickers from the two white chest pieces. I failed to see these on the sticker sheet and only grabbed the large Grievous sticker. So, note that there are actually THREE stickers and not ONE. Chest protector and respirator: Head and arms: I was a little disappointed that we got two yellow blades and no green blades on the lightsabers. Note how all the lightsabers have different hilts which is a nice touch: Here are some shots of the completed model with a few other sets shown for scale. He is actually pretty tall: You have the option to remove the top two arms and put in shoulder plates if you so desire: Detail on the back: Overall Thoughts: I’ve been saying for a few years that we should have a Technic Grievous set and we finally got one. Designed more as a model and not a fully functional swooshable figure, Grievous is a tad flimsy. You won’t want him to veer too far off his massive and sturdy base. It would have been nice to have is cape with him (like the Technic Vader set). I do like the size of the model and it is impressive to look at. LEGO Star Wars System fans will likely want to think twice before purchasing but Technic and UCS fans should be satisfied. Final Rating: 75% Build 8/10 (Very Good – Fun, relatively quick build. Technic fans will be more pleased than others.) Design 8/10 (Very Good – Some nice SNOT and Technic techniques. A bit flimsy but the base is kind of cool.) Parts 7/10 (A mixed bag of stuff. Probably can’t get too many diverse builds from this except for other robot type models.) Price 7/10 (Just OK – A bit stiff at $90 USD for a nice display model with limited functionality.) As always, let’s hear your thoughts and feedback."

I love this year's Mars Mission line, and though this is the weakest set, it is still a major improvement. The mech is very cool and well made, and the Commander is one of my favourite alien figs ever. The alien ship is pretty good, better than last years ones but not extremely good either, but i still like the set. Batbrick Away!"

That really is a neat little set, that walker is fantastic, most likely the best part of the set. Though the alien craft does also look neat, and it's cool how it can fold down into aa walker. Or rather, a sentry turret, seeing as it can't really move while in that mode. Still, it's nice. My favourite part is the mini mining robot though. So cute! ~Peace"

The alien fighter looks pretty nice, nothing special but streamlined and fast nevertheless. That transforming feature´s a nice addition for sure, and these new flicker missile with its launch apparatus.... hmm, I hope I won´t spend quite some time in search of that little 'rocket' piece.... However, there´s still something I miss with these alien crafts.... I don´t know.... I like some more organic looking design, and they even come in some nice and different shapes, but still.... perhaps a real space fighter just needs a solid cockpit, cool windscreens and controls to satisfy my odd likings. That 'exo suit' looks really good and I wonder why it´s a little underrepresented on the box art. The jet pack/space scooter´s a really good idea, and the only thing I hate´re those darned studless technic beams.... it could look so much better with a studded version of these parts. But of course that´s only due to my personal preferences."

When walked into my Toys 'R' Us in Fullerton, CA, just to buy a simple Tiny Turbo racer, what do I see? All the Agents sets sitting on the shelf, ready for the taking! I didn't have too much money with me, so I just got 2 of 8631 Mission 1: Jetpack Pursuit! It's a really cool little set, so I thought I'd review this puppy for you! I shall proceed in the order of the instructions. So, let's get started! The Minifigs Let's begin with the minifigs, Saw Fist and Agent Chase! They are really cool, some of the coolest minifigs I have seen in a while! I took off Saw Fist's wig & chainsaw so you can see his head and cybernetic arm better! Here is a back view of Saw Fist, and - SURPRISE! Agent Chase has a double sided head! One side with his cool ""mission face"" with sunglasses and headset, and one with his casual Bruce Wayne type face (note, though, that it is not really the Bruce Wayne face). His wig, btw, is Mutt's hairpiece in black! Very neat! Poor Saw Fist seems to be forced to always drag his chainsaw around for it is way too long to just hang down from his shoulder like a normal arm. The Snowmobile Next up, we have the snowmobile, a sleek little vehicle with only minor design flaws! The container with the jewel is attached to the vehicle by a single stud, so it doesn't fall off, but is easy to pick up! In the pic below you can see the only two tiny design flaws: Thanks to the exhaust pipes, the laser cannon (or whatever it's supposed to be) can't be lowered any further than this. Also, the corners of that slope-ish piece that the handle bar rests on are sticking out a little at the sides. Other than that, it's pretty well done! The Jetpack Finally, there is the Jetpack! IMO, a name like Autogyro-pack or something would make more sense, but whatever. Although a little bulky, the Jetpack is very well designed! The rotor can be tilted back, and at the lower back of the Jetpack, there is hook with which you can grab the container with the jewel from the snowmobile. What I like best about the Jetpack is that although it is attached to the minifig in kinda the same way as that of the Riddler, this one doesn't rotate around. So, the Agent is being held in place steadily! ""See ya later, chainsaw-cyborg-dude!"" Stickers This set comes with a surprisingly large sticker sheet. The reason is that half of it are extra stickers! There are two large Agents logos and one Inferno logo - perfect for Agents MOCs! There are also a star and a small, round sticker portraying the number of the mission. The star seems to be part of some kind of game where you collect the stars from all sets on an Agents ID that you get from the Mission 5 set. I don't know, though, if you get any gain from this except for becoming a full-status Lego Agent! Below, you can find the list of parts from this set! Click here for a better quality pic! That's pretty much it! I hope you liked this review and will run straight to your next toy store to get one or more of this set! This was my very first set review! So any questions, comments, or requests? Any more pics you want me to take? Would you like me to exchange the chainsaw with something else, or do you want me to try the Agent's new hairpiece out on another fig? If so, just tell me! See ya!

Judging by this set, the line is going to be promising. I really like the figs and I'm glad to see that robot arm is actually a new arm mold. Awesome!! Can a minifig hand fit in the end or just the chainsaw attachment? Could it fit an Exo-Force robot claw? There's a lot of detail in the torsos and I like that the Agent's suit is like a moto-cross uniform. I love that the snowmobile has a working tread. Copmike, Ras and I tried to build a snowmobile with working treads, but we ended up using chainsaw blades in the end. Great work Oky!"

I think the jet pack if far to bulky it could do with some minimising but that’s life. I assume that you can’t fit a standard hand in the chainsaw arms are the hole would be to large but would you be so good as to confirm this for me? Overall I quite like the jet ski and the ability to lower the arms to much doesn’t both me. How much was it just so I can get an idea of the price? Finally thanks for posting this review so quickly.

The two sided head is nice, although it would've been nice if it was a new head rather than the standard frowning face. The cyborg looks good, nice and cartoony, I like the printing on his back. The belt on the hips should be useful, not to mention the robotic hand. I assume that anything that fits into a 1x1x1 cylinder can fit in it? I hope so Thanks again Oky.

Now to answer your questions: The robot arm can fit EF robot claws and anything that a minifig can hold in his hand or that would fit into a 1x1x1 cylinder, so normal minifig hands are too small to fit. TLG is using the robot claw idea for the main villain of the Agents line! Do you still want me to try it out and take pics? The price was 10.99 USD at the TRU I bought it at. I bet it'ss be a dollar less on S@H! And I'm sorry, but I probably won't get any more sets any time soon. I have to save my money for all the other good set that are to come.

I really have mixed feelings towards Agents set. Haha, but I love the Agent mini-figure. The double-sided face is great and I love the sunglass look.

Yeah and it's all over this years releases. From what I've seen so far it's found in: racers, Speed Racers, Mars Mission and Exo-Force sets. I just wish that instead of a 2x1 plate with an exhaustpipe in each end they would have made it an 1x1 plate with a single exhaust. That would have been a lot more useful."

It's even possible to fill out their numbers with Exo-force grunts of the same color) I'm not that hot for the agent himself, his uniform... nah. It doesn't even look like clothes, just give the man a suit or some nifty leather. I think I'll try to grab some sets from the agents line just for the new parts (to begin with... MOCs may follow, who knows?) when they are available in stores here in Sweden. Haven't seen them yet, though Indiana Jones just got here so there might be some further waiting for me.

The main components of the set are the jet, the truck and trailer, and the three Minifigs; Gold Tooth, an Inferno Henchman, and Agent Fuse. Fuse is your basic jet pilot-looking guy, but he does come with one of those handy double-printed faces with smiley look an a scared look. The Henchman is your basic LEGO criminal with an Inferno uniform, and Gold Tooth is the perfect example of a super-villain with his gold hair, gold teeth, gold piercings, and golden gun (Auric Goldfinger meets Saramanga?) The Inferno Jeep is a nice, quick build with cool rubberized shocks and a slick, almost futuristic design. The black and orange colors work really well together and the swiveling back seat for the Henchman and his huge pistols is a nice touch. The fact that the trailer hauling the gold bricks and target gimmick is a separate piece instead of a bed assembly on the jeep is great because it allows the Jeep to stand on it's own without the cargo or gimmick. The best part of the set, however, is the Agents jet. It's small and uncomplicated, but it's very cool and very satisfying. The large cockpit on the smaller body is sort of reminiscent of old GI Joe jet toys. The air intakes on the bottom are made with the ever-popular SNOT building technique which is sure to please many. But just the sheer swooshability of the jet and it's compact sweetness is reason enough to get this set. Heck, I'm already considering getting a few more and swapping the dark blue on the jet out for other colors so I can have a small, multi-colored fleet of the things. The abundant stickers might turn some people off, but the level of detail they add to the jet is worth the hassle. Man, I really wish LEGO would do more modern-style military-type vehicles like this, because it is full of win. I'd wholeheartedly recommend this set to all LEGO vehicle fans, and I also believe that really any LEGO fan would like this set. I can only give it a score of out of 5"

Not as good as a mechanical assembly or something with springs, but it does okay. I don't think it'd harm the look of the Jeep to lower it at all. And I picked it up for $31 US...but this was at Toys R Us, so I think it'll be $30 pretty much everywhere else."

I mean, yeah, so I like all the Agents sets, but still the point stands. The plane is great, and would probably stand well on it's own. That then makes the jeep a welcome addition. Fuse is really cool, especially the scared head which looks brilliant. Gold Tooth (nice and subtle) is pretty cool as well, in a campy sort of way. In fact, that's something I like in the whole line. It's a bit camp (in a spy-fest sort of way). I'm not sure whose idea it was to put the gold haul on a rickety trailer, where it's likely to fall off. Because I hope Dr Inferno has harsh words with them!"

A hose nozzle is hardly a gun, not even plated with gold. Well, I guess it's all about mocing now... The jet is just ok for me. My guess was right, the afterburner is a barrel, and, for me, it looks just like a barrel stuck to the tale. That canopy is even worse then it seemed from other angles, too. But with some heavy modifications, it still has potential. O the more positive note, I love the colour scheme, and the jeep is much better looking and design then I expected."

The other 2 big sets belong to Lord Santos. Warning: There is a SHITLOAD of pictures! And here we go! Set Nr.: 7737 Name: Coast Guard 4WD Number of minifigs: 1 Number of pieces: unknown Release Year: 2008 First of all (surprise surprise..) the Box & Instructions: Front: Back: Instructions: The Minifig (i love that torso): General Overview of the Set (notice the NEW tyres!): The Car alone: The trailer with the neat little Boat: The equiqment holder: The boat alone, and i must say this is designed great, looks really like a little scooter: The trailer, nothing too special here: Summary: I just got that set, but i love it! I really like these new cars, cause they are much more real looking, except maybe of the missing doors, but that can be fixed with a little bit mocing in this case. If you see it, buy it. You won't be disappointed. That's all i can say! We go on with the Coast Guard Truck, which is my absolutely Nr. 1 of the new sets. Let the Pictures speak for themselves! Set Nr.: 7726 Name: Coast Guard Truck & Speedboat Number of minifigs: 2 Number of pieces: unknown Release Year: 2008 As could it be something different, first of all the box & instructions again: Front: Back: We got 2 sets of instructions here, first one for the Boat & equipment thingy, second one for the rest: The minifigs: General overview: The truck & equipment thing alone: A different view of the truck: The first detail i really like at that set, the thing that holds the diving and kinda radar-equipment: The trailer with the boat on it: The trailer alone: ..and the boat alone: Now that is something i think could have been made better, or say, put at least SOMETHING in it, the storage room in the stern of the boat. Though it's got plenty of room and you can put in anything you like: The next detail i love are the motors of the boat, the're really well-designed and you can even move them sideways or pull 'em up if they're not needed: The wench on the trailer to pull the boat on it or load it off to the water: And last but not least, the cockpit of the truck, nothing too special but i really like that the did put the black slope brick screen in it: That was it folks, quite a few pictures, huh? Summary: Just one word: BUY. As i said this is my favourite of the new sets, and if i was i child i think i could play hours and hours with it, as it's got great plaability and isn't really fragile or something. Hope you enjoyed the Review, LEGO City & Coast Guard on!"

The little buggy´s really well (I still want car doors! ) done, especially since it´s size isn´t quite that big like with the other CG crafts. And although that big truck´s indeed, ahem, big, I don´t mind at all. I just love that unimoginess of it.... well, that´s no real word, nevermind....

As what Sinner had said, this is a very good way to get Mr Freeze without getting the Batcave. And it so happened that, I do not have the Batcave too.

I know, I know - it's a small set with crappy tiny vehicles; so it probably sucks for the fan who likes to display sets; but look at the MOCing side and you see this set has a ton of potential: -New Batman fig. Well, mainly the torso; but it looks nice, sleek, and armored! A definite plus whether you're a MOCist or batfan. -Mr. Freeze. Because nobody bought the Batcave when they should have...and by nobody I mean me. Plus, I love that head! -Cheapest way to amass the lightning piece. The other sets that have it are lolhueg (Well, not really, but I don't have $50 to toss around on a little skeleton tower...), and it's a great piece. -Two little blue gems. I may be alone on this, but those are my favorite parts (the gems), and that's my favorite color for them! <3 <3 <3 -Several other useful parts, including a +O piece in black, some light/medium blue bits from Mr. Freeze's kart, the oddly placed grappling hook, and some cheap wheels. Now, I don't know about you guys, but this is as close to a Batman Battlepack as we're going to get, lol - I'm buying at least three, maybe more once I get my summer job ^.^ (Oh, and the fact that the US price is only $10 helps a little, but this year you guys can't complain - you got practically every set first, ESPECIALLY the new castle!

Apart from the figs, it is very crappy. Mr Freeze's buggy is OK but the bat buggy is easily the worst vehicle I've seen for years. Colours are all over the place, the grappling hook feels cheaply made, the inclusion of those odd pearl silver parts which have been in the Exo-Force sets seem especially random here, the terrible Bionicle flame piece... It's the first Lego vehicle I've built where I've immediately had the urge to disassemble it and pretend I never bought it! Really, I only got it for Mr Freeze so I shouldn't complain. But still. It's a real step backwards. The comparable Catwoman dragster set was heaps better. The Penguin sub is sweet though Thanks for the review anyway!"

A big box with a helicopter, car, and gate in it. Seems like a winner, but how good is it really, and is it worth the cash? Let's start with the Minifigs. This set comes with a standard Inferno Henchman, Spy Clops, and Agent Chase. The Henchman is you basic LEGO criminal type with a gun and a jumpsuit, nothing real groundbreaking here. Spy Clops, on the other hand, is very cool for, technically, half of a Minifig. His head has a neat electronic goggle print and the rest of him is a torso mounted onto a set of six legs made from Exo-Force robot arms. The whole thing is really well done and neat as hell. Agent Chase (Turbo Car Chase! ) seems to have a standard agent body and a double-printed face with one side a sunglasses and headset print. The other face is a determined Agent look. The set also includes a laptop with Doctor Inferno wallpaper. The laptop is a new piece and works like the LEGO books that are in a lot of Harry Potter sets. Molding on the keyboard is really well done and the thing can be held by a Minifig along either corner, but not in the middle and not while closed. The gate in the set is nothing revolutionary by itself, and I sort of get the feeling that it was included to drive up the piece count and the set price point. That being said, there are some things to like here. For instance, the gate has four wheels of barbed wire attached to it. The barbed wire is new and makes me want to start building some World War I trench MOCs. The rest of the gate is fairly big and it has a handy ramp attached so that vehicles can roll through it easily. The main feature of the gate is a sound brick. It's much better then LEGO sound and light units of the past, when the gate is opened it depresses a button and an alert klaxon blares that sounds every bit like a prison-beak in progress. The triggering action works surprisingly well and it's pretty much for this feature alone that I'm not going to immediately break the gate back down and add it to my parts bin. The designers did make an effort to create more then just a fence though. A nice control panel connected to a big spotlight crowns the piece, and a pair of cameras watch the opening. It's really hard to mess up a LEGO helicopter, and this set is no exception. The Inferno Chopper is a nicely proportioned and well built machine. It looks properly menacing and has the uniform orange and black of other Inferno property. It's armed with a set of four Technic pegs cleverly used as guns on outriding mounts, as well as a pair of the newer-style flick-fire missiles. I personally don't care for flick-firing missiles, but these look decent enough and seem to stay put so I really can't complain about them. Along the fuselage are a pair of intake pieces that I've never seen before and I'm guessing are new. They're pretty well designed and will come in handy for MOCing down the road. The action feature of the aircraft is the wench system. This is very different then other LEGO wenches in that you build the entire mechanism and housing. You can then use it to raise Spy Clops up and down from the bottom of the chopper using the rotor. Now, this also keeps you from sitting there and just giving the rotor repeated spins to simulate flight. I'm not too thrilled with that, but there are a hundred other LEGO helicopters out there with fully rotating rotors, so I guess I can let it by just this once. As you'd suspect, the bottom of the cockpit is completely open, which makes this a vehicle pretty much solely for Spy Clops (Sorry Henchman). But there is plenty of room beneath the body to attach a plate with some seats on it to accommodate another pilot without drastically altering the design, or even removing existing pieces. The Turbo Car is a slick little honey of a LEGO car, and the silver pieces that make up the body work contribute a lot to that fact. The front license plate appears to be an Exo-Fore code brick. But it also hides the activation lever for the passenger ejector seat. The seat works about as well as the Spruce Goose, which is to say not well at all, but here it's the thought that counts. The interior of the car is really well done. There's even a radar screen for keeping track of pesky helicopters. But the Bond-like features don't end there. A lever in the compartment raises pair of guns in the hood and a knob on the rear deploys a quad rocket system with more flick-fire missiles. This is a car that won't be stopped easily! The rear has two cones sticking out. I'd like to think they're smoke nozzles or oil-slick sprayers. All-in-all, this is a really good set. The car is pure LEGO vehicle love and looks fantastic. The silver pieces are very nice and it's a shame LEGO doesn't use metallic colors in System sets more often. There are, however, a LOT of sticker for this set and I know how much that bugs a lot of people. I personally like how much detail the stickers add to these sets and don't mind them so much. The set also comes with an Agents ID card for Chase which you can put little star stickers on from other sets as you get them. It's printed on a real nice piece of sturdy plastiboard and would be cooler if you could put your own picture and name on it instead of pretending to be Chase. Sold by themselves, the car and chopper would be must-haves. All tossed together with the gate sort of makes the set a little less then the sum of it's parts. And with 498 parts (most of them small) that's not so hot. It's only slightly over-priced in my opinion, but if you do shell out the money you won't regret it. I'm very comfortable recommending this set to anyone. Close to perfect, but the price and some minor flaws bring it back just a little. I'd say 4.33, but out of 5 is close enough!"

I picked up this set earlier in the week and was quite pleased with it (in fact I have missions 1-5 and am happy with all of them - this series is much better than the old Alpha Team ever was). I look forward to reading your thoughts on it. I will say 2 things about it now though. 1)My set came with defective instructions. In 2 places pages are missing and duplicates of other pages repeated. For instance, the car instructions are missing steps 16-21. Fortunately, I was able to make out what pieces went where in the missing steps by studying the illustration in step 22. I hope you have better luck with your instructions. 2)This set contains the best LEGO sound brick ever (it's just begging to be incorporated into my Arkham Asylum)."

I can't wait to get this myself, but right now I gotta save for the CW sets! The car is with no doubt one of the most mind blowing things TLG has come up with and we can only hope that there will be more models made out of almost only metalic colors! The spider cyborg, while not as innovative as some of the other cyborgs, is a very nice fig, and his head will be very usefull for Splinter Cell MOCs! And those intake pieces are only relatively new btw, they are in almost all of the current $10 Racers sets. Any chance of you taking a pic of a line-up of all the silver parts in this set?

I love going back through the old ""Agents"" thread just to see how wrong we were about these awesome sets! I actually really like the gate, those portcullis pieces people may know i always find nice uses for, and I really, really, really want that awesome sound brick. The figs are a bit disappointing in numbers, but agent Chase is very cool, generic henchman are great, and Spy Clops is one of my favourite minifigs ever! The helicopter is wonderful too, I love that it is customised for Spy clops to winch him down. The colours as usual for these sets are fantastic, the dark blue, orange and chrome silver! The car is the best though, I love all the functions. How does the ejector seat work though? Batbrick away!"

The sound brick seems great, the helicopter looks very nice and the car is superb! All of the James Bond features are really cool, though I'm very interested in how the ejector seat works (or doesn't work..). The car itself is very sleek and full of beautiful silver, and the inclusion of the new rims and windshield mean that I won't have to buy many Speed Racer sets. As for the minifigs, they all look great, especially SpyClops. Though it looks rather easy for him to fall off of his spider legs. Can you confirm this? A great review of a great set, thanks Deinonychus"

The seat, in turn, is attached to the side of the car with a Technic pin. The result is, when the axle is pushed forward, the gray joint and beam tilt the seat and ""eject"" a Minifig.

This, I must say, is one of those sets! The only concern for me, like alot of others, is the price. I will just have to wait and see and continue to look at these photo's Deinonychus has provided for us!! So much for thinking the Agent line was going to be weak!

This time, I will be reviewing Skeleton Battlepack, and I hope everyone of you do enjoy viewing it. This was a request that put up by hollisbrick in the Castle thread. Initally, I thought it was a very simple set to do a review. However, for the love of Castle, I decided to whip this up for every Castle fan out there. This is an image of how the Skeleton Battlepacks look like. I have bought 12 last packs of these in total so far but none of the Crown battlepacks yet. There were snapped much faster, that I imagined. Do pardon me for the poor lightning. Today is a bad weather, it's hard to get natural light. The Skeleton Gang For a single battlepack like this, with an attractive reasonable price. You obtained a series of 5 skeleton mini-figs with tons and tons of useful castle accessories. To me, it's a very very great buy, and it's a MUST to stock up for my army building! Some add-ons! However, I was not very satisfied with my Skeleton armies standards. Therefore, I decided to make some slight modifications with some additional castle accessories that is stocked in my Castle warehouse. After the makeover, Ok, this is what I called a real skeleton army. This is mainly my opnion and it have to be aligned with my standards. I felt this improved battlepack gives a punch to the exisitng battlepack. The two soliders on the right, is able to align with the rest of my Castle Chess sets armies. While the one on the left, it gives me a great archer back up with the quiver and helmet attached to him. The ones, on the center especially the armored guard which equipped with the black nose cone helmet is my fave. It is able to illustrate the ""Elite"" among the rest of the guards with its armor and helmet which was featured in my Castle Deep Forest Expansion MOC.. Promotion On! In addition, the one which was hastly done with a modify mace, it looks rather simple. In time to come, I will change it and gives a better equipment and look. These are the remains. I can use the axe for my dwarf in my dwarf mine defender. In that set, there is no weapon for my dwarf and I have to get it from other sets. The rest of the accessories, makes a very good stock up for future upgrading! Overall: 9/10 This is not a playset. It is mainly bought for its abilty to mass recurit any armies, and is a main love for all Castle Army builders such as me! This set mainly have no major faults, and I love it so much. Although, I have done some slight modifciations, but this set is a must for me to buy more and more! Meanwhile, I will need to wait for the next shipment! Hope everyone have enjoying viewing this simple review of mine! Edited by WhiteFang, 25 May 2008 - 12:52 PM."

Was looking through the thread, then I realised there is a request for it. It was an unexpected shipment that send to Singapore. It came in very limited quantity. Most of the battlepacks were snapped within a day or two when it arrived. Well, I am thinking of building something big in the future. It's just a plan that I have not decided yet. For me, I always love to see the beauty of a big army with different battalions, forming a kingdom. That's why, I always buy many many sets that have figures that attracts me. And for this battlepack, it served a very good purpose for it!"

Yes, the price for the battlepacks is a little steep. However for the amount of mini-figs and castle accessories, the price and quantity justifiy my bulk purchase. This is one way to acquired soldiers without spending much money on other sets. In this way, you will save much more. I understand the concern of Star Wars Battlepacks from your country. But in my country, Star Wars battlepacks are priced much much higher than the Castle Battlepacks. Asuka, on May 26 2008, 01:38 AM, said: Thanks, WhiteFang! Castle Battle Packs.... simply wonderful!

Both these sets adds up to $18.00 (CAD) And the skeleton pack have the same price of $18.00 (CAD) *prices quoted from S@H I understand that 7009 and 7090 offers more pieces, horses and same amount of mini-figs compared to a typical battlepack. IMO, I feel that all 3 sets are all army building sets. 7009 offer small catapult, 3 mini-figs, a skeleton white horse. 7090 offer a joust divider, weapon rack (good accessories), 2 mini-figs, a horse with barding and a skeleton black horse. These sets have different purpose. For me, buying multiples of 7009 is to build its catapult, white skeleton calvaries. While 7090 is to build on Crown calvaries and Black skeleton calvaries. However, Battlepacks have a different agenda. It offered some castle accessories that is not available commonly. For a Castle army builder like myself, castle accessories are always in demand. The black robe, silver armor, silver short-axe are not very common castle accessories. It can be used as a good stock up too. I am not saying this battlepack is an one way solution to solve everything. That's why, different sets are released to target on different purposes."

The fact to the matter is with the battle pack you get: 5 minifigs with lots of accessories. While with the sets that sdpirate showed us you get: 5 minifigs with an okay amount of accessories 3 horses (including two skeleton ones) A ballista A weapons rack, and a jousting barricade. You cannot say that the battle pack contains the same amount of stuff that the other two sets have and therefore should be priced the same. It just seems that Lego is ripping off Canadian army builders, to me if the battle pack contained a small catapult, or wall so that it contained about the same amount of stuff that the other sets had it would be fair. It seems stupid that you will only get minifigs from one set, while you can get about the same amount of minifigs plus a bunch of other stuff from two other equally priced sets.

MacK, I can understand your concern when pricing is concerned. Pricing is always a big issue for us to determine whether to buy or not to buy a certain set in a particular country. Pricing varies differently across different countries such as US, Europe, Canada, Australia and etc. This is something very hard for us to decide on. We can't be sure why TLC placed their pricing strategies this way. Well, I think we should appericate what TLC is trying to do for us, by not using price as the only factor to judge whether to buy this set or not. At least, I am sure there are many of us trying to request for battlepacks to muster armies for their MOCs, Armies Collection and etc. Different people have different judgements towards different sets and different themes. I respect your opnion. IMO, let's don't let price be the only determined factor to decide whether to purchase a particular set or not. Instead, consider an array of factors that is offered. However, I do know that consumers like me and you are always affected by price. iamded, on May 26 2008, 01:40 PM, said: Thanks for the review Whitefang! Your additions look great, I like your mace much better than the use of a small technic cog, your looks much sturdier. And that helmet looks really great on skellie soldiers, I never thought to use that before. Very cool indeed! iamded, I am glad you enjoyed the review and my slight modifications. That mace was a much looking weapon. It looks much firm than the orignal look. The design was inspired from Dwarf Mine and Dwarf Mine Defender. I would not want to have so many troll flags hanging around. The nose cone helmet, was to give the soliders a whole new look. To me, it retains the classic look, yet it belongs to present theme, suitable for my Skeleton Elite Guards."

For me, I will use these battlepack for army building purpose. I always feel that every kingdom needs a considerable amount of soldiers to defend their kingdom. Therefore, most of the time, the amount of soldiers will dictate how strong that kingdom is in my collection. In the future, I hope to build large castle scenes, combined all playsets, armies everything together and developed a kingdom scene. Of course, that is just a dream for now. I am still currently not able to afford much space and time to do such big scale project at the moment. Meanwhile, for this great castle theme, I am storing them at the moment and take it out when the time is ripe. One day soon, I hope I can post an image or two of my armies.

As you all know, Indiana Jones IV has just debuted, and TLG has released a set depicting the Incan temple (7627) from the film's climax. But Lego beat Harrison Ford, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and company to the punch by nine whole years with Johnny Thunder's adventures in the Amazon Ancient Ruins. The Vitals: Year of release: 1999 Parts Count: 453 MSRP: $80.00 The set included eight figures: (from left) Two skeletons, Dr. Lightning, Gail Storm, Gabarros, Achu, Johnny Thunder, and Señor Palomar. On the far right is my new sigfig, el Conde Voltio Villar. Construction begins with Dr. Lightning and his jeep. It's a sturdy Adventurers-style vehicle, with fatter tires at the rear for better traction. Next is Gabarros and his unusual boat. The hull is from Belleville/Paradisa sets, where it is usually pink or white. TLG ought to have put it in the Pirate theme, as it is a nice, intermediate size. In this set, it is a small steamship. The temple is built on modular 8x8 green bricks which fit into square holes in the baseplate. This is the ""treasure room."" This square has a nasty double-spear trap. Careful... This is the top section of the temple, crowned by Achu the (mummified?) Incan. More modular sections (these are from the front of the temple site, across the river from the main building). El Conde: ""You are too beautiful a woman to be wandering alone in the jungle, Miss Storm. Please, allow me to accompany you."" Gail Storm: ""I'm with Johnny, and I have a cutlass."" El Conde: ""I'll be on my way."" Here's the finished temple, with all parts in place. Now for the traps... ""Hmm, a giant ruby to bring home to the king."" ""¡Uf!"" ""That was embarassing. Miss Storm saw me fall..."" ""And now I've fallen again!"" ""I had better rest here before something worse happens."" ""¡Chispas!"" ""That's it, I'm leaving this place!"" ""Why me? Why?"" The Verdict: This is a fine set, a set whose bare parts/price ratio does not accurately reflect the intricacy of its design nor the rarity of its parts. I had to buy replacements for some of them, and let me tell you, they are PRICEY! That green baseplate? $14. The little dark gray saucepan near the fire? Not available on Bricklink at any price. The brown boat hull? VHTF. With this set, parts quality trumps parts quantity. And the minifigures are wonderful! There's not a dud in the bunch with the possible exception of the very common Dr. Lightning, and even he is not bad. When you factor in the coherence of the color scheme and the brilliant traps, it is obvious that 5986 is a classic. 10/10 Edited by WhiteFang, 27 November 2008 - 05:33 AM.

I never knew of this set 'till now, and it really looks great! I never paid much attention to those Aztec/Incan style sets, which I now regret. I love the bright colours used here, and all the great traps, there's so many of them, which is exactly what we can expect from an old Incan temple like this one. I'm surprised there's no catapult. Anyway, the minifigs included are also great, and am I right in guessing those bricks are printed? That would be fantastic, as they look amazing. That boat hull is new to me too, although I guess the fact that it's mainly in Belville sets explains that pretty well.

A well designed set, very playable with a lot of nifty traps, a very good use of that raised baseplate and really nice crafts. The MF characters´re excellent too! And although the color scheme´s great and original, especially with all these neat printed pieces, it´s perhaps the only part of that set that looks a little out of date today.... Nevertheless, the set´s plain charming and shows clearly that TLC don´t need licenses to do some distinct Adventurer sets."

Since it came out in 1999 I have only seen this set in a toystore one single time, one single copy as well... It was in the summer of 1999 in Belgium (Arlon) in a store called 'Maxi Toys' (Belgiums TRu, I think). They had the three biggest Junglesets for sale there: these Ancient Ruins, The set with the beautiful black boat and the zeppelin. Being into Adventurers at that time I had never seen the entire Jungle theme (not even in a leaflet or catalog) and surprised as I was I bought all three sets. That was one happy Dutch boy in Belgium! Surprisingly the two smallest sets made it in very small quantities to my local stores in Holland (except for the pontoon plane and small raft which was my very first Shop at Home order). The spider's secret I bought off BL, which makes me the proud owner of the entire Jungle Serie. Back to the set: This was the first time in a long history of collecting Lego that I had a deformed piece: an 2x8 red plate was twisted, I twisted it back and it still serves it's purpose... I loved the whole steam-idea in this Jungle serie: the two boats both (including the one in this set) had nice steamengines and a very cool mechanic (yours has the wrong hat/hair btw) to come along with them. The skeleton falling down on the end of a chain was the most intriguing part of this set for me, it worked really well and when you were done scaring minifigures you could winch it up again ready for the next go. The only thing I did not really like about this set was the difference in wheelsize on the car, front small, back large and the way the palmtree consisted out of just three parts... All in all a great set that is becoming more rare and expensive as we speak/post. Get it! Edited by simonwillems, 26 May 2008 - 07:59 PM."

No, there are no stickers in this set. While some Adventurers sets of the era had stickers (the 5956 Zeppelin had tons), all of the interesting mesoamerican designs from this set are printed. Also, simonwillems was correct; my mechanic is missing his hat, which should be a black kepi. They're extremely expensive on BL, though (proving once again that this set has some awesome parts), so I ordered a replacement from Lego. It's in the mail and should come soon."

The box is ofcourse far larger than necessary! There's plenty of air inside. The contence is one bag and the instruction booklet, you could proably build it inside the bag if the desire took you. We have one new coastguard with the slightly stubly head found in the castle range and a trans-clear visor. The build was challanging and arduious The final product is quite nice at one ?3.00 it's a good set only 50p more than an impulse set and with enough extra parts to justify the increase in the price.

The new 7738 Coast Guard Helicopter! itsmy first review, so go easy on me! lets start off with the small stuff. First the mini figs. You get 4 figs total. Two helicopter pilots, a diver and a civilan to rescue. The torso's are nothing new on the pilot and diver. Same ones as in the last coast guard line. But i like the colors alot better in this coast guard line than the previous generation. The yellow and blue really work well together and the coloring on the badge looks great! The civilian looks to be just a dock worker with an overall torso and a beenie. The diver has nice vented helmet and a pair of flippers that suits his duty perfect! Next we have an absolute work of lego art. The rescue raft! The orange flaps can be moved back for easy entry to the raft, as well as the white ""support"" beams with the caution tape. I put support in perenthaces cause they really don't support anything. Just there to fill in the gaps. At the top of the raft is a red locator beacon, ccommunications antenna, and a cargo loop for lifting the raft. lets move on to the interior of the raft. Not much here. But you can see the techinc beam that attaches to the top loop,and to the floor of the raft. So far this has proven to be very sturdy and has supported the full weight of the raft quite well. You can also see the white box that holds the equipment of the raft. Here you can see the life saver tube. Here's a shot with our dock worker peaking out the side. The raft says max ocupants 4, but with the storage box, that might be a tight fit. Now lets move on to the Helicopter! in my opinion this is one of the best helicopters TLC has come out with to date. I really felt they captured the look and proportions of a real Coast Guard helicopter. it uses a lower hull and tail section of the new airliner, and cargo airplane. It really seems to work well with this application. The engines have good detail using new ""cheese graders"" as vents, as well as the new engine stacks that come in the new speed racer sets. The rotors also appear to be new as well. lets move on to the cockpit. We have two seats for our pilots with a sticker sheet for intruments on a flat 4 wide plate. There's also an antena being used as a flight stick. Another shot with our pilots at the helm. Now lets moveon to the high lihgt of this heavy lifting machine. The med bay, and lifting winch. http://www.brickshel...icopter_020.jpg here you can see the winch arm at rest, along with the medical strechter. The bad part is that the med. strechter doesn't include the ussually included fold away wheels. here's a shot with the winch arm extened ready for rescue! In the second shot you can see the drum that the wire coils up in. It coils up via a recently new power functions ""pull"" back motor. To operate, just pull out the winch cable, hook on your load, and presse this orange button on the side... The bad part of the new power functions winch is that although its very smooth in its operation, its not very strong. It will only lift the raft a couple inches before it runs out of torque. It also has a tendency to want to pull the crane arm backin while its lifting. It doesn't matter if its a light load, or heavy load. The bay doors open on both sides for easy postioning of the figures and accses to the strechter. Here we have our diver looking over his rescue-e. Nice and roomy if you don't mind a crane arm being in your way!! At $39.99 and a peice count of 445, i felt this set was a great good considering what your getting. The raft construction is very creative and is probbly the highlight of the set by itself. The helicopter is probbly one of the best, if not the best helicopter TLC has ever came out with if you can get over its size. in a scale of one to five.... Price- Peice count- Playability- Design- overall- .5 I would have given it a full 5 out of five, but since the winch can't pull the raft all the way, it didn't fell it right. Even with this minor flaw, i still highly recomend this set!"

Klaus-Dieter There is no real way to lift up the stretcher. Due to the crane arm being in the way there really isn't any room for any kind oflifting straps. The set does include a 1x2 plate with a hinge for the diver to stand on so at least he can hold on to someone, the crane lifts them up and then he can put them in the strechter. Thats my guess at least. As far as the motor, i don't believe it uses bateries since you pull out the motor, and all the button does is recoil the winch line back in. I have to say it does a very good job of that, and is very smooth. (as long as you don't have anything to heavy) One detail i forgot to meation is the shark.

You've got the photography down very well I feel. Perhaps a bit of nitpicking but at the end where you assign a rating, if you do a rating with faces (which is fine by me) you may want to seperate the faces by a line.

This doesn't really remind me of any particular model, other than perhaps an EH. 101 Merlin and even that resemblance is very superficial. Just for the record: this is a Sikorsky Sea King and this is a Sikorsky MH-53 (a derivation of the CH-53). The only resemblance I see with the former is the colour scheme and with the latter the fact that it's got a fat rear-end, sponsons and six blades. It doesn't matter though, because I really like it. The colour scheme is great, the shape is nice, it's got quite a bit of detail and I just have to get my hands on the cockpit window and those new rotor blades. When I first saw the large aircraft pieces a few years ago I figured they were very much single-use parts, but the tail end doesn't look too bad. Pretty clever. I like the raft too. It really does look like the real deal. That the helicopter can't lift it really isn't an issue, because in real life they wouldn't lift the raft either. They'd use the rescue hoist to lift the occupants of the raft into the helicopter one by one (or perhaps in pairs). Imagine a storm with a helicopter hovering over tall waves with a big fat raft strung from a cable underneath it. The raft would catch a lot of wind and flop around quite a bit, causing it to loose all its occupants and also yanking the helicopter around, possibly causing the pilot to loose control and crash. Bad idea! Cheers, Ralph Edited by Ralph_S, 30 May 2008 - 11:09 PM."

I always figured the hoses were welding torches (attached to jetpacks, yeah!) as the whole thing had the vibe of a mobile repair center. Much like many of my favorite sets, this one has a base of simple bricks and plates and then from that solid foundation the rest is built out to be decorative or have the action features. This gives sets a very solid feel as demonstrated in this set, the first Snowspeeder, and Galaxy Explorer. The MM Armored Drilling Unit has a more technic base giving it a less solid appearance and though I like the set, that jet that luanches from the back is horrible, partially because of the useless orange containment things. The Mega Core has a nifty crane instead of a big useless jet. -Tohst"

Of course it´s a money issue.... my question was more rhetorical. But I still don´t like how they sacrifice inherent set design on the altar of cost saving efforts. To be even more correct, I don´t understand why they try to make extraordinary cool looking sets with a pretty weak 'inner life'. Yeah, they want to sell sets with something that looks exciting on the box art, but.... LEGO was (and fortunately, is, with many recent sets too) always more than just an impressive spaceship or S.F. tank vehicle.... it´s the sum of the set itself and its parts and what you can do with it that makes out the full fun of it. The best thing you can do with a new set, beside some UCS sets perhaps, is to MOD the set according to your own likings. This is where 'just imagine' begins, and how kids start to learn how to MOC, at least it was like that to me.... Individualizing official sets, and looking on some cool alternative models gave me my first ideas and helped my imagination and skills to grow, back in these days when I was a wee child. Books, movies and t.v. series as a source of inspiration just came a little later.... I can see many people complaining about how to make the alternative models, yes, but just stop using them on the box art´s a very poor solution and a dangerous one too, at least in long terms. Of course I know that you know all these things too, Sinner. I just think it´s a shame, and a risk too, because TLC´s perhaps sacrificing more than they might know by yet.... Building with bricks is the main attraction of LEGO, not just some cool crafts to play around with.... others can do this too and maybe better than TLC. If the kids of today ever forget about the fascination of being imaginative, TLC´ll only lose in the end."

I want to preface my review by admitting that I’m an unrepentant Harley Quinn fanboy. I’ve been enamored with the character since she first appeared in Batman: The Animated Series back in the 90’s, and I’ve since followed her misadventures through her introduction into the regular Batman series during No Man’s Land, into her own series, and even on the short-lived and not-so-good Birds of Prey TV show. So please excuse any pro-Harley bias. So, down to business. The 267 piece set retails for $30 US ($35 at Toys R Us) and builds up very fast and easy. It consists of Batman’s Bat Cycle, Harley’s Hammer Truck, and brand new Batman and Harley Quinn Minifigs. There is also no lack of weapons. In addition to the usual bag of Bat-accessories and guns, the set also comes with a pair of gray revolvers. Batman in this set has the new “armor” torso print and the hips are the same color as the legs, hinting that this is supposed to represent the movie style Batsuits more so then the traditional comic book “underwear over tights” look. Harley Quinn is a very cool looking Minifig, and I haven’t grinned so much at a new Batman character figure since my first Batman Minifig a couple years ago. The figure is very true to the character, and the torso has been accented with a few shape lines to try and distinguish her as a female despite the boxy body. Harley’s jester cap is an interesting new piece. It seems (to me at least) to be made of a slightly different grade of plastic then we’re used to. It’s molded in red and painted with black and white, and it comes packed in its own separate little baggie. I expect that this piece may have cost LEGO a little more then usual to produce. Harley also has a buildable accessory, a giant mallet. Sure, she can’t stand up all that well unless it’s held in specific ways, but it’s neat and most importantly, it’s funny. It’s especially fun for smacking the everloving crap out of other Minifigs with. The Bat Cycle is in bag number one and is a very fast build. This isn’t some little Japanese sport bike like Nightwing’s cycle. This monster is almost a car and seems to pack just the right amount of intimidation for the Caped Crusader to exploit. Thanks to the thick tires (two in front, one in back) it stands up just fine on its own and rolls very well. The huge exhaust pipes are a nice touch and give the thing a look of engine power. The only real flaw is the inclusion of the flick-fire missiles mounted on the sides. But, as with any LEGO model, they can be easily left out without hurting the look of the vehicle. The hammer truck is the bulk of this set and a lot more fun then it looks. Of the monster truck persuasion, the vehicle is designed and built with a surprising level of solidity. The axle mounts are particularly impressive. The big wheels and tires just beg you to drive this thing right over the Bat Cycle (or Batman). The mega-mallet gimmick is also a surprise. Not so much for its technical complexity, there isn’t any really, but for the fact that once you start turning the knob at the rear to swing the mallet back and forth, it’s really a lot of fun. There are some low points to the truck design. Again the flick-fire missiles are tacked on and there’s a cargo crate/bed set into the back for Harley’s loot of jewels. The crate would have looked a lot better molded in black. In brown it breaks up the look of the truck a little. Speaking of which, the look of the truck is very pleasing. The red and black Harley Quinn color scheme works really well on the vehicle. There are a few stickers here, and unfortunately, the diamond patterned ones are applied over multiple bricks. The rest, however, are great. Not only does she have an “I Love Joker” bumper sticker, but she has a Joker playing card taped to her dash, I guess serving as a picture of her beloved Puddin’. There is also a sticker for activation of the hammer, which boldly shouts HIT ME! This is a fun set. A neat new Batman vehicle and a big truck with lots of playability. The Harley Minifig is a must-have for any Bat-Fan and, if you only get one of the Batman sets this year, I’d recommend this one. The price versus piece-count on this set is a little bit of a deterrent though. This might not be the best set for collectors on a budget or people looking for something completely new and innovative, but anyone buying this for a child can rest assured that the kid will get your money’s worth out of the set through its play value. When added together and averaged out, the pros and cons of this set combine to give it a score of out of 5. Even if Harley herself is a clean 6 out of 5"

Somewhere along the line, I stopped caring about food and decided to browse the toy department to see what they had Lego-wise. Usually, they have jack squat, but on this particular day they had a lot of new sets. I impulsively picked this set up, along with Harley Quinn's Hammer Truck and the new little campsite from the Indy 4 line. I must say, when I first saw images of this set I wasn't exactly thrilled or anything. I mean, I didn't really see anything particularly special about it, but after purchasing it, I must admit that I would consider it a must buy for any Lego fan. But enough babbling about myself. Onward with the review (my first of an official set)! In this picture, you can see everything you get with the set. I thought the box-art was pretty nice looking. The manual, on the other hand, took somewhat of a beating within the box, a common problem with most more recent sets. I do have to say that I wish they would at least make some effort in fixing this. They could just make a little thin cardboard ""folder"" to minimize bending and tears. For Batman minifig collector's, the highlight of this set are the Robin and Penguin figs. Previously, you could only get them in the pricey Bat-Cave set, but this set provides a much cheaper alternative. One thing you will notice, however, is that Robin's hairpiece is a new mold, as it is actually a black version of Mutt's hair (from the Indy 4 line). Personally, I think it actually looks better than the hairpiece used on the older version of Robin. As the Batcave had before it, this set comes with some bricks to make two cute (but deadly) penguins. They help add more charm to an already charming set. When you're finished building, you'll end up with a nice little assortment of extra parts; 1 black ""cheese slope,"" 3 1x1 tile (black, yellow and white), a revolver, a technic pin, and a 1x1 red round plate. Here's Robin's Scuba Jet. It's nice and sleek looking. Notable parts of interest would probably be the green turbine engines. My only complaint on this one would have to be the use of decals on the 2x2 round yellow tiles. For that type of a part, printing seems as though it would have been the best way to go. Now for, in my opinion, the best part of the set...the Penguin's sub. This set has more decals than Robin's Scuba Jet, but they seem more necessary in this case. I actually wanted to put the decal's on the sub, as I think the it looks great with them. Obviously, it looks like a penguin, but wow, does it ever do it with style! It has a lot of interactive features, the first of which I will mention, being the periscope which raises up and down. And for the collectors of parts in new colors, it has a few parts in medium orange?, such as 2x2 tile. Here's a shot of the bottom of the sub. Another nifty little feature is how you can lift the top off and fit the penguin inside. And there is enough room inside, so that you can firmly place top on again, and without interference to the movement of the periscope. Another little feature is the rear spring-loaded missile. You just tilt the small lever toward the front of the sub, and it fires. And the last small feature are the flick-missiles on each side. Overall, this is a great set with a lot to offer for a decent price. A lot of fans might view the only drawback to it as being the use of decals, but if you plan on keeping the kit together they make it look really fantastic. Buy it if you can.

However, I am rather dissapointed that this set is so similar to the vehicles of Penguin and Robinin repectively in the Batcave set.

They've fought chainsaw-armed villains, battled radio-controlled cyborg crocs, chased pallets of badly-stored golden loot and wrestled killer sharks with vicious, toothy grins. Finally they've caught the notorious Dr Inferno and imprisoned him in their cavernous Mobile Command Center. But Dr Inferno won't go down without a fight! Can the Agents stop the evil Dr 'Disco' Inferno fleeing? Will Spy Clops laser gun burn through the door in time, or will Dr Inferno simply use the lovely Agent Trace's enormous ponytail as an escape ladder to freedom? More importantly, will there be a riot in the streets of Lego City as AFOLs go apopletic at the thought of a 12 wide truck roaring through their ordered town layouts? Stay tuned! Part 1: The Box, Instructions, Parts As the largest of the Agents sets (so far), the box is easily the biggest. Trainee agents, examine the following three pics and see if you notice anything odd. Box front: Box back: Box middle: Spot it? That's right. The printed cardboard which has supposed to be the bottom half of the fold out middle section is on the back, slicing the ultra-large set image which would form the foldout in half . The way the cardboard is printed as one piece before it's folded I think this would be very hard to do 'accidentally' so suspect a major stuff-up somewhere along the production line. I bought this set off bricklink so would be very interested if anyone in the States who has seen these boxes actually on the shelves can tell me if this is common or rare. Basically I want to know if I should be annoyed that the bricklink seller didn't list this in the set description, or are they all like this? The instructions come in 4 booklets. The parts list comes in at 5 pages, which is a lot even at half-size pages ! Large images of the parts inventory are in this folderwhen moderated for anyone interested. Here's also some cute Agents-type artwork at the end of one of the books. Instructions show piece call-outs and are divided into sections according to numbered bags. As you'd expect for a set with 1100+ parts, this baby comes with a lot of bags. It's a treasure trove of dark blue. As well as the obvious large slopes and wall panels which make up the body and the roof, there is a wealth of smaller navy blue pieces as well - small 1x1 bricks, 2x2 bricks, 1x1 plates, 2x2 tiles, heaps of 2x plates, some slopes, 22x cheese pieces... basically anyone wanting a lot of dark blue should think about this set. The roof panels alone, for example, could provide a dark blue sea for a modernised Pirate MOC. 2 DSSs (Dreaded Sticker Sheets). Quelle surprise - stickers! The grey parts of the stickers here are metallic silver ink, which is a nice touch. Actually, as sticker sheets go, they're not too bad. Fairly subtle for the most part and the navy blue actually matches the bricks themselves. However, after looking at the sticker sheets I thought I was missing something. What about the pieces used for the projection screens showing Dr Inferno and the sharks - why weren't they on the sticker sheets? There must be another one! Frantically I checked and rechecked the box and flipped through all the instruction manuals to find the elusive 3rd sheet. Where was it? Ten minutes later I noticed something which had honestly never occured to me - THERE WERE ACTUAL PRINTED PIECES IN THIS SET! So obvious and yet so unthinkable. It's horrifying how years and years of Exoforce and Speed Racer set releases can mentally condition people's thought processes. Tut tut, Lego. What have you reduced us to? Here they are, folks - ACTUAL PRINTED PIECES. (Yes, I do believe this news deserves the caps.) I also noticed this nifty modification of the usual 2x3 cupboard - you can now fit drawers in it! Very clever. This may have been around in Belville sets for years for all I know, but it's new to me. The drawers slide in and out very well and the top one sits on slight indentations in the middle of the cupboard. Part 2: The figs! Our trusty agents - Charge, Chase, Trace and Fuse. (High powered agents don't have time for names of more than one syllable - that's why the bad guys always lose ). Chase and Fuse have the Mutt hair in black and dark orange. The lovely Agent Trace has an exquisite new hairpiece in dark brown, perfect for 'Rapunzel' themed MOCs. As you can see, her ponytail is loooong. Makes it hard to sit down, the poor girl. I feel sorry for all these female figs with such intricate hairstyles that they can never relax in an ordinary Lego chair. However, at least she has two breasts unlike the recent Harley Quinn fig. Compensation indeed. Seriously though, it's great that there's a separate torso print for the female character and this attention to detail is typical of the set as a whole. Three of the agents have reversable heads - nice touch with the headsets and I like the ID cards on their pants. Obviously the agents security system is based on some kind of crotch measuring device. This would make sense considering the conspicuous bulges in the pants of Dr Inferno's men (see the other Agents set reviews.) The villains - Spy Clops, Dr Inferno, Gold Tooth. Dr Inferno's hair in all it's glory. This is a great piece, although the orange colouring is a little rough on the front. It's so 3D, it deserves a back and side view (and indeed EB thread) all of its own. As mentioned elsewhere, this is different plastic to the normal minifig hair, but it doesn't quite feel as soft as the Exo-force hair. It doesn't fall off as much, anyway. The figs get 10/10 from me. Awesome hairpieces in great colours for the Agents and a sleek navy blue/ neon green uniform. The villains' faces are great and they are all very distinctive. The attention to detail is outstanding and it's great to see a Lego in-house theme with characters as memorable and cool as figs from the licensed themes . Part 3: The build The build is divided into three stages - the small vehicles, the front of the truck, and the massive command center section. (a) Small vehicles First up, all the small vehicles. We have a small flyer, 2 buggies, jet ski, and a speed boat - all in glorious navy blue with little bits of silver detailing. Top view. These vehicles are all simple, small and well-designed. Probably the weakest is the flyer, only because the cockpit looks a little large. In fact, the small flyer is probably the weakest element of 8365 overall, which tells you how good the set itself is! In various threads here, this set has been heavily criticised for being way out of proportion. There's a reason for that, as we shall come to. However, the existence of these small sets should appease some people. With the new coast guard sets, for example, all of these save the flyer wouldn't look out of place on a City beach with a little modding. Here's an example - agents beach party! (Spongebob couldn't help but crash.) The villains only have one small vehicle, but they've been well-served in the smaller sets, and this one is a unique and clever design. I love the triangular shape and the simple but clever technique of making the arch slopes meet up around the propellers. It's sort of insectile in black and orange, and looks very different from the usual assortment of helicopters etc. (b) Truck front This thing is a beast! Seriously, look at it. It's chunky and mean looking. You don't want to mess with this baby. The build is really nice. Like a lot of Star Wars vehicles, it's all based on technic beams pinned together. Unlike a lot of Mars Mission sets, underneath isn't ALL technic beams with some plates slapped on like a facade. The majority is a lot of plates and bricks which all fit together solidly. You can see from the detailing of 'cheese grater' slopes and silver pieces on the front how effort has been made to give this vehicle a distinct feel different to other Lego sets. Sure, the silver slope mirrors might be a bit too much for some, but this baby is all about attitude. You can imagine it roaring down the road en route to Dr Inferno's diabolical lair! After all, these sets are 'Agents' sets - nobody said they were *secret* Agents (c ) Command center - whole assembly Here's a view of the whole thing assembled - inside and cool details to follow at the end. It's kind of hard to show here as it is extreeeeemely long. This is indeed a big set. The build for the trailer part of the command center is fun and very satisfying. Yes, there are large pieces but there is also a huge amount of detail. It is also solid as a rock. I remember being annoyed building the big Ferrari truck a few years ago - everytime you looked at it, an 8 x 16 plate fell off. The Mobile Command Center is solid - even with the hinged roof and special features, it is not delicate at all. Kudos to the designers, again as it is mainly a brick build rather than a technic one. I also like how the command center part connects to the cabin - it's not a special piece at all, just a technic axle going through two circle plates, but it works and it's solid. (Please note I've been selective about which stickers I've applied during the build.) Top view: The rear: Here's an example of why I like the build: (a) the designers have enough sense to put a ladder so a minifig can climb up to the interior when the command center is open (b) notice that although the ladder clips at the top, there is an *extra* clip there in the middle purely to hold it in place so it doesn't flap around and holds firm. I don't know if most designers would even think to put a ladder there let alone go the extra mile and put a mechanism to hold it in place. Pure class. Oh, and notice the greebly detail stuff to the right there too. The other side. This is probably the other weak part of the build - the bricky gaps at the top where the hinge to open the roof sits. It's a little gappy but the set is so big you don't really notice. (d) And now for the fun stuff - inside and neat details! OK, so we've built the thing. It's big. It's blue. The top of the trailer itself would make a good warehouse MOC for a harbour layout. But what about inside? Is it any good? What about all those small vehicles from the start of the review? Where do they go? Well, I'm glad you asked. Because the solution is superb. The small flyer folds slightly and slides into place here: Lift off the roof and you're away! The large buggy and the speedboat go under here: The jetski slides out of the rear here, attached to its own little platform: And the small buggy goes inside the main cabin. There's even a crane so you can lift it down. So now we know why this set is so large! To fit everything in! It's amazing that this functionality doesn't affect the aesthetics of the set as a whole. But we still haven't finished on the details. The front section has a very easy-to-swing-open roof section and missiles: There's also a command section underneath the bit where the flyer lifts out: And now for the interior. I have to say I really like this space. Not only is it packed with great stuff, there's also enough room for minifigs to move around. I hate bases where the figs only have about 2 studs to actually stand and walk. Aquabase Invasion is a nice set, for example, but the actual functional space inside the base is teensy. Claustrophobia! You know within a week they'd be fighting to toss each other out of the airlock. No such problems for these suave Agents, who have plenty of legroom *and* the ability to launch missiles from their ceiling. The whole of the interior: Zooming in: Moving from left to right. First off, the medicine cabinet. Looks like someone's been leaving secret mission dossiers lying around. The projector area for mission briefings. Dr Inferno recently changed his hair colour from purple to orange, it seems. Why are all these minifigs so obsessed with their hair? The projector folds down when the trailer is open. Push the button and the light glows on. Now Dr Inferno's hair is orange again! This is one of my favourite parts of the set. It works a charm. The batteries for these lightbricks can also be replaced - instructions are in the manual. Agent Charge considers shark-fin soup for dinner. Did I mention these projection panels are printed? The detail is very fine too. The tool section. Laptops sit in the middle compartment. You get some flippers, yellow scuba tank and various implements. I'm so impressed that the helmet is pearl silver with a different coloured visor too - there's so much variation in the parts in this set, you don't get the sense the designers are using the same thing over and over to save money. It all feels luxe and top-of-the-line, just like the Command Center itself. Two laptops - yay! The aforementioned rooftop missiles: The Dr Inferno cage. Nasty electric shocks! Bzzt! (You can see my reviewing skills are burning out now - sentences.... truncated...) Another example of detail - nowhere else in the set is a 1x1 transgreen tile used - they could have used a 1x1 trans green cheese wedge piece as there are others in the set, but they didn't. How does Dr I get out? Flick that lever on the right hand exterior and the door pops open. Spy Clops the loyal minion awaits his master on the other side. And there we have it. Take a bow, guys! There's a lot of spare parts. A suspicious amount of dark blue small slopes but I checked the instructions and didn't see anything missing. I have to say, I do like the new policy (since Speed Racer I think) of including these small slopes as extras. Part 4: Overall Rating If you've made it this far, you've got more stamina than Dr Inferno's army of cyborg animals themselves! As I said earlier, this set has drawn criticism for the size of the truck. However, large vehicles do exist - I grew up in a wheat farming area and as a kid the size of the lorries that thundered past carrying grain was probably intimidating to me as this monstrous espionage machine is to the good citizens of Lego City! On top of that, it *does* contain a plethora of 4-wide vehicles inside ! Criticism of this set on the basis of size to me also seems misguided as this is basically a playset - and it is a very good one to boot. As you can probably tell, I love it to pieces and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone, whether for parts or for play value. Check out the parts list in this folderwhen moderated and you can see just how many excellent pieces it contains. A light-up brick, a flood of navy blue, metallic silver bricks - we're spoiled. 8635 is also an enjoyable build, with fantastic figs and top-of-the-line detailing. In a year when I've found City a bit disappointing after the run of great sets in 2006-2007, the Agents line has been one of the surprise hits for me and I can't wait to see what the designers come up with next.

Space invaders, holograms, compulsory seat-belt wearing legislation, and the return of classic Space. Ok, we don't have a fully fledged classic space theme back yet, but if 7645 is the way of the future, I think Lego is ready to do it properly. I wasn't a huge fan of last year's Mars Mission sets and only picked up a few on clearance, but this set is light years (excuse the pun) ahead of 2007's offerings. This mining vehicle is solid, compact, and well-designed. It looks impressive, and even better, it has fantastic Power Functions operability! Behold 7645 - MT-61 Crystal Reaper! (PS I wasn't joking about the holograms or seat belts.) Part 1: Box, Instructions, DSSs (Dreaded Sticker Sheets), Parts Front of box: Back of box: 2 x instruction booklets: DSS numero uno - for the Reaper DSS number two - apologies for the blurry pic but I wanted to capture the sweet shimmy of the metallic holographic background on this sheet The way it catches the light really makes a difference to the small alien craft and makes it look much more interesting from the plain stickers of last year. There's heaps of spare silvery stuff once the stickers are applied for those who use the leftover sticker material for customising. Parts bags - 4 numbered with one extra with larger pieces Parts everywhere - woo! I know the Lego instruction books scold me if I mix bags, but I'm a devil-may-care kind of guy. In your face, TLC. I love mixing all the parts together before I build, it reminds me of my youth when the days were long, anything was possible, and I didn't need strict instructions not to build on grass or poke my eye out with a technic shooter. Interesting parts - these may or may not be new, my technic knowledge is not that detailed. The little scoop parts are so cute and have a heap of potential uses. I love 'em. They're like Smurf hats at Miniland scale. These technic wheel things in orange are also cute. They kind of remind me of marigolds. Giant Fabuland marigolds! The track pieces - you get 70 of these - here's the section of track for one side - as you can see it's about 52 studs long. These hold together better than the small ones on the Hailfire Droid/ Jungle Cutter. Part 2: Minifigs, small mining transport, alien ship I have to confess - I forgot to take an individual snap of the astronauts . It's the usual bunch though - Scaredy Face guy, Sunglasses in Space Man and a third one I can't remember. You don't really care, though? You're only interested in the alien commander and his matching arms/ legs combo deal. As brickbitz noted in his review of the smaller set, the glowy eye is just a 1x1 cylinder. The set also comes with 2 normal jellies - one pictured here for size. You'll see what happened to the other one soon enough... The alien craft is nothing exciting, apart from the gorgeous glinting stickers. Here's the road safety angle. The commander actually clips onto a 1x2 plate with handle so he can't fall out! Then the lime tentacle thing descends on top of him to keep him firmly there, like a baby seat. Not very brave for an alien commander, is he? I mean, did Darth Vader ever use a seatbelt? Tssk. With cradle up: This part of the build also includes the small astronaut mining buggy - small and effective. (Please note in this build I've applied stickers to everything bar cockpit pieces.) This comes with radio and saw piece. Part 3: The Reaper! The first part of the build is the detachable shuttle. I really like the retro aesthetic of this with the angled wings and the side hoverpod things. It is much better than the comparable vehicle from 7699. The new flickfire piece is a waste of space - it's fairly limp. I prefer the simple flickfire technic pin to be honest. There's also a very nice little side workshop as you can see. I really like how the control unit is 'plugged' into the wall via 5 1x1 round plates (third pic, it's a bit dark). Great detail. [The technic pins on the back are there to connect the Power Functions battery box. It's odd they're included at this stage of the instructions - maybe the intention was to release it originally with all the necessary motors etc but the price point was too high and they scaled it back] The base. The shuttle sits on that bley technic axle in the middle when the Reaper is fully assembled. The little vehicle scoots down the ramp at the rear, which folds up to hold it in place when the Reaper is in motion. You can see there's a crystal container here as well - another nice small detail which I found the 2007 sets lacked. There's also an alien here - thankfully not in those horrendous trans-orange tubes so prevalent last year. The complete assembly. Isn't it snug? It's just the right size too - not massive but large enough to be a serious mining vehicle. The ominous black treads contrast nicely with the white/ orange colour scheme of the vehicle itself. The trans detailing - blue for weapons, neon green for energy - is carried nicely through the whole set. The blades and the scoops whirl nicely as the machine trundles along. Top down view: Tread detail: Whirling blades of death! The buggy descends: Probably the most disturbing aspect of the whole set is this pic: The jelly has an orange pump plugged into its heart which is connected to an energy supply on the left hand side! This vehicle runs on alien jelly juice! Either that or it's milking the jelly in some equally disturbing fashion. How amoral is that! I know there's been debate about this - the jellys aren't innocent, they're evil energy crystal thieving maniacs etc - but I find it a bit odd that the humans respond by chaining the jelly up to the bowels of their mining vehcile and suck energy from its heart. People debate about violence in Lego as represented by realistic minifig weapons, but I think the moral lesson here is even worse - it's OK to exploit foreign life forms for our own gain if they treat us badly first! (Who-fans, I think the Ood should have a word with the jelly Commander ) That aside, this set is well-designed and fairly good value at $AUD79.95. It's definitely a notch above last year's Mars Mission sets overall, with improved detailing and more useful functions. The holo-stickers are fab and it's nice to have an alien commander, even if he is a bit bulky and his fingers are identical to his toes. However, if all these reasons by themselves weren't reason to recomend this set, the following is.... Part 4: Power Functions The best part of this set - and the reason I bought it, really - is the integration of Power Functions. Bizarrely this isn't mentioned at all on the box and I only found out about it from the instructions when they were posted on Eurobricks! (Instructions for book 2 which has the Power function stuff available here.) This is a great idea and hopefully we will see more new sets take this kind of approach (especially with the new Train sets). Luckily I got Monster Dino 4958 on sale for half price earlier this year so already had most of the necessary motors etc - the only one needed was an extra small one. What you need is listed in the instructions below with redirections to Shop @ Home to buy the motors. Note there's actually a mistake on this page. The 2 small motors you need are both 8883 not 8882 (which is the large XL motor). Way to confuse the kids there, Lego! Attaching them was a dream and only took a few minutes (In contrast to 4958 where it was almost impossible to remove motor elements without dismantling the model). Basically the back platform and some plates and orange slopes come off, you attach the motors, and then the smaller plates go back on. These parts are now left loose: Overall the look of the Reaper isn't badly effected as you're mainly viewing from the front anyway: Sadly I can't show you how it moves, you'll just have to trust me that it does ! The way it is steered is demonsrated in the instruction pages above. Basically each motor is controlled by a corresponding switch on the remote. Move them both forward to move forward, move one right to turn right, move both back to move back etc. It zips along! It's a speedy little thing! Personally I wouldn't want to be in it's path as it comes roaring down the Martian canyon! (My cat was scared as it was.) It is oodles of fun and definitely worth trying if you have the motors or can get them cheaply, and adds a whole new dimension to the 'play' aspect of 'playset'. It is also as I said very quick to switch between modded and non-modded Reaper in contrast to the more fiddly Dino creations. The only problem I had is that if it moves too fast, the weight of the battery box at the back tends to pull the whole thing back and it rears up. It does correct itself though. I only trialled this on carpet last night so it may behave differently on other surfaces - I will need to experiment! Part 5: Summation This is a great set made even better with the addition of Power Functions. At $AUD79.95 it's well-priced. Buy it! Buy the motors as well (K-Mart still has stock of 4958 at $89, wait for a 15% off sale)! You won't regret it. Buy 2 and make competing battle machines! The only thing is... just don't torture that poor jelly Edited by Sinner, 24 June 2008 - 03:25 AM."

I ordered this off of S@H last tuesday, and oddly enough, it's listed on S@H as MX-81 Hypersonic Airplane... I'd like to apologize for the random, horrible, faded pics. I took the review outside, and the clouds kept shifting, changing the lighting, and then I had to go inside because it started raining. It's been raining for a week. It's raining now, as I type this. So, I foolishly went outside to take pics. The front of the box. Not bad, as far as boxes go. It features a lift-up tab... ...which shows the various functions. Back of the box. Still not much to say... Two manuals. I think this is just right- Not too thick, but not too many manuals, either... Oddly enough, the box came with a little folded up piece of paper telling us not to mix the bags. It comes sorted into 4 bags, by the way. Minifigures The set features 3 normal MM figs, 1 normal jellie, and one of the new commanders. I really like this guy. He has a few issues, like his hands being stuck sideways, and still being hollow, but still a great improvement. He'll make a lovely addition to any Halloween MOC. Stickers The set comes with a fairly big DSS for the Spacecraft. Pretty normal, but I do like the dragon sticker. Then, suprises of suprises, a technicolor sticker sheet for the aliens! How cool is this, huh? The tops of the actual stickers are shiny, which is hard to see in the pic. Even the bottom is shiny! Who said stickers can't be cool? The mining craft The little guy is pretty cute, and well built. My only gripe is that there's nowhere to spin the drill! It seems so lifeless without a feature... The alien craft You'd think a Commander would be important enough to have a seatbelt, rather than be stabbed with a clip and stuck on the ship like those other grunt aliens... I think this thing has some potential. Shiny stickers, different body shape. And when you look at those engines, this thing could be an alien Corvette! But then you look at the back. Pretty bare, no flares or anything. It's a cool little craft, but it just...lacks. The modules These things have some potential, as well. With some modding, they could be pretty cool. Unfortunetly, it's pretty boxy, there are no engines, and the wings are too small. The top is pretty nice, though. The greebles are all right. The controls, as usual, are a sticker. Pretty spacious, mind you. The cockpit doesn't stay flush with the body, though. The front plate underneath it can be easily replaced with a brick to fix that. ...I'm not gonna comment on this. The main body Too bad. The 'labratory' isn't much of a lab. A trans-red panel and some tray thing are all that compose the 'lab'. I was expecting more, but true to form, this Mars Mission set has no impressive interior to speak of. There is a lot of space, though, so it shouldn't be hard to mod. Phew! The lab folds up like so. Pretty simple, and would allow access to the lab, if there was one. And then we have this thing. What is it? Defense laser? Communications array? Satellite T.V.? The modules connect like so (sorry, out of place...): Too bad the pins stick out... Various pics... As you can see, this thing has more of those bars than an AT&T commercial... (There, you understand the topic description now? ) The rear. It uses a white City plane wing for the...wings. When I first saw the prototype pics, I thought they slanted downwards... That would've been really cool. Ah, now to the platform. From the position of the drill, I think this could be a really cool turret location when I MOD it to more military space. Back to the bars. If we had space monkeys, they'd love this. This set has more bars than a jungle gym.( ) Here we see the button that drops the platform. Pretty clever, and it's not in the way. Best of all, it really works! Really well, actually. Good job, TLC. 2 more bars and a shooter mechanism. Jeeze, this is really setting itself up for a joke. A shooter mechanism walks into a bar... Never mind! Here we have the handle that allows you to pick it up safely. A good idea, but it's placed waaaay to far back, way off the center of balance. You have to hold on to it pretty well to keep it angled up, though it does stop your hands from getting in the way of the platform. Ah! The platform in action. This is really a neat little feature. Not only can the ship land in a reduced footprint, but it also prevents the nice white paint job from getting red dust all over it... It's centered pretty well, too, and you don't have to worry about knocking it over, just don't shove it back at all. Here we have the latch. When the button on top is pushed, this gets pulled inward... ...Which pulls out of this hole and allows it to swing neatly down. Good luck, and happy mining!! Again, sorry for the lack of in-progress review. I would've liked to take pics of the mechanism and so on, but typical of the MM sets, you can't really take it apart. Well, this is really a nice set, which can hopefully be upgraded with a better lab with little difficulty. Some of my military mod plans include: -Strip the lab and install a command center -get rid of lots of bars. The thing has more bars than Alcatraz. -Install some turrets. This is a big command ship, so why all the forward-facing weapons? It'll need some AA defense... -mod the landing platform to be a troop dropper with installable AA turret. -mod the cockpit pods to be more aerodymic. So, that's all folks. Shall I include one last ""bar"" joke?"

Some of the features may not be as good as I hoped they would, but overall this looks to be a really nice set. I'm so happy that the giant spacecrafts are finally back. Quote I've noticed a trend that the larger sets have plenty of parts potential but when assembled the model is not more than the sum of the parts... Eagle Base certainly didn't seem worth the asking price, at least this is one large model. On a positive note the lame aero tubes, darts and martian carrier pods have disappeared. Hm, actually, I don't see the comparison. Eagle base looked terible to me right from the start, so it was no suprise when it ended up being the weakest kit in the first year. This big ship, on the other hand, looked great as soon as I saw it, and still looks good."

(I'm being curious, not confrontational. ) Well, first and foremost like many other people I'm no fan of those dreaded unprinted minifig torsos and stickers. But also the cost to piece ratio of the set, it just seems too expensive for everything that you get, such as too many small parts and a lighter than usual piece count for the price. Though if it had included printed minifigs and other elements, I maybe would of been able to swallow its 100 USD cost a little easier. But Star Justice is still Lego SPACE in the most classic sense thats available today, and I will probably pony it up just because...

I can't afford it, so I'm not getting too attached to it, but in its own way, it's great. It's certainly reminiscent of Space sets of the past, as others have said, and the drop-down ramp section is just really cool. As an idea, you understand. Sure, the lab is a little crap, but at least the effort was made (sort of ). The sheer fact that it's so big though, really makes me like this. There's just something appealing about large spaceships. Not capital ships, just big space ships. With lots of guns!

Somehow it´s almost like Classic Space´s back indeed.... It´s a great star ship. It looks stream lined, original and impressive and even the huge plane wing part looks rather cool and smooth on it. It´s equipped at least with some kind of engines on top of the wings and although they´re made with only two a little 'juniorized' parts it´s better than nothing. There´s a lab or some sort of engine room with enough space inside to allow one or two MFs to play Scotty.... yeah! The two cockpits´re nicely detailed with a cool use of these orange 1x1 round plates and to detach one or all two of them reminds a lot of the playability of the good old Space sets. It seems even like it´s easy to attach them to some kind of Cloud City Twin-Pod Car thanks these hinged wings. Looks like some solid fun to me. Of course.... the cockpits aren´t airtight and even this reminds unfortunately of the post blue, grey and trans yellow era of CS. Anyway, there´s no real fun without some MODing I guess. Another great advantage of the set´s that it´s not overpacked with shooting things. One technic shooter, cool in grey and only one trans orange prison pod too. Well, I can surely live with that especially since it´s nicely asymmetrical. The drill rover´s very charming, a little like a rebuilt Oldsmobile Convertibe stranded on Mars. Sweet! And that platform feature´s plain nifty and well done too, very playable and useable for a lot of things. Hmm.... recently I complained a lot about the dense use of studless technic beams for the inner structure of vehicles like these ExoForce tanks par exemple which makes MODing (in an economical way) pretty frustrating.... but the beams here´re used in a very proper way. It should be fairly easy to MOD, let´s say, the back of that lab section up to perhaps even the cockpits to create a larger airtight area that could be boarded from the platform.... just to fit this certain spacers need for, um, realism.... There´re many more nice details too like that 'satelite t.v.' thingy and that cylinder with trans blue 2x2 dish for the knob or these cylinders with cones on that handle, and that Alien craft´s pretty nice and detailed as well. Like I said before.... I really feel like Classic Space´s back."

It brings a real feel of Classic Space to MM (No, I'm NOT talking in the third person. ). However, it does have its own small issues, which are nothing, really. I said that there's not much of a lab- but that's the beauty of lego. There's a lot of room in the ship, so it should be a piece of cake to mod to a bigger lab. Too many bars? I'll take them off. I really like the set, I just want to change it to suit my tastes. It looks beautiful- It will find a home among my other MM sets as a favorite. Iron Moose: Good question. It's about 17 inches wide, 11 inches tall (with ramp down), and 16 inches wide. As for the platform, it's pretty stable. It tilts back a small degree so it doesn't collapse when tapped on the nose, but I wouldn't leave it on the edge of a table while in that position."

I do agree that it definitely needs some MOCing, but with that work I think it has the potential to be a really amazing set in terms of what you could cram into it. The lab is a little disappointing, I've always wanted an enclosed cabin space in a vehicle this size because then all the little space guys can have a true meeting place! The drop-down landing ramp is my favourite part, it has lots of potential uses. Maybe it's even possible to integrate pneumatics :D"

Shadows will take over after this episode, if we make more... Today we are reviewing Mars Impulse sets 5616 and 5617. Starting with 5617 Alien Jet, I must say it is a small and quick build, the jellie, is made of hard plastic, which surprised me, as I had expected Jellies to be a soft plastic. The jet is mainly 2x4 plates, some swingy hinges, the ""seatbelt"" and a thing which I cannot seem to name My one gripe about it is that the Jelly cant see where he is flying, it looks better with a MF in it. There was a red 1x1 as a spare part. We move on to the 5616 Mini Robot, which is basically a ""safe"" brick, with binoculars, soem cheese slopes, little arms, and legs. The best part i must say was the metal detector and ""safe"" brick, as these seem to be quite rare in sets (By my knowlage anyway). The austronaut has a face, shown in Dr. Sinsters review. The set also comes with a pick-axe and lime green gem. Extra peices where a cheese slope, a green 1x1 and a white droid arm. That concludes these mini-reviews. I also will use this opportunity to show my photo setup. Both sets are reccomended, if you either need a army, or are just trying to get a variaty of figs like myself.

Firstly, I must emphasize that I am not a very big Harry Potter fan or owned many Harry Potter sets. For this review, I will be highlighting what is the beauty of this small little set, and the reasons to own multiple sets of it. Comments and critics are strongly welcomed. This set is featured in the Harry Potter movie, Prisoner of Azkaban. This set is orignally released in 2004, align with the Harry Potter's movie. This was actually one of the movie scene where Buckbeak the griffin is appeared in the movie. The group of students are supposed to be having up close and personal with him. However, Draco decided to disturb our lovely Buckbeak. Enough of this movie synopsis, I am sure fans of Harry Potter will know this better. Box art Featured mini-fig/creature Background scene The scene is a simple garden, which had a very good mixture of spare parts for your MOCs building. On its own, there is nothing outstanding about this set, except for the griffin. You can buy multiple sets for the griffin alone and for Draco mini-fig. Well, you don't need lots of Draco. But for Castle lovers, black cap are exceptionally useful, at least from my view. Now, I will point out the following why this sets is so great for other reasons. Hidden cover Note that, this is the only mechanism which you can find in this set. It looks rather simple but quite useful. There are some little things hide in it too. Greens, Foilage and Brown parts Needless to say much, it offer 3 foilage, a green plant, 3 brown slopes, 2 ideal bricks and 1x1 brown brick for building a tree. Great for jungle building, forest building and etc. I am sure there are many builders will look out for these. Interesting parts It comes with a wizard book, owl, 2 printed tiles with a spider and stone prints on it. The far right, seriously I don't find any good use for it. Can any EB members enlighten me on that gray thing on the right? Grey parts It comes with a good 10 x 4 green plate. Useful for adding as a platform. Some more grey slopes for your MOCs. There you have it, Draco encounter with Buckbeak comparing with Deep Forest Ambush As you may remembered recently, there was an impulse set competition. One of my entries, which is under the History theme. The Deep Forest Ambush was firstly inspired by this set, and made an improvement out of it. Look at the improved tree compared with the orignal. Summary review Playability: 4/10 (Not much to play with, except swooshing around the Griffin) Design: 5/10 (Too simple and its defintely not related with the movie scene) Parts: 10/10 (Great for parts, explained by the review. A great deal of green and brown parts) Price: 9/10 (An inexpensive set based on the 2004 pricing) Overall: 7/10 (A must have for all Harry Potter fans and collectors whom needs a great use of green and brown parts) Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. More pictures can be found in My Brickshelf (When moderated) Let the Potter magic begans! Edited by WhiteFang, 09 June 2008 - 02:45 PM."

This Draco is the best TLC has made, if you ask me. The new one (also doubling for Belloq and ""guards"" in the Indy line) doesn't look quite as hautain as this one. Buckbeak looks cool.

Good work No printed face on the pumpkin since the event didn't happen on or near Halloween, unlike the whole troll situation I also agree that this Draco is the best one, the new one looks too much like a Draco from the oldr films, when he smirked a lot more, but, since very character got a redesign...They had to ""tune him up"" even if it meant changigng him for the worse"

Rather similar to LEGO horses. Well designed. Mr Spielbrick, thanks for pointing out some important highlights for the review. I have overlooked it earlier. I strongly agreed with you, that this Draco is the best TLC made. I pretty like the face compared to others. Furthermore, I used my multiple Dracos, for my castle armor guards instead. One could not have too many Dracos. Buckbeak design is well made. The head can be moved upwards and downwards. The mechanism is similar to the horse design. In addition, Buckbeak wings can be removed. Similar to the typical green or black dragon wings that we used to see in the past. Well, the main reason for me to buy this set was in fact Buckbeak. You don't often find a griffin lying around except in Harry Potter sets. Mr Spielbrick, on Jun 12 2008, 12:28 AM, said: The orange brick doesn't have a pumpkin face on it, right? Unlike the one from Philosopher's Stone in the set with the troll. Sorry to said, there is no print on that pumpkin face. It's pure orange."

I still have a few of them laying around unopened. I think I payed like under $5 for each and thats a great deal for all the variety of neat parts you get with this set.

I like the treemaking pieces the most of this not very expensive set. The Buckbeak fig is very nice and can bow his head like the horses. I was annoyed to get another Draco without some other not made figs (Pansy Parkinson for example). About the dark bley feathers; In the second version of Hogwarts there were several of these feathers put in little 1x1 cones like it was a feather to write with it. I bought 2 sets of these and when they were for sale I just bought +/- 6 more of it. Only annoying that I had then even a bigger army of Draco's.

The other day I picked up this gem for an okay sales price at Devonport, Tas, while searching for the new Batsets. I informed iamded of this as he is a Spidey-suckup ( ) and he informed me this was the only set he didn't have of the Wave 2 of this theme. So I ask you great EB members to please remind him of this when commenting! Here we go with the review of Doctopus' lair: Anyway, unlike other reviews, this stars more people, the Batbrick-iamded-dragonator-Daisy review! (Daisy is the mouse that came in the set) First up re the figs, and I must say they are great. I love fleshies and these are excellent to expand my Batman world, plus having a Spiderman to beat up is good too Doctopus is great, though his tentacles are annoying to keep in order. Peter Parker is a nice addition, I love that torso. Eve though Harry Osborn was totally absent from this scene, I welcome him as he is a good fig also. Best of all is Mary Jane, fleshie females are hard to come by and I love that hair, my very first one! Oh, and even better is bley Daisy on the far right: Another fantastic thing is that by mixing MJ with Doctopus you get a far more deadly and real villain than anyone could've forseen - The Hippy! Oh c'mon, tell me that ain't cool? Anyhoo, here is a pic of Doctopus showing his might: Random fact: Did you know I influence both dragonator and iamded in their sigfigs? dragonator adapts his from my IA series while iamded added Mutt hair when I had him like that in a pic I posted. Now onto the box, sorry about the lighting. The art is good and the cartoon spidey in the corner may have beenthe inspiration for a similar style in the new Batsets: Back of the box. Again, sorry about the lighting and blur, it was gtting late and these were the last pics: Finally we get to the first part of the set: The catapult. Is that movie accurate or what? I love the part in SM2 when he uses his homemade genetic spider powered catapult to launch himself to the scene! Oh well, it does comes with a cool spider web an trans blue spider, so it gets some points: And it is really fun! I launched spidey several metres once, I don't think he ever recovered. Infact, he almost certainly webbed himself Slightly cooler extras are these two. This awesome little boat is great for city, as is the simple but nice bouy, Daisy approves: Naturally dragonator ruins everything when he found out the ""dragon"" that would be riding with him was our nickname for Daisy Now finally, the main attraction - Coctopus' Dock. iamded and I threw dragonator in the water to see if he could swim. He er, couldn't One Sweeney todd later, we continue! The overall construction of the building is very good. I know a lot of people hated stickers and i hated applying these, but they do look spectacular and perfect for any City setting, like a bank, a Gotham Bank As iamded has already noted below me the black lifesavers a very cool as are the web piece and log pieces: The inside contains the neutron copperplate triple bypass humdrum holy hum 5000, which does does, see movie. Anyhoo, it is very cool, and includes a little control thingy on the yellow brick next to it. Unfortunately, the inside is plain but for that: The other side has no wall too which is a bit of a letdown really, but atleast it allows Daisy easy access. one gripe is those yellow 1x1 bricks, they serve no purpose and break up the colour scheme: Better shot of the thingy thing. I quite like it, the use of technic parts actually works, and the whole set is worth it for those purple flames and dishes alone It closes up pretty well too, unable to hit the dish which is a nice feature: Me and iamded liked it so much we threw a revived dragonator into it. Unfortunately it disagreed with him, but it was fun: Another shot of the dock. I like how they have gaps in the jetty, I know the movie version was pretty wack, and although the set isn't very faithful to it (looks more like a seaside library to be frank) it still is very nice. This is my first large blue baseplate too which is wonderful, though funny how the set only uses about half of it: The roof is a well designed and fun feature, it uses some technic connections to render it flexible of any degree, as you can see here by my opening of it: Better shot of the roof design, it can lie flat or at any angle. I might use the design myself in the future: As much as I love the building this feature bugs me, for in order for it to work this wall has to stick out, which not only looks ugly but makes you be able to see through the corners. Still, easily modded, and log pieces are fantastic for mocing. It also means that there are 7 windows all up for a good, sizeable building: By pulling out the piece in the center the walls both collapss sideways outwards, which is actually pretty fun and works everytime: Overall view of the set including characters: Now for the story that makes no sense....at all: Spiderman is dead after falling down the wall mechanism (see above): Only Daisy can save the day! For dragonator is being held by the evil Doctopus! And iamded and dragonator are too busy not caring! And Brainbox is too busy complaining that this goes against all Marvel continuity! Unfortunately Daisy is on a lunchbreak so tough luck dragonator: And Daisy goes on a search for fortune and glory: Okay, this is what I think of the set: Build: 3/5 - Fun, but those stickers ruin the experience somewhat, and if you don't apply them the instructions are a bit hard to follow. Playability: 4/5 - Great little gizmos and bits, not the kind that keep you going like with the 2007 Aquabase, but good fun still. Design: 4/5 - Not very movie faithful no, but still a great little building and a smart design for certain aspects. Minifigs: 5/5 - Great figs with all different faces and very useful bits. Price: 2/5 Far, FAR overpriced even on sale sadly Total: 18/25 - A good set that could've been better with a few minor changes. Nothing wrong with it, but it doesn't really cross the line to greatness. That said, it has a lot going for it and definitely worth buying or atleast a look! Thanks for reading Batbrick Away!

Product: 6205 V-wing Theme: Star Wars No of pieces: 118 Release Date: Feburary 2006 RRP: SGD29.90/USD9.90 Availability: Lego Shop@Home, Target, Toys 'R' Us (US & Europe), Bricksworld (SG). Lego.com said: Rule the spaceways! The sleek V-wing fighter can adapt to any situation! Position the wings and flaps in attack mode to protect Palpatine's shuttle from enemies. Or position the wings in flight mode to survey the area for intruders! Either way, the V-wing is ready to strike for the Republic. Includes Clone pilot and R4 droid. Position wings in attack or flight mode! Sorry to all for the delay, since this was supposed to be done 3 days ago. Anyway, to get on with it... Quite a minimal amount of baggies for this set, as noticed. And the best thing is... no sticker sheet. Yippee!! :bounce: The completed v-wing. Though not really a complaint, it would be nice if the entire astromech body was provided instead of only the head dome. :p Of course, then it wouldn't be movie-accurate, since the Q7 series astro-mech is integrated with the starfighter. :lol: He's definitely well-painted for a simple mini-fig. Since even the back is painted too. I have to assumed this is the same mini-fig provided for 7259 ARC-170 Starfighter too, since I don't have that set. Anyway, this mini-fig is much more accurate for this v-wing since his suit is rated against vacuum, while those in the arc-170 aren't . :p One thing that's lacking is the instruments panel in the cockpit... it's totally non-existent here. I wonder what went wrong during the design stage. Personally... this is the second most anticipated set for 2006, the first being the tie interceptor, for me. One thing is that there's no known release of the V-wing starfighter by hasbro, nor the other well-known brands. The other thing is that being a star wars vehicle collector, I would really loved to see a replica toy of the V-wing. And the V-wing by the Lego Group does not disappoint... it's nearly movie-accurate, except for the cockpit transparisteel cover which could used some paint like the x-wing's. Also, there's a permanent landing gear that quite neat, since it allows you to land the craft on uniform surfaces. The s-foils on the other hand can be quite a pain to pose into flight position. Very difficult for the s-foils to remain symmetrical during play. The ""swoosh-able"" or play factor of this product is quite good... just check out the pics for yourself... :D *Crackle* General Skywalker, we have incoming! To conclude, the v-wing starfighter would make a much better companion to the Eta-2 Actis Interceptor (Jedi Starfighter), than the arc-170. Coz the arc-170 seems more like a long-range bomber to me, than a snub-fighter. :p And a final pic to show it at rest... Comments (For 2008) Just an updated pic to show my latest display on the clone wars Hmm... off the record, I do understand that sometimes, reviews by most tend to a certain set of guidelines like naming the set, and showing the boxed, and out of boxed pics, and of course, the grading portion. Regarding my review, I prefer not to grade any of the lego sets at all as far as possible, because to each, his/her own. My reasons to put up a review is not to belittle the efforts of TLG in coming out with these products nor to help them market them, but to show my appreciation and enjoyment of these products. I hope noone is offended by this, and would like to apologise for any misunderstanding that this may caused. For those who do not understand the above paragraph, care not for it and Play On! Like Me"

Hope you guys enjoy them so far. Product: 6206 Tie Interceptor Theme: Star Wars No of pieces: 212 Release Date: February 2006 RRP: SGD39.90/USD19.90 Availability: Lego Shop@Home, Target, Toys 'R' Us (US & Europe), Bricksworld (SG). Lego.com said: Challenge the Rebels! Blasting out of Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi, the TIE Interceptor is the fastest fighter in the Imperial fleet! Open the cockpit canopy and fold down the instrument panel to put the TIE pilot inside and recreate your favorite classic Star Wars battles! Includes TIE fighter pilot! Cockpit opens and instrument panel folds down! It does seem to have more pieces than the average tie fighter, but this is actually cheaper than the 7263 TIE Fighter. Of course, there's no light-up feature in this set. :sweat: YesH!! Finally... A... Tie Interceptor!! This is probably the most anticipated for all set for all lego tie collectors worldwide, since the fighter, bomber, advanced, and even the Expanded Universe droid fighter had been released by the Lego Group. This set is near movie-accurate, since the bottom part of it ain't. :p The cockpit and pylons uses the same design as that of the tie advanced piloted by Darth Vader. Except for one minor change, that is the aft interior of the cockpit is strengthen this time. And this is indeed good news, since the older models had a problem of hard hinge and loose brick connection. There's no landing gear for this set, but it doesn't require it anyway. This tie interceptor balances perfectly on its wings. Standard instruments panel and, of course, standard imperial pilot. The ""swoosh-able"" or play factor of this set is definitely very high... Just take a look. :D *Camera view from own craft* *Camera view from Tie-Advanced* *Combat simulation of Endor's Battle from the archives* No bomber, since I started late in re-collecting. :p To conclude, for a typical lego fan, this set is a 60/40, 60 due to it's good design, and for a typical star wars fan, this is a must-get. The only flaw for this set is the same flaw for any lego set in SG, the price. :doh: Comment(Current in 2008) Being a starwars fan... no... being a typical toy collector, space is definitely a premium... so much so that I turned to lego starwars to sate my appetite for more starwars products when I already have no more display space. For the next few non-lego pictures, they are the crown of my starfighter collection in 1/18 scale. So just view them for fun, eh? And no, I haven't had the chance nor the time to do up a scene of my lego starfighters blowing up spectacularly since the pieces would be very hard to put back... Hmm... then again, isn't that what lego is about. ""doH""."

The box The back of the box shows the two alternate models you can build if the polybags rip. There are 3 cheese slopes and two 1x2 tiles that glow in the dark, where the tiles are exclusive for this set. The total parts count is high at 142, but there are no really big pieces among them. Inside the box you will find the building instructions, a sheet with some odd sticky labels (thrown away) and 3 polybags marked by the bag building difficulty. The models The lime colored car doesn't bring out anything new. We have seen racers built like that before, but it does contain some nice bricks for the collection. The police cruiser surprises with an interesting design along the sides as seen here. It is harder to build because of the greater level of details: The helicopter is without doubt the hardest vehicle to build in a bag. I can't finish it because it's larger than the bag. You can't put on the top blades nor the tail of the thing, so it beats the forklift from 7733 where the top bar is the new kind that doesn't completely fit. There is also instructions for the alternate models, but it requires the bags to be opened... The vehicles are pretty standard for the racers theme with the police car being the highlight of the set Conclusion I like the difficulty curve between bag 1 and 2, but the last bag should be labeled 1000000 instead of 3. It requires some inhuman skills to build that helicopter in the bag... ? Lime colored car: 3 - We have seen it before, but it has some nice pieces... and lime. Police Cruiser: 9 - It has a massive diffusers, rare parts and a high level of details. It is a shame LEGO relies so much on stickers. Helicopter: 6 - if you see it as a set for one fourth of the price of the cars, it is quite amazing, but you can't bag build it and I would personally prefer some more detail instead of the big size. Overall it is a nice little set, but the police car is the main attraction. I wouldn't get the other vehicles if they were sold separately.

Here is my review for LEGO set 10178 Motorized walking AT-AT Because I live in the UK I got this set with 6 free duracell batteries which was great! (It's just twice as expensive as the US) Heres the basic set that is from the instructions. This is the cockpit but please note after I took this photo I realised it was slightly built wrong. Heres one of the feet in proportion to a minifig to give you a general size. This is Luke Skywalker swinging on a wire trying to destroy the AT-AT I really wish LEGO didn't make so many Luke's because I want differnt minifigs. It would also be nice for a thermal detonator piece. Underneath the AT-AT you can see the shaft that moves the back legs, the motor and squeezed in on the righ t the massive battery box. A load of cogs that move the legs. These are the included figures Snowtrooper, General Maximilian Veers, AT-AT Driver/Pilot or whatever you want to call him and Luke all whithout there wepons. please note Veers should have a dark stone snowtroooper torso with 4 red and blue badge things not 3. These are the figures with weapons I gave them and the included ones Snowtrooper has new style blaster, Veers has Standard light grey pistol like the ones from the old adventure sets, AT-AT driver has old style blaster which I call heavy Blaster and Luke has SHINY HANDLE blue Light Sabre . The Shiny blue light sabre was included with the set which is a bonus because i really dont like the grey ones. http://www.brickshel...sc00521.jpg.jpg This is the switch which is attached to the battery box on either side of the AT-AT underneath the lift up side panels. you push the forward to walk forward and backward to walk backwards simple eh . A front veiw with the the panels open. Here are the Drivers controls which are simply a cotrol panel and 2 exo-force robot hands which are joystick things seen in the film if you look closley. The almost useless carry handle. This is the weird back piece. Looking down the AT-AT from the back where you can see the the battery box and switch. Troops decending from ropes and cables and Vader leading the assult for this I hadnt got any more imp's so I used Clones Pilots. (I now have a whole load more snowtroopers) Solo and Chewie sabotaging. More troops to squash rebel scum huzahh! A very bad picture of everyone packed up inside. The size incomparison to its predecessor Overall I would give this set 9/10 because it should come with more snowtroopers or it could be and Endor version with loads of strormies and scout troopers. Aswell as this you can really sit any one down because of the battery box but I stilll find space to put all the shown figures on this review in the interior as you can see on the above image the chains and ropes are hanging down a bit. Tjis set is now limited to 5 per customer in the UK and now no longer comes with free batteries. The walking on this is a bit wonky and dosen't really walk like they do in the film as it moves two legs at a time. I am currently attaching a motor to the head to make it move independently."

Me:""Goodbye"" [pushes the incinerator button] Ph4tDuD3:""wut?! nooooooooooooooooooo..........."" and on that note, let's start the reivew of the UCS DEATH STAR II. Now this is an older set (2005) and I've only gotten around to buying it a short while ago. It took me around 2 evenings to build it and I must say that I am fairly impressed by this set. Time for a box pic: The Build: Since I started building this huge (small moon size) set at Morten's appartment, I wanted to keep as few polybags open at any given time as possible. With this set it is actually possible to have a minimum of bricks scattered over a table or two while building. Not sure why, but the division of bricks in the different polybags just work very well. And that is great with a set this size - 3441 bricks. The building of the set is divided into several ""Build this times x"". For example the upper and lower part of the ""unshielded"" DS are completely alike. This is difficult to see when looking at the model, but heaven when building it: And this is how they solved the problem of having the wings connected to the buttom of the Death Star - geniously done IMO: Note that in the first pic the ""skeleton"" is easily seen. ""The skeleton"" holds the X to which both the upper and lower part is ""clicked"" on with technic pins. Also there's a steering wheel (I'm sure there's a pirate name for that ) like the one in the bottom, in the top of the model to hold the upside ""wings"". So after having build duplicate wings (upper and lower), the ""belt"" (all the way around the star) and the upper and lower part of the ""unshielded"" side, it was time to step back and watch the Death Star II in all it's glory: Such a great UCS set. Now I did have a few ""huh's"" during the build: HUH! #1 In the instruction the technic lesser-dragon-head should be dark grey, but I got it in light gray. Go figure and thank you replacement parts. I've experienced this before and apparently TLG uses different colours when ""out-of-stock"". All one has to do is call them and ask for the right colour and it's on it's way Still a HUH! experience. HUH! #2 Again it appears that TLG changed the design of the technic axleholed 1x2 bricks. The bottom has changed and I got the set where it was mixed up between ""old"" and ""new"" version. Not that annoying, but still got me perplexed as to: ""Am I doing this right?"" Kinda stressing to consider taking most of the star apart to check the remaining 231 technic bricks 1x2 with axlehole. Now for a verdict: : 1: looks great 2: even my ""wife"" likes it - female appeal 3: it's a great build 4: the polybags work for you 5: it's Star Wars 6: the design is awesome : 1: it wobbles if you touch it 2: very small parts come off, if you touch it 3: parts come off when you try to move it somewhere safe 4: zero swooshability So in short (yes even shorter]: The DSII is a well designed UCS set that has a great design. Like most other UCS sets, it is not meant for play - hence don't play with it. UCS verdict (the numbers) 5/10 (design++/instructions+-/bricks+-/sturdiness--/colourscheme+-) design: awesome look and great greeble set instructions: easy to follow steps with bricks mentioned hard to see wether it's black or dark grey bricks: loads of great bricks a zillion bricks of the same type sturdiness: DON'T TOUCH colouscheme: grey in grey with a little touch of black Need a missing instruction? Then click the logo"

I actually don't like this set that much. It takes about 5 hours and 15 minutes to build if you do it in one go, but the repeating sections makes this built the most tedious I have experienced. It has way too many holes from which you can see the colorful skeleton and is overpriced compared to the older 10030 ISD. I remember thinking it was too expensive when it was 50% off at S@H! Even the Snowspeeder was ""kewler"" to less than half the price:"

Unless you really really want it and have nothing better to spent your $$$ on, in that case go for it. But in my case, it was a very repetitive build and final model was quite... well, bland, not must variety to it, if you know what i mean.for the price, i would really reccomend the UCS star destroyer, because thats a much better story.."

Sure, its great on display, but the build looks extremley boring to me, just stacking plate after plate. And as you said, its going to break a little if you touch it. The only intersting part for me is the firing laser. Although i do have to say the proce isnt too bad, i still wouldt buy it. And no minifigs so thanks for the review, but ill pass on this one. The new minifig scale DS looks awesome though, and this might have hyped some up who are buying the new DS,"

I don't agree that the ISD is better - IMHO they're exactly them same - big and grey This is a question of personal liking - which is the coolest DS or ISD. Not comparative.

I didn't think it was particularly fragile. I don't care about minifigs or playability either. A few plusses: in my opinion it looked pretty damn impressive sitting in my LEGO room and the construction is really clever. All in all, I actually liked this one, but perhaps I have a different expectation of sets than most of you. Sets are mainly parts packs and would you look at the quantity of grey plate in this thing! (It's new grey BTW). I paid half price for it at shop@home UK, which is still a _lot_ more than half price from the US, and I didn't regret it for a second. Cheers, Ralph"

I recently picked up this set, and I looked up this review to see what I was getting into. Not good news. The silver lining is that it was a ""Damaged box"" deal at Brickworld, so it only cost me $100 (half off the already lowered price) so it was definatley worth it as a parts pack, if nothing else. It's the last unopened/unbuilt ""large"" kit in my collection, so even if it is repetetive, I am going to build it anyway. It is likely however that I may substitute pieces to do away with the colored interior. I've already determined that after it sits on display for a while, I want to do a Zepplin as an alternate build. Looking at the parts list it looks like its the perfect set for such an undertaking."

This baby provides an amazing backdrop to any Lego inspired Star Wars diorama. And lets face it Lego tends to be a rectangular brick and somehow we now have a sphere!!! Guys... its a UCS. It accurately depicts the on screen icon and put plain and simple is a wonderful sculptural piece of work in its own right. I agree with KimT in that the removal of the laser and Super Star Destroyer gives it more authenticity but to call it a gray golf ball or ignore its inherent accuracy is simply to miss the point. It proved to be the best build to share with someone, be it family or friend due, to its repeated sections and impressive finish. Its a clever build and to criticize it for lack of playability or (I suspect for many) its absence of minifigs is just absurd and possibly why Lego has not released a proper UCS in nearly two years. I reckon many out there would love a UCS Tyderium, Imperial Walker or Slave 1 with a spectacular piece count be it minifig scale or just darn impressive in its own right. Sadly for those who love these sculptural masterpieces we're stuck with simple toys with 'play features' and cute minifigs. Clever in their own right but lacking the clout and purity of the old UCS line. Let's hope some diversity of product is just around the corner else 10179 was the last of the truly brave financial gambles of the Star Wars line...."

This is my first review, so contstructive critisism is very much appreciated! On to the review: First, we start out with the box: The box art is the same as always since 2006. nothing special. Then we start the build. The build is fairly easy, and will take the seasoned builder about 15-20 min to complete. Here is the finished model: and bird's eye view: As you can see, this ship is very sleek. The fins or ""wings"" each have an outer slope and an inner one, with the guns in between. There are also cones on the front of the fins, which give the ship an even more sleek look. In the middle of the wings there is the main body, with a big slope and stripes decorating it. This set has a very good playability factor, as I'm about to show you now. The guns on the ship are pretty cool looking to begin with; a bley slope attaching a lightsaber hilt and a trans-neon green stud to the fin on each side. But theres more than what meets the eye: Yes, the guns flip up! ...and they can flip all the way back to hide them, for whatever case they need hiding. Lets have a look at the back, there is a tail fin used as landing gear and some lightspeed boosters: But wait... The tail fin can flip up for flight thanks to a hinge attached to the back of the cockpit. Heres another playability factor: The cockpit can slide open very smoothly and easily. Heres how this is possible: A clever system under the hood allows the cockpit to open. See those two bley pieces on the black ones? Those bley ones attach to the tan plates under the hood, and the hood and windsheild attach to the black peices. The black and bley pieces work together as a sliding system, so the cockpit opens. Viola! And then the cockpit snaps in place thanks to the red hook and clip. Its a very accurate system, and works very well. You'll want to open and close it over and over again! Now, finnaly to the fig: The General himself. A very impressive fig, with a new head and torso mold. In this set, (which is one of only two with Greivous in it) he comes with 2 green and two blue lightsabers, all with bley hilts ( ). I was hoping for chrome hilts, but its a minor fault. Grievous also comes with a new mold pistol blaster (not pictured). Heres the General in the cockpit (sadly a weak cockpit, no details): He just half lays down on a small slope. In this set, he doesnt come with a cape beacuse with it on, the cockpit doesnt close. Thats about it, heres the... FINAL VERDICT: Build: 7/10 Fairly easy but fun. A little bit weak. Playability: 8/10 Many playability factors, but some are boring or pointless. Swooshability: 8/10 very fun to fly around, sometimes pieces break off. Minifigs: 10/10 one amazing fig with 4 lightsabers and a new blaster. what more could you ask for? Design: 9/10 very sleek, but hardly any real texture. i like it, but others might want greebling. Price: 10/10 Overall Score: 9/10 A very cool ship with a very cool minifig and accessories. One of the best SW sets I have ever seen for its small price I highly recommend it to any kind of SW, LEGO, or SW LEGO fan. Hope you enjoyed my review, please leave feedback!

But if you hold it in your palm or from the sides, it wont break. Emphasis on sometimes. But dont try to mess around with it by removing its pieces or adding new one, or modding it in any way, because the sliding mechanism wont agree with the mods and break.

I bought this set earlier ago, and will like to share this comprehensive review with everyone of you. Name: Troll Warrior Theme: LEGO System / Castle Year: 2008 Pieces: 19 Minifigs: 1 An image of a 5618, Troll Warrior Let the march begin The mighty brave troll warrior, carrying a dangerous cart equipped with a ""flick"" fire missile. Marching into the lands of the Crown Kingdom. Crown Knights must be ready for this new troll addition. From what I see, this set has a very minimum piece count since it's an impulse set. There is no unique parts found in this set. However, this set has a couple of useful accessories, such as 2 spears and 2 wooden wheels and a grey mouse running around. This set is another alternative for Castle Army builders to buy multiple sets, to build a massive Troll armies. In addition, the flick missile really works. Use a little bit of force from your finger and flick it, the missile will fly. Well, it certainly does not impress me at all with such playing feature. Base of the cart Different angles There is one thing I dislike about this set. The wooden wheels are too big, and it is the same as the ones in the Crossbow attack. I prefer the smaller wheels that exist in old castle sets that produced smaller cart. Since this cart size is similar to the old cart size. The old wizard's cart is a very good example of the proposed wheel. Bits and Pieces Close-up on the warrior and the mouse Summary review Playability: 5.5/10 (The playability feature is not fanastic.) Design: 6.5/10 (Design is adequate. If the wheels is much smaller and the flicking thing disappear, the score will be much higher) Price: 8/10 (An inexpensive set to get a troll warrior and a mouse.) Overall: 6/10 (To conclude, this set is good only for army builders. A new range of millitary vehicle to be added. That's all) Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine.

Bearing in mind that the whole point of this set is to get a cheap troll warrior, I actually quite like it. The cart isn't brilliant, but for 13 pieces it's not that bad. The troll fig is great as always, and I guess the rats are always nice to get (not so much in real life though). The sets that contain the trolls have a fairly solid number each (I mean, Tower Raid has three!), but nevertheless I think I may have to pick up a few of these.

Bearing in mind that the whole point of this set is to get a cheap troll warrior, I actually quite like it. The cart isn't brilliant, but for 13 pieces it's not that bad. The troll fig is great as always, and I guess the rats are always nice to get (not so much in real life though). The sets that contain the trolls have a fairly solid number each (I mean, Tower Raid has three!), but nevertheless I think I may have to pick up a few of these. Norro, on Jul 3 2008, 06:10 AM, said: A more affordable troll warrior for those of us avoiding the large sets (me) is always nice! Thanks for the review! I must agreed with the both of you, that this is a much easier way to acquire these troll warriors at a much affordable price. I am glad these trolls are available in Impulse sets. Now, will there will be a dwarf impulse set in the future? I supposed that will be much interesting. G.L.MAN, on Jul 3 2008, 12:15 AM, said: Its a good review but you forgot another thing.

If this impulse set includes a troll shield, my rating will defintely go higher. This is a troll army builder set, with minimum feature and limited weapons range. If the troll comes with an armor or a shield, I will think this set is worth it. Troll armor is hard to get by, as it appeared only in Troll Warship and Tower Raid.

Give the new theme a chance. I feel TLG have made an effort to revive certain elements that are present in past castle themes. Although it is not as good as the past, but it is certainly better than the recent castle themes. Shoc, on Jul 4 2008, 01:00 AM, said: Why is mouse friendlier than rat? Well, mouse sounded more friendly, because it can associate with Tom and Jerry. But, calling it a rat equal calling it a pest.. It's just a matter of putting it in different terms. That's all. Edit: Instead of posting another post to explain why I used mouse. I will write it here. Tom and Jerry is reflected as a cartoon. Children associate Jerry as a mouse, since its supposed to be heart-warming and make us laugh. In real life, there are many different pets we raised. One of the possible pets we considered is a mouse. Mouse are supposed to be shy and friendly creatures that live in harmony. While rats lived in packs, hunt food in the dark and is widely regarded as a ""pest"". In this review, I am trying to illustrate rat and associate it with mouse by presenting it in a much friendly approach. There is no right or wrong answer. It's just making use of different words to represent how I feel towards a particular thing. Edited by WhiteFang, 04 July 2008 - 08:08 AM."

There you have a minifig, enough weapons and armor for two figs and a weapons rack made out of basic pieces. Add a generic fig from your collection and you have two knights and the pieces from the rack can be easily used in MOCs. The pieces that make up the siege weapon in the Orc impulse are not as easy to use in other creations. I'd rather have seen a ""Orcish"" weapons rack (different from the Knights rack, but like it, using basic elements) with a second helmet, another weapon, the Orc armor and a shield to put on it. Still, although not as good as the Knight impulse, it's a nice little set. WhiteFang, on Jul 4 2008, 03:43 AM, said: Tom and Jerry is reflected as a cartoon.

I was pretty excited when I laid my hands on these new impulse sets yesterday. Hope to give most of you a good insight for this set. Name: Street Cleaner Theme: LEGO System / Town / City Year: 2008 Pieces: 22 Minifigs: 1 An image of a 5620, Street Cleaner Let the cleaning begin The Street Cleaner has a job to do. It is to clean the rubbish on the streets, after a New Year Countdown. It seemed the cleaning agency have a new equipment to use. It's not as big as the previous street sweeper machine. The cleaner will need to operate the equipment manually, by pushing it. Look at the mess After sorting out Look at the pieces offered. It's not a very complicated set, since it's an impulse set. There are some pretty useful parts lying around such as the broom, spade. However, I was quite surprised when I could not find the lid of the rubbish bin. I can't used this rubbish bin to place it around my town, without a lid on top of it. I believed it is not a norm, by not including the lid. Look at that bin Well, that rubbish bin seem to be containing his equipment in it, instead of the rubbish. The cleaner's face looks pretty sad. I think he wants to have a change of job. Front View I love that blue brush very much. Quite fun to play with, especially pushing the rubbish aside. That's why a spade is there to help him to dig out the litter and the broom to brush it away. Ok, now I know why his face looks so sad! Where is that Street Sweeper machine? Summary review Playability: 6.5/10 (Not bad to play with) Design: 7.5/10 (The design is relatively interesting, with the use of the technic part, to be its foundation.) Price: 8/10 (An inexpensive set to get another cleaner and some neat accessories.) Overall: 7/10 (Not a bad set after all. Pretty average, but still quite good to buy if your towns required more cleaners.) Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. Comments and Critics are strongly welcomed.

This will be the third review at a go. Hope everyone of you will find this review useful in a way. Name: Coast Guard Kayak Theme: LEGO System / Town / City Year: 2008 Pieces: 21 Minifigs: 1 An image of a 5621, Coast Guard Kayak Roll Roll, Roll your boat It seemed the coast guard has a kayak of his own, roaming in the sea, making sure that swimmers will be safe in the beach. Now, I am illustrating him as a life guard instead. This set is simply wonderful. Among the 4 new impulse sets, Coast Guard Kayak is the best looking set in my opnion. The kayak design is very simple but looks realistic . Furthermore, if you don't need it to be a coast guard kind of stuff. Use it as a leisure water spot instead down in the marina. I will think any LEGO citizen will love to have some water spot in their busy life. So come down here and wind down with this new sport. Bits and Pieces Kayak and the bouy The bouy is very useful to position it at the coast of your water to highlight the boundaries in the sea, and warning incoming ships or vessels. Oh, I did not make it tilted purposely. There is a white round base which allow it to tilt on both ends. Useful parts These parts are useful to add on in your city. Somehow, when I see that red cone, I can use it as a police stop, to inspect vehicles on the road or form a barricade with it. The bouy base shape is unique too. I like it very much. It is great to attached it by the side of the boat as a life bouy. The coast guard's life vest and helmet are very useful for water activites. The life vest was produced in past sets, and now it re-surfaced again. I am glad these vests made their way back. A look of him, without the life vest Summary review Playability: 7.5/10 (Fun to play with, especially the bouy when you see it moving up and down.) Design: 8.5/10 (Design is simple but straight to the point, especially the kayak design.) Price: 8/10 (An inexpensive set to get more coast guards and more kayaks.) Overall: 8.5/10 (A very good set to have in your LEGO town. The kayak is simply so lovely to me.) Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine.

Hope everyone of you will find my reviews useful and helpful in your purchase. Name: Crystal Hawk Theme: LEGO System / Mars Mission Year: 2008 Pieces: 26 Minifigs: 1 An image of a 5619, Crystal Hawk Alpha 3 in Sector 5, reporting to base Alpha 3, Crystal Hawk, reporting for duty, Sir! May I present Mars Mission, latest scout craft, code named ""Crystal Hawk"". This spacecraft looks very sleek and cool with its usual white and orange color combination. I am not a fan of Mars Mission, but these white mini-figs simply attracted me for it. In fact, I only owned its impulse sets, and none of its main sets. Nevertheless, this set has the ""swoosh"" factor. I was swooshing around in my home last night. Well, I am not swooshing it like KimT though. Am I seeing double? Haha, the answer is ""No"". It has double sided face. I combined the pictures, to illustrate the two facial expressions. Bits and Pieces Different angles Love the way how the wings bend upwards and downwards. The only thing I find it a little bit wierd for spacecraft. Normally, I thought joystick is the typical navigation controls for a spacecraft instead of a steering wheel? I am not complaining about a steering wheel in a spacecraft. To me, it's quite an uncommon sight. Anyway, the white steering wheel is an useful part for making vehicles MOCs. Summary review Playability: 8/10 (Fun to play with when you bend the wings up and down.) Design: 8.5/10 (Design is simple, but creates a sleek and cool look.) Price: 8/10 (An inexpensive set to get more scout craft and mars mission mini-figs) Overall: 8.5/10 (A very good set to have for any Mars Mission fans, and for collectors like me whom can't afford all Mars Mission sets, this set is a very great alternative.)

Sinner, sorry I had just noticed this particular response. I thought the total amount of parts presented in a typical impulse set should be between 30 pieces count or less, including the minifig? Crystal Hawk is made up of 21 parts, while the minifig's parts add up to 5 parts which consist of its legs, torso, head, helmet and visor. There may not be a clear definition of an impulse set structure. I am just curious on how you managed to derived this formula.

In 1987, the Mayor of LEGOLAND accidentally crashed his car into a fence outside of town. The incident was a bit suspicious, but the Mayor claimed that his dizzyness had been caused by over-the-counter allergy medicine and the police quickly closed the case. That, however, wasn't the end of the story. Having been forced to stumble walk a full 3 blocks back to town, the Mayor was tremendously concerned about his inconvenience public safety and vowed that this would never happen again. As a result, the LEGOLAND Highway Department added the Emergency Repair Truck to the fleet a week later and placed it under the watchful eye of his lazy brother a valued member of the community. The Emergency Repair Truck cruises the roads and highways of LEGOLAND, bringing much needed help to stranded motorists and occasionally picking up the Mayor's dry cleaning. Let's take a look at this important little vehicle. The typically folded instructions make quick work of the assembly. You could be on the road in 10 minutes or less if you simply follow them, step by step. The left side of the vehicle, including his mounted wrench/spanner. The right side of the vehicle, including his mounted mallet/hammer. The Highway Department Emergency Serviceman steps out to show you that this truck, 4-wide though it may be, still features a convenient door for him to exit from. He holds his favourite wrench/spanner, which is something of a trademark item in his line of work. His jacket features the Highway Department logo, a zipper, and a convenient pocket. Here you see the printed pieces, which come in the form of the Highway logo on a pair of side panels and a picture of his wrench/spanner on a 1x4 tile attached to the roof alongside emergency lights and a radio antenna. When you see this bright yellow beauty coming, you know that help has arrived. *starts the movie projector* Now, let's take a look at a day in the life of a Highway Department Emergency Serviceman. After a long lunch, our intrepid hero sets out in search of motorists in distress. As he rounds the curve at the end of System Dr, he see a woman standing with her horse. As he is about to pass her, he notices how attractive she is, and decides to back up and talk to her. They appear to be in distress! And she's attractive! Er. She needs help! Yes, that's it! He immediately pulls over and approaches the woman, hoping to be able to assist her in her plight. Excuse me ma'am, I couldn't help but notice that you seem to need some help. Oh yes, that would be lovely. I'm looking for Forestman's Crossing. Forestman's Crossing? I've never heard of it. I'm sorry, ma'am. No matter, we'll find it, it must be around here someplace. Did you try that shelf over there? *points* Excellent idea, lad, thank you so much! Bye! And there you have it, another motorist citizen helped. Just another day in the life of one of those unsung heroes of LEGOLAND, the Highway Department Emergency Serviceman. What will he do tomorrow? His job, of course, after a long lunch. Where will it take him? Anywhere he's needed on the streets of LEGOLAND. Thank you for joining me! *turns off the projector* Featuring useful parts, including 3 that are printed, a nice printed minifigure that hadn't appeared very often previously, and a couple of handy tools, this set offers a lot at what must have been a very small price. I'd give it a 10/10 and be happy to buy several of them today, if they were available. If you would like to make your own Hero of the Highways™, you could use the blue torso decal from the Classic-Town Decal Library, or, if you'd like to make some coworkers for him in different branches of the Highway Department, you could try some of these never-before-seen unofficial colour variations.

Bought 5 auctions from the same seller, but the others were all Classic Space and Castle (and about $4 a pop ). The three printed pieces are absolutely perfect, as is the minifig, so I was very happy, even without a box. Now the problem is, that's all of my currently assembled Classic Town, aside from a couple of Paradisa sets that Alice also has and will be doing (heck, one of them is the one Hinck plans to do too, so I don't think we need 3 reviews of it, even with the pony ). That forestwoman was from a $20 buy that included the whole set and all the minifigs from Forestman's Crossing and a pile of other sets worth no less than $100+ easy. I'm currently searching for more deals, and will review anything I can buy cheap."

FLASHBACK: This was an awesome set in the early 80s. I was really drawn to the trans. green pieces, esp. considering that all previous space sets used the trans. yellow for windshields and windows.

It offered a great amount of playability having a command center, an early monorail (for lack of a better name), a moon buggy, and small space craft. Unique elements included the replacement of standard yellow bricks with trans. yellow windows, a black laser gun, a clear minifig cup, and a Classic Space flag, to name just a few. The set was so fun as a kid. Now on to the review. The instructions: The baskside of the instructions. Notice how the picture keeps including more sets (compared to earlier sets): The set includes four figs, still just white and red: A moon buggy that has a clip for attaching a wrench or walkie-talkie: One of the nicest components of this set is this small space craft: A different view: The ship takes off from this landing platform which lifts up: A small monorail system from the Command Base takes two figs at a time to the platform: A close-up of the two seated manual monorail: Notice also the great classic space flag. The decals are original. And here's the Command Center: The radar system on top: Inside the command center are two rotating chairs, two beds, table, and accessories: The left side has a large printed display screen (different from the one included within the Space Command Center #493): A close-up of the right side: Here's a shot at a different angle. I always liked the clear cup. It's too bad that the other minifigs have to share: The backside.

So far this year he's had a plethora of vehicles released but nowhere to call home. Thankfully with the advent of 8637 he finally has a lair to call his own. Featuring built-in thermal heating, the Volcano Base is warm and cosy all year round! It's also a tastefully themed pad in shades of trans orange, dark brown, orange and lime, although the interior decoration is a little lacking. For security reasons, the architect had to be thrown into the built-in firepit so as not to reveal the base's secrets, but join us on our leisure tour of the must-see anti-hero holiday house of 2008 - viva the Volcano Base! Part 1: From out of the box Front view: Back view: Manuals: Random instruction page: 2 x DSSs: Polybagged goodness: Parts unveiled! I love to swirl everything together in one big mess, it reminds me of how I built as a kid. BURPy-LURPy goodness - 5 large red brown ones and 4 of the smaller trans-orange ones. This set is a bonanza for landscaping . Part 2: Minifigs and Agents Jet Nothing new with the Agents and their confusing rhyming names - Agents Chase and Trace are obviously destined to be together and have several kids called Lace, Case and Mace. Agent Fuse sends most of his time in this set indulging in a little light bondage - see handcuffs - which is a nice change after the sexist Mission 4 had Agent Trace chained to the shark buoy. Good to see gender equality, TLC! Three villians - two new ones - the deadly Claw-Dette and Fire-Arm. It's always good to have another Dr Inferno, although compulsory arm-replacement seems to be a mark of loyalty to the great man, as all three figs here have the modified cyber-hands. Fire-Arm is a bit of a waste as the giant gun just looks ludicrous - but what do I know, after weeks of knowing about this fig, I only just got the pun 'fire-arm' = 'firearm' . Claw-Dette is a vision of loveliness, the Irina hair fits perfectly, and how wonderful that TLC has given us *another* female torso for this line. That's 2 female minifigs in a non S@H exclusive set! Worlds may implode! The new face is nice, with just a hint of lime green eyeshadow - now that's scary . The jet: I didn't like the jet from the pics, but the build is a fun one and it looks good. The technic axle, when pushed, releases a net. This function works better than I thought it would. On the box art they show this net dropping onto the villain controlling the fire-pit, but how tangling someone in a web is going to stop Agent Fuse from turning into Agent Flambe is beyond me. This is one of those rare situations when one of those Fire helicopters so beloved of the City designers would actually be useful! Underside showing net in position: Part 3: Volcano Day! This set has been one of the most anticipated of the year for me, mainly because of the great concept, well-executed design and wonderful landscaping. It is also a treasure trove for parts enthusiasts. Apart from the BURPs, there's 43 large dark brown slopes, 23 smaller dark brown slopes, 19 1x1 trans orange bricks, 45 small orange slopes, 13 trans orange cheese pieces and a smattering of metallic silver . The colours all work well together to form the rocky mountain sides and give a real depth and play of light to the set - I'm glad they released this in a year where we now have dark brown, as it wouldn't look nearly as good in all red-brown or with black instead. The colours are really textured, and the intricate cascading lava slopes add a real MOC feel to the set. It's hard to tell from the pics, but the lava flows that start in the midsection actually match up with the left and right 'wings' of the volcano when the base is closed up (see further below for pic). Indeed, this is one of those sets that actually looks good when photographed with an overbright flash as the trans-orange flares into life! (The rest of this review uses natural light though.) Closer view of the midsection: The front door is really well designed with metallic silver teeth (as seen on the box art for Turbocar Chase). They click neatly into place when closed. Behold above, the throne of Dr Inferno! Yes, it's in a bit of a weird spot. They could have at least elevated it so he could gloat *over* intruders. The interior is the weakest part of this set, as we shall see. Choc-orange lava goodness atop the midsection - so pretty: Behold, Dr Inferno's enormous.... laser cannon, naturally. He rides this baby like a pro . The lime green is an unusual colour choice but the bright, cartoony feel really adds to the set as a whole and is much better than a standard bley/ black type superweapon. Next season's look in devastating WMDs: hot pink! (Maybe.) And yes, it rotates 360 degrees: And because Batbrick wondered about it in another thread, here's a pic with the laser folded down. Hardly discreet. Maybe you don't notice it what with all the magma and steam and flames etc. View of the firepit side of the mountain. The part selection is really nice, notice the silver radar dish. The sticker control panel display has a countdown from 12 seconds. This connects to the firepit, with a little gliding platform to travel between the two: Notice the decals on the chairs - a classy touch. Kudos to Dr Inferno's upholsterer. There's some great detail in this set which I really appreciate. For example, the chairs are built on the base, which has 2 1x3 orange plates assymetrically arranged. You wouldn't even notice this, and there's no reason for it, it's just a quirly little design touch which adds to the build - see below. Note also, there's a 1x1 round lime green plate on the firepit mechanism - nowhere else does this element appear in the set, and they could have easily used some other colour, but it adds a nice touch that says the designers have really put in as much originality as they can. The right-hand side of the mountain (looking front on): Close-up of the oddly protruding giant flatscreen monitor. Maybe Dr Inferno has really bad eyesight but for vanity's sake won't wear glasses, hence the need for a giant plasma screen to help aim his laser cannon . Again, the lime green and orange works well. They don't show this on the box or instructions, but the 'wings' of the volcano can fold in for a more defensive, mountainous look: Part 4: Interior decorating Sadly, the interior is the weakest part of the set, with a sparse selection of goodies. What's there is also mostly stickered. Compared to the bright, light facade, the whole of this section is very industrial and dark. Over all view: Middle section, with throne and stickered display screens: The laser section does have 2 cool power cone type things, with trans neon green, dark blue and metallic silver detailing. Very retro sci-fi. The section behind the firepit has a control panel - with elevated chair! - and stickered screen: The other section doesn't have anything apart from a red tank. More spare room for dead bodies, I guess. Or treasure. Or back issues of 'Supervillain Monthly'. I don't know, TLC, couldn't you have put some empty new Indy crates back there, or something? The interiors are a bit sparse, but maybe it's just because the place is brand spanking new and Dr Inferno has only just moved in. To be honest, I don't mind this really as it gives you a lot of chance to customise in whatever way you want. I am already planning to transfer the interior section of my Seabase MOCsomewhere to the Volcano Base, so Dr Inferno can chill out in style. Really, it looks as if the designers spent all the money on the exterior facade, but I have no real problem with that. The Mobile Command Center has a wonderfully detailed interior, but the whole set is based around the truck whereas this is really just a cool looking base with a stonking great laser on top and a firetrap. For $AUD99.99 ($30 less than the Mobile Command Center) I'd rather pay less and buy another copy of this set to do some serious volcano landscaping anyway. On that score, the Volcano Base can not be beat! Part 5: In Conclusion This is a great set. Buy it! Buy several! For a retail release not aimed at AFOLs, the level of landscaping could not be nicer. This means that the Volcano Base midsection may look a little low, but it does add opportunity for clever MOCers to build astounding, enormous creations which dwarf the original. The whole volcano wall design is really a template for people to build bigger and better volcanoes! As a playset, it is let down by the lack of detailed interior, but at this pricepoint I don't mind. The figs are good, Claw-Dette especially is great and the part selection is amazing. Leftover parts: Final view: Thank you and enjoy! Edited by svelte_corps, 08 July 2008 - 04:18 AM."

I am not a very big fan of Agents, but this theme defintely offer plenty of useful parts. This Volcano Base is simply fanastic for parts usage, especially in doing up landscaping, with mountains, by making use of the brown BURPS. I must admit that the exterior looks real cool, but the interior looks rather empty. These orange slopes certainly make a great illustration of the larva, which gives the Agents a hard time to infiltrate within its compound to save his comrade. I am quite sure, this set will defintely attracts lots of kids to coax their parents to buy it, since the bright colors will defintely caught their attention. With all those hi-tech, sleek weaponary, I am sure this is the next big thing for kids out there. Well, I am not sure if this theme works for me as well. But this set defintely works well for landscaping project."

Sure, the interior might be a bit bare, but I think that the outside of the base with all of the great lava and rocks more than makes up for it.

Do you plan of doing any other reviews? Or do you have any other sets? Rapid Rider is another great small one, adding a bit of diversity with a water-based vehicle, and you get the Bandit minifig. Or you could get The Rock Raiders set, and get all of our spelunking friends (don't make me name them all ). Or, if you want a slightly bigger set, Loader Dozer could be the way to go, Axle's a pretty cool minifig too, and you get a rock monster.

Lets start with a pic of the box, shall we? As you can see, its a Limited Edition set, meaning the fig and set could be worth a lot in the future. This set takes about 20 minuets for the seasoned builder. An overview of the Infiltrator (also know as the Scimitar): As seen in the picture, this ship is very sleek, with very few studs on top (SNOT= Studs Not On Top). Basically, Its the cockpit with two wings (with two ""fins"" on each wing), attached to the hull. Heres a side view of the Scimitar: Very cool- looking! It lands on two ""feet"" in the front while the cockpit rests on the ground. Rear view: The back. The outer cockpit is beautiful, a printed piece on the back (no dreaded sticker sheet! (DSS)) and a large printed disc on top: Heres a look at the middle: There is a flick-fire missile (trans-red cone attach to Technic pin) on the inner wing, a trans-red lightsaber blade in the back of the hull, and a trans-red lightsaber blade in between the fins on either side. All of those lightsaber blades may come in handy... Hey, look: the fins open from the wings!: The fins open due to double hinges on each fin. Unfortunately, you have to hold the ship up in order for the bottom fins to open. Now, lets have a look inside the cockpit: To open, you lift the back printed part, which is attached to the printed disc on top, which is attached to a hinge. It opens pretty smoothly, but is somewhat loose, so sometimes it closes on its own. Also, the disc isnt secured well enough to the door, and often breaks off, even with the smallest movement to it. Inside, there is an elevated control panel and two sliding pieces near the floor. This ship also comes with a small speeder bike: Its very cleverly built, and is a really neat addition. See that clear disc on the bottom? It fits perfectly into the sliding pieces in the cockpit: Hmm... whats this?: A hidden compartment! Now this was a very cool idea by TLG, a secret compartment found by taking off the top slope of the hull contains Darth Maul's weapons and tools which include: A (CHROME!) lightsaber hilt, a pair of electrobinouculars, and three probe droids. A closeup of a probe droid: Just a plain, black minifig head with a black lever on top. Finally, the fig: Darth Maul in the flesh plastic. A good fig altogether, with a black hood and lightsaber blades taken from the ship. He did come with a crisp, new black cape (packaged in a small, white cardboard box), but I am currently using it for another fig. Note that this is a limited edition fig, so stock up. A comparison pic of the two Mauls: The 2007 version is on the left, and the 1999 version on the right. Note a few key differences between the two: the new one has smaller red tattoos and a smoother torso. Also, the new one has bigger eyes and a more cartoony look. Maul on the speeder bike: Of course, he fits perfectly in the cockpit wile sitting on the bike, and he can reach the controls: Well, thats about it, here is the... FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, easy and fun, breaks every once in a while. Playability: 7/10, this set has many features, but is very fragile between the cockpit and hull and between the two cockpit pieces. Swooshability: 1/10, too fragile to fly around, plus the flick fire missiles fall out. Minifigs: 9/10, a great fig with a chrome hilt and a double sided blade. A little cartoony. Design: 7/10, very clever techniques, very sleek, but very fragile. Price: 8/10, fair enough, could be a few dollars cheaper. Overall Score: 6.5/10, a very sleek ship with clever building and play techniques, but very, very fragile, and shouldnt be picked up off of the shelf too often. And with that, my review is over, but all of yours are not: comments and thoughts very welcome!! Edited by JimButcher, 15 September 2008 - 02:59 AM. indexed"

So I purchased the remaining three Agents sets I needed, and saw that there was no review up yet for this set! Heres the first batch of parts, and the first instruction bits. The mini figures. The first small vehicles. Heres a mistake that I found in the instruction booklet. There is no difference between steps 2 and 3. The team Inferno boat. This is a nice chunky boat, that looks fairly heavy duty and evily. Its nice to see the smooth disks on the bottom, that LEGO seemingly havnt done in recent boat/plane sets. And the Agents Submarine! This is a nice build aswell. Nice and long, with a few hidden compartments. One for missiles. A place to put the treasure! Some final shots of the completed set! The spare bits! Another special mention has to go out to Slime Face. I think he is my favourite ever LEGO character. The detail on his unique torso is brilliant! His head is fantastic! And his costume just looks great, with the black and green (Plus green is my favourite colour!) Check out the back of his torso, with the slime pouring down! Deep Sea Quest was £34.99 Price ; 9/10 - This is a pretty reasonable price for a fairly substantial set. Parts ; 8/10 - A lot of nice bits, few nice boats bits, and a lot of smooth disk things. Minifigures ; 10/10 As I said Slime Face is my favourite LEGO character, and the details brilliant! Vehicles ; 8/10 Both very good, with some interesting features. Build ; 8/10 A pretty fun build. Overall ; 9/10 Its gotta be, if just for Slime Face alone, but this really is a great set!"

Your pics really show off the sub well and it's good to see the build in progress. I also have this set but I didn't apply stickers to the sub as I was planning to reuse the nice dark blue pieces. However as shown in your review they do brighten it up a fair bit. I can't say this is my favourite Agents set; the boat is a little oddly proportioned and the sub, although retro looking, has practically no interior and would be difficult to customise to put more in (unlike, say, the clever job Batbrick did with the Penguin sub in his review). The sub kind of looks like some Jules Verneish sea creature - I would have liked it if they'd gone all the way and made it some kind of giant robot jellyfish or squid I do agree with you about Slime Face - he has a fantastic torso with all the slime dripping down which is a bit obscured by the air tank. It's really encouraging that in the last 2 Missions we've had great extra villains added in. The only thing I would add about the octopus is that the glow in the dark plastic is mixed in unevenly with the aqua blue, so it doesn't glow in the dark evenly - it's kind of like the Mars Mission jellies in that respect though much cooler! Thanks again for the great review!"

Sort of keep the retro feel but make it bigger. With the 8636 sub, there's really only room for one Agent to sit and despite its size, there's just a few (not amazingly great) functions such as the hidden chest and missiles."

The set introduced/infused white and black bricks with classic blue space pieces. The result was this great classic vehicle. The set includes two figs (still red and white): Here's a view of the vehicle which is really two components, the vehicle itself and the lab section: I absolutely loved the the blue windshield slopes (2 included), and the unique upside-down large blue slope: In the back of the vehicle is the blue lab: The back section of the vehicle has hinges that allow the jets sections to open: The brick design fits perfectly into the lab, and when opened, the lab falls to the ground: NOTE: the little round trans. red 1x1s allow the lab to slide up and forward when the jet sections are closed. I tried taking off the red 1x1s and the lab does not lift as easily with them. The design is very clever, esp. for a classic set. Here's a shot of the stand-alone lab: Unlike earlier Classic Space windows, this set has train window frames with yellow windows. The top of the lab lifts up for playability: Inside the lab are several computers and a swivel chair: Back to the vehicle, here's a shot of the cockpit with white steering wheel: The left side has an upside-down wrench and black antenna: The right side, a walkie-talkie and another antenna. The antennas can be used as breaks to keep the middle wheels from moving: Here's ashot of the under carriage: And a final shot of the complete set: For those of you following my Classic Space reviews, this is review number 9 of 10.

I like how it combines two very different color schemes for different parts of the model. I have made some slight modifications to mine, adding a roof on the vehicle and a back wall on the outpost. Also, those white 1x1 headlight plates at the front are thinner than the modern kind and seem to be quite weak. I got this set off ebay a while ago and one of them was broken in shipping, even though the set was otherwise in display model condition, and the other one broke off while I was building the set. I replaced them with the newer variety. mutex, on Jul 10 2008, 11:37 PM, said: My only complain about this set was that I found that the wheels where too small , I had some trouble passing the rover over the little ""craters-mountains"" of the space plates The only bad thing about this set is the name.

I never had a chance to have any experience with the Classic Space sets. Through your recent reviews on these, it gave me a wider perspective of space. I loved to play space as a child such as the late classic and Futuron sets. Back to the review, this 6927 is a great mobile command center vehicle suitable for all kinds of harsh terrain in the unknown space. The 6 big wheels are real solid and firm back in those days. Transparent blue windscreen at the front, is wonderful. I just love these parts, especially when it's in blue. 4 computer printed tiles. Aren't LEGO so generous back in those days, when printed parts are more commonly available unlike now. It's a real nice set. However, there is one thing I don't understand about this design. Why is the driver seat has a wide back with no cover behind? And, the command center has no door at the back? I understand that these Space guys are always carrying their helmet around, for oxygen supply. I wonder if there is a better answer to it."

CP5670, on Jul 11 2008, 01:39 PM, said: I just modified mine to make everything fully enclosed: I love your modified 6927 with the enclosed front. 2 weeks ago I modified my All-Terrain Vehicle as well, in a similar way, but just *slightly* more modified from the original. I call it: 6927-C 'All-Terrain Vehicle Improved Class' a few clues for anyone to easily build this themselves: Also, a much more extensive modification/MOC that I call 6927-W ""All-Terrain Warrior"" Quote 6927-W 'All-Terrain Warrior' I wanted to make a combat variant of 6927, so I used the 6927-C Improved Class as the starting point and went from there. I added a completely new forward-cab, close to the ground, for a ground--observer to monitor the terrain. I added even larger wheels, allowing this variant to truly be ""all terrain"", ...besides, what good is it having a combat vehicle if it gets stuck in the middle of a firefight? The 6927-W has a five man crew: a driver, a gunner who also serves as overall-commander, a terrain observer in the very front. In the lab are the weapons systems officer and computer/tech specialist. The All-Terrain Warrior vehicle portion is armed with lasers and blaster cannons, with options for other weapons. There are short-range nuclear rockets on the lab, guided by the rader control. The lab now has blast-proof shutters on the windows protecting the crew from rocket blast. Additional protection can be added to the lab, if-need-be, such as more extensive blast-shielding. All-in-all, the All-Terrain Warrior is a beast of a machine. Two 6927s can protect an entire convoy of standard 6927 or 6927-C. These are my very first attempts at modification and doing a MOC of Classic Space LEGO! Edited by ParallaxScroll, 29 August 2009 - 03:03 AM."

Hooray!!! Sorry for the blurry back-shot. We see the hospital back, a few bubbles with set functions and a little comic. Comic: Bubbles: The figures are injured Spongebob, Patrick and the new Fish Doctor. Spongebob has a headprint... ...and a backprint (other than the normal Spongebob). Spongebob and injured Bob: The set comes with two litters. The ambulance car is a bit extraordinary. I don´t know how the car is like in the show (and I saw a lot of episodes) but it looks a bit strange, mostly because the weehls are too small. Of course we get another SS (not so D this time). The litter fits in the back, with help of this lid. I wish it would be the hinge-lid from before 2004... Now we come to the meanpart of the set: The hospital! The entrance has got babyblue traindoors and a hudge sign that shows ""Emergency"". The tubes are nearly everywhere in this set. I was getting insane when I came to the part, where I must put the stickers on the tubes. This parts are very usefull, but I wanted that the set looks good, because I will display it. So I stickered just two of the parts and not all four. Now we come to the interroir: The doctor has a desk with computer. Sadly it´s not very well placed and he must duck because of his fin. Next to the door, we get this little case, wash basin and two drawers. Again we get stickers... Not that I don´t like stickers. It´s just: Everytime I get to the part where I must put the stickers on, I think how I can re-use the model and if I rebuild the model, later and and and... I hate it to deside! A few posters are in it, too. The set is a great addittion to your own Bikino Bottom, but the playability is not very big for the kids. They can just play that Patrick steals the ambulance car, like shown on the package, and is hitting Spongebob. Than the drive back, the doctor gives Spongebob two medicines and let him go. I bought the set mostly because of the parts (tubes in lightbley and a few woodpieces). But I am thinking about let it stand in my little Bikini Bottom (just consist of Crusty Crab and Chum Bucket). Playability: 3/10 Figures: 10/10 Price: 8/10 Design: 9/10 TOTAL: 30/40"

It's the first BELVILLE set that I've bought for her so it's a bit of an experiment. The house is 5 rooms and it's made up of mostly large pieces. There still is a decent amount of normal LEGO in it though. The doorways in the house align when it is opened out. Starting with the bathroom, included is a shower, toilet, sink with vanity and a baby potty. The mirror sticker is one of the few that I put on. The open plan lounge/kitchen/dining room is well appointed as well and it has a nice glass table and coffee machine. The kitchen chairs are Fabuland parts... and don't work really well. It seems they are having jellyfish for dinner! The clock is the only printed part in the set. Upstairs is a baby room and the master bedroom. The radio and the TV (not shown) were stickers to my disappointment. Up top is an extra room suitable for reading. (Those antenna things were made from spare parts by my daughter. I have no idea what they are supposed to be... ) There are some stickers that go on the back, but I didn't put them on. As it is the set looks OK this way, but since it is a dolls house it doesn't really matter. I do think though that the fireplace should have been given a back. The BBQ is made from normal parts and is quite effective. I think it uses the same light brick that's in the 4998 Stegosaurus set. My kids were using it as a torch before my grumbling ruined their fun... Like all BELVILLE sets, the highlight is arguably the accessories. I'll be borrowing a few of these from time to time... Here is the controversial baby catapult. As you can see, it works OK, but LEGO probably should have tried a bit harder. We also bought for her 7583 Playful Puppy. It also comes with some nice accessories, but not enough to justify buying unless you want the rest of the parts. Poor puppy; where does he sleep? Here is my daughter assembling it. She made me make the house though as she wanted to play a game we bought her. (Note the LEGO drink bottles! ) I didn't take any photos of the figures as they don't seem to be anything new, but I can if people want me to. At the time I was in bit of a hurry as I took these before bed so I wouldn't be stressed if the kids broke it the next day. Overall, these sets seem overpriced to me, and hard to justify unless you actually want a buildable doll's house. (Which we did.) It's still too early to tell if my daughter likes it or not... but at this stage it seems she lost interest in a few days. She does tend to go back to toys though.

All through the review I was thinking 'This was a present - but who actually put it together?' so I'm glad the last pic cleared things up As for the set - it looks much bigger than I expected - I think it does make a good sized dollhouse. There are a stack of nice pieces in there - cupboards, oven, trans-blue 2x5 bricks, all the accessories, plants, flowers, food, the light-up brick, the pink roof slopes - but not enough to justify the $AUD129 retail price. Maybe on sale I'd pick it up and resell the Belville figs but David Jones hasn't even had a regular 20% off Lego sale for the whole of this year that I've seen. I think the Playful Puppy set is a horrendous ripoff for $AUD20 though. I agree with the baby catapult - the range is terrible. Lego just isn't trying any more, is it? At least they've moved on from throwing cats off three storey buildings. 2 questions though. 1) Was it a fun build? 2) Are those large figs anatomically correct under their frou-frou finery? If not, what the hell are they doing in the second pic whilst baby Sylvia explores the oven?"

It's nice to see how... it's nice to see how ... ... it's nice ... Okay, I can't get over the sex in the bedroom and the unattended baby crawling into the oven. I didn't read anything else except, where does the puppy sleep and my daughter made me build this. You are sick and twisted and that's why I love you! It seems you are coining the Belville edge. Now will you please stop sitting around eating clams and get that baby out of the oven or make the fun in the bedroom a three-way? Please! Thank you PS. OK, I read it. I want the baby toilet and I think the jellyfish is supposed to be a jello-mold. I bet you knew that. The fireplace lattice look like the Harry Potter one and not the Fabuland one. Boo!! Wienies. When your daughter outgrows it, will you turn it into a Belleville Star Wars MOC please? Thank you in advance"

I am very sure, she will enjoyed playing with it. Somehow, it reminded me of Barbie Doll products. Maybe, its too pinkish for me. The accessories is the ""plus factor"" in any BELVILLE sets. It offered quite a handful of great accessories to add into any types of MOCs construction to add in the plus factor in it. Sinner, you are a very nice Dad!

If your daughter is anything like mine, you will definitely get your money's worth out of it. However ... as soon as my daughter says she's done with it, I plan on raiding the sets for all those great food and accessory bits. Patience .... Great review, by the way. The Belville sets are indeed overpriced, but they're probably Lego's best attempt at wooing the girl audience (I still hate the fact that TLC thinks they need separate ""boy"" themes and ""girl"" themes, but whatever). They're a very nice alternative to Barbie -- you get posable figures with realistic body proportions, plus some creativity and building aspects thrown in."

The accessories truly are brilliant! There's so much here to be pillaged for other uses, as people have said. I picked up heaps of new parts I've never had, or rare ones in even rarer colours. To be honest, I was surprised and impressed by the range and versatility of the regular bricks as well. When you look at the box art, what jumps out at you are the giant pink walls and curved pieces, but there's a nice amount of white arches and lime green bricks, not to mention all the windows and the trans blue 1x2x5 bricks. And plants! It's a good thing the target audience likes stickers though, there's more here than I've seen on any set except the 7709 Sentai Fortress! I think they were aiming for one sticker per page of instructions I hope Belville returns in 2010 Thanks for the review, Sieggy! Did your daughter ever go back to it?"

While at any store that sells LEGO (Target, Wal-Mart, TRU, etc.), you will notice that the clone battle packs on the shelf are way fewer in number than the droids battle pack. As you might guess, the clones are way more popular, and finding them gets harder and harder as the release date of this set goes farther into the past. So stock up! Alright, heres a pic of the box: A small box, as expected for inexpensive sets like these. Note the ""Build your army"" button on the front: TLG obviously is encouraging customers to buy multiples, and with good reason, which will be explained later in this review. Well, lets get straight to it: The contents of this set. You will notice a speeder bike, a gun turret, and some clones. Looking good so far! Lets have a look at the turret: An excellent Star Wars element to have around, especially for MOCing. It is very cleverly built, using a tire guard from CITY sets for the general shape of the turret mount. All you have to do is attach the (new mold! explained later) gun to the 2x1 plate with the center stud, and... Presto! I wonder how the clones build these turrets to fast in the middle of battle... A rear view: With a clone mounted: My only gripe about the turret is that you have to take off the gun in order for every clone to have a gun. Now, we move on to the vehicle of the set, the speeder bike: A rather sleek and good looking bike, with some useful pieces on it as well, such as the blue cones, the megaphones, and the engines. Some say it looks bare without the figs mounted on it, but I think it looks just fine. The commander drives while a trooper shoots on the back. A side view: And a rear view: My only gripe is the same as the turret: you have to remove the back gun for all the clones to have weapons while on foot. The back pistol attaches to a 2x2 round studded plate with a Technic hole in the middle. Finnaly, here are the new guns: This set comes with 1 new blaster rifle and three new pistols. It could have included one more rifle for the turret. And of course, the figs: Includes: 1 yellow commander (lovely fig), 1 Shocktrooper (comes with a pair of elctrobinouculars), and two regular troopers (so clean and white). The figs are excellent, all that any SW or LEGO fan should want. It could have maybe included one more regular trooper, but that might be pushing it. Thats all for now, folks, here is the... FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, extremely easy, should take the seasoned builder about 5 minutes to complete. A fun build, though. Playability: 5/10, I guess you can get this with the droid battle pack and make them battle, but this set has no real play features of its own. But it is good for collecting troops and using them for MOCs. Swooshability: 9/10, I guess you can zoom the speeder bike around... Minifigs: 10/10, four great figs that should be bought in multiples, a great army builder. Design: 10/10, a clever turret, an awesome speeder, and four great clones. What more do you need in a 10 dollar set? Price: 8/10, not bad I suppose, but if you calculate a dime for each piece, this set should come out to 5-6 dollars. But still, billions of these are being sold world-wide, and TLG is making a ton of money off of them. Overall score: 9.5/10, a truly memorable set, one that will be a favorite for ages to come, and very popular. A great army builder for a small price, plus vehicle and turret! With only a few very minor flaws, this set is one of the best of Star Wars. And this concludes my review, and as always, comments are most welcome."

Year: 2007 Number of pieces: 102 Number of minifigs: 7 Price: 9.99 USD Brickset Hi everybody, and welcome to my fourth review on Eurobricks. Today, I will review the Droid Bttle Pack set. NOTE: This set originally came with four megaphone blasters for each battle droid, but I replaced them (along with the crooked arms) with the new blaster pistols and new twisted arms. A picture of the box: As it is on the shelves of major-retail stores. A small box, as expected for inexpensive sets like these. Note the ""Build your army"" button on the front: TLG obviously is encouraging customers to buy multiples, and with good reason, which will be explained later in this review. An overview of the set's content: You can see a droid carrying vehicle, a STAP, and some battle/ super battle droids. A look at the carrier: A light tank. Note the guns on the front: The guns and cockpit can turn a little bit left and right from the main body. Also, the guns can move up and down, free from the cockpit: And check out the cockpit: Two 2x1 center studded plates side by side for the pilot to stand on. Now, moving on to the STAP: A small, very useful vehicle in the SW universe. These are seen frequently in both the movies and games (as well as other multimedia). The design is very clever, using vertical building and a clear stand. Rear view: The guns/ handlebars can go this far back: And finally, the figs: The figs are very good, but very common. We havent seen SBDs in a while, and now instead of metallic blue, they are metallic dark grey. The worst part of this set is that the battle droids have the old arms and guns, while the droids in the MTT and clone pack (both of the same year as this) have the new ones. I wonder why TLG decided to do that... again, This set originally came with four megaphone blasters for each battle droid, but I replaced them (along with the crooked arms) with the new blaster pistols and new twisted arms. So thats about it, heres the... FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, very easy, should take the seasoned builder about 5-10 minutes. Playability: 6/10, has a few play feature, but nothing exciting. Is good for MOCs and army building. Swooshability: 8/10, I suppose you could fly around the STAP... Minifigs: 7/10, the battle droids are good, but very common, and the dont come with new arms or guns. The SBDs are very nice, and in a new color. All figs are great for army building. Design: 8/10, the STAP was clever, but the carrier was a little bulky. Price: 10/10, as fair as it gets. Overall: 7.5/10, the figs are great to have and make MOCs and armies, and the vehicles are pretty cool (the carrier is a little lame). The main problem with this set is that the BDs dont get the new guns or arms, so they dont fit in with all the new sets. Also, droids arent as cool as clones. But the price is very fair. And now, my review has ended. Unfortunately, I believe this will be my last review for a long time for two reasons: one, the remaining sets that arent done (according to KimT's index) I either don't have or are broken or have missing pieces. and two, my budget is low right now, and I wont be able to get the Clone Wars sets right when they are released, so someone will probably beat me to reviewing them. Too bad, because I would love to do an RGS review... well, as always, comments very welcome!"

"Michalkiewicz, Mateusz Dawid",1,http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?s=d249c2fe94a17dff454ffcb640cb5979&showtopic=19515&#entry327930,"Hello all Eurobricks members and Town Lovers, This is my first classic town review. For today, I will be featuring the 6641, 4-Wheelin' Truck which is produced in 1987. For some younger members in EB, you might not have encounter such a baby roaming down the streets, horning at others with its big massive truck. Considering this is a 1987 set, such a vehicle size is considered big in those days. Name: 4-Wheelin' Truck Theme: LEGO System / Town Year: 1987 Pieces: 80 Minifigs: 1 Price: USD$6.50 An image of a 6641, 4-Wheelin' Truck *Hello Everyone* Why the name 4-Wheelin' Truck? It is because this truck is equipped with 4 heavy duty wheels which is considered ""big"" among other small vehicles in Classic Town. Please take note, most of the vehicles that are produced in Classic Town era, are 4-studs wide. This truck is no exception. Meet the driver and his truck! This truck has a very good combinations of different colors that are common for most town vehicles. It made used of blue, white and red as its primary combinations. I find that this combinations is quite soothing to its eyes especially the blue bricks. In addition, the mini-fig torso is superb. The driver must be a great fan of this vehicle. I realised most truck drivers in the classic town era wear this most of the time. I wonder if its some kind of an organization? Front view There is 2 red doors coupled with the truck, to enable the driver to get in properly. This vehicle is considered big in the 1980s. However, if you compared it with the current city vehicles, this truck certainly will not outsize the current designs. Please take note of the wheels. The wheels are pretty different. I don't remember seeing these wheels in many other vehicles, maybe some members can help me on this. Most of the classic town vehicles have a window frame on top which is known as a ""sun-roof"". In this set, this feature is also included. Furthermore, the vehicle frame has a simple mechanism which all town lovers love. It is to lift it up and place their driver in and out the seat. Most importantly, you do not have to take off the entire window frame just to put in the driver. Different angles of the 4-Wheelin' Truck SNOT Technique? Back 20 years ago, LEGO had been experimenting with SNOT technique. You can see that the back looks very neat without the studs. In addition, it can be quite useful to place a mini-fig on top of it, or throw some baggage for some quick getaway. Summary review Playability: 8/10 (Great addition to your Town collection.) Design: 8.5/10 (Very good design. I love 4-studs truck. At least, it is able to occupy one side of the lane) Price: 9/10 (An inexpensive set based on the 1987 pricing) Overall: 8.5/10 (A must have for all Classic Town lovers, we have been complaining for more wider range of vehicle) I gave it a ""4"" based on my Review Score Card. What about yours? Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. Pictures can be found in My Brickshelf (When moderated) Edited by WhiteFang, 13 July 2008 - 12:08 PM."

As for the wheels, these were primarily Technic wheels but did find their way into some other models. In white, I can only find a handful of minifig sets that they are included with. There's half a dozen space sets but, apart from the 4-Wheelin Truck, the only other Town set appears to be the 6524 Blizzard Blazer (tractor with snow plough). The wheels were also in a Train set called 4549 Road & Rail Hauler where they were the wheels on a big forklift. Cheers Rog"

I had the set in my hands a few times but never bought it, though I drooled at it, I remember. I guess I didn't get pocket money at that time, it was not that common around europe in the 80s I guess. So better to say that no one bought it for me.. A few years later I got the safari truck, which is also really sweet. I like the colors of this model and the detail of it. The minifig is really classic, made only for this set (appears in some later train sets as well) and shows the exact image of the truck on the shirt, including the motor piece. One of the most detailed and loveliest little sets from a sweet era of Legoland city! PS Voted ""O"" for Outstanding. Edited by Zzz, 14 July 2008 - 09:50 AM."

I never really liked those wheels, honestly. They're from the basic sets, mostly, and they work pretty well in those, but i'm just not a fan... the roof, on the other hand, was very popular and the blue modified bricks at the front were quite rare in those days, but generally speaking, this was not the star of 1987. gave it a ""3"""

I wouldn't agreed less. This set is a good to have and is defintely not the main highlights in 1987. This is actually a great add-on to your classic town vehicle collections. After seeing so many typical police cars, ambulance, fire engine and etc, I need more variety of civillan vehicles roaming down the streets."

The shuttle as stand-alone: i think that would be fuel tanks, i like this little detail: And finally we have the controll room, would have been better with seats, but it's alright: A really sweet mid-sized set if you ask me, a few juniorized parts, but it fits perfectly with the set. The theme itself is also great, and i wish that TLG brings it back, i could see stunning sets with the quality city sets have right now!"

It was released during my dark age, and I had missed it. It's nice to see such sets, surface once again, to educate members like me that there are some good sets we had missed during the dark age. And, I must admit that this is a very good set. It's comes with 3 mini-figs and Staudie with it. Geez, I never thought he was an astronaunt back then. The testing facility is great, and I love to see it spin, by putting Staudie in it for a ""test-run"". The buggy is cute as well, but somehow, I don't really like the white frame at the back. It looked a little odd to me. The tools, are simply wonderful to have. Furthermore, these are grey tools. The last time, we had so many tools are the aeroplane mechanic. The shuttle is nice, but does the shuttle supposed to come with a cover as well? I guess, since this is a simulator, they must have cut down the budget for it. The control room is good, and it will be even better with chairs included. metalandi, thanks for the wonderful review!"

Also note the ships appearances in 'LEGO Space- The Comic', piloted by Lance and Vance Gemini (Kudos to KDog for the wonderful comic!) Here we have the overall View of the Futuron Heavy-hitter. Love the details on the guns, with the pipes and all, also the dishes at the front look very menacing. Here we have the Crew, (In KDog's Space Comic, Lance and Vance Gemini), this ship also features a nifty rover, fitting in the back of the vessel. The two side pods deattach and can create another ship, although I do not know the purpose of it... Sleeping chambers for the crew mayhaps, or most likely storage. Here they are linked together, this could be used as a base or outpost of some sort. The pod opens on both sides, via the window and the back. These pods also feature Trans-Red Rocket endings! beautiful pieces. Trans-red Rocket endings!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The ship without the pods, looking quite sleek, this is the only set in the futuron theme to boast numbers on a trans-blue window. (Correct me if I'm wrong...) The tiny, yet functional Rover. Finally, the crew inside, except one guy has to eat helmet most of the trip... I love this set! I give it a five out of five, This is one of the best Futuron sets, with some awesome module-bility?

This is one of the construction vehicles that are available for constructing our towns in 1980s. Before I start, my Bulldozer is not 100% complete. Try and spot the missing piece and tell me at the end of the review? Name: Bulldozer Theme: LEGO System / Town Year: 1986 Pieces: 65 Minifigs: 1 Price: Unknown An image of a 6658, Bulldozer Let the review begins Firstly, I am quite confused why it is called Bulldozer. I am sure you are quite familar with the bulldozer below instead. It should be called as a digger. Well, I will classify the 6658 as a medium digger. Throughout the years, LEGO had placed yellow as construction theme. It seemed that yellow bricks are widely used for construction vehicles. I am not saying that only construction vehicless are allowed to use yellow bricks. It seemed to be a representation of construction. In the recent years, City had created a construction theme and had two diggers under that category. They are known as mini-digger and digger. Even till this day, they are still using yellow bricks for construction vehicles. Meet the driver and the bulldozer It seemed that this driver is wearing a typical blue torso, with its classic red safety helmet. There are no prints to indicate he is someone whom is working in construction field. Unlike, the current construction theme, every worker is required to wear a safety vest during work. Well, I feel that the driver's torso is quite good for changing it into other townfolks. Just change the hairpiece and you will get a typical citizen in the city. Playing mechanisim The bulldozer is able to move its digger bucket upwards and downwards. In addition, the yellow digger bucket is able to move too. This promotes great playability to scope out some debris from the construction site. It can swirl? Yes, the bulldozer is able to swirl left and right by making use of the black catch. It can shift itself while reversing. Personally, I find this feature very wonderful and excellent. At least, I know my bulldozer won't be restricted to one angle. Place the driver here By opening the top frame, the hinges will be able to move upwards and downwards without tearing down the whole seat. This feature will only be seen in most Classic Town vehicles. You can't find this anymore in the current city collections. Different angles of the bulldozer Summary review Playability: 8/10 (Very fun to play with) Design: 8.5/10 (Very realistic design. Just the naming, I still don't understand why its called bulldozer) Price: 8/10 (An inexpensive set based on the 1986 pricing, quite worth for what you are getting for) Overall: 8.2/10 (A must have for all Classic Town lovers, even for the current Construction theme. This will fit in very well) I gave it a ""5"" based on my Review Score Card. What about yours? So, have you found the missing piece? Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. Comments and critics are strongly welcomed. Pictures can be found in My Brickshelf(When moderated)"

Set: 7673 Magna Guard Starfighter Contains: 2 Magna Droids Obtained: 16 July 2008 Location: Ireland Price: Euro59.99 First up the box is as expected and is in the new 2008 white and blue colours. The rear promotes the three other clone wars sets due out shortly. The box is opened using the thumb through box method rather than cutting through clear seals. Once opened the box contains 6 bags, 1 sticker sheet, 1 set of instructions and 2 wedge panels. The first items to be assembled are the two Magna Droids and these look really good. I can confirm that the head piece is what appears to be of normal lego material and is not made of rubber or soft plastic. I haven't seen the cape design before but it seems to be normal cloth. Here is a pic of the Magna Droid. Construction, as expected starts with the cockpit and there is a very neat mechanism to open the canopy. One thing I've noticed recently and it applies equally to this set is that the pieces click together very well with a very satisfying click when attached, something that has been missing occasionally in recent years. The cockpit section is straightforward to construct and is attached to the engines by very secure struts made primarily of plates. The rear of the cockpit contains an opening mechanism for the flick missiles. At least these are of the friction type which means that they shouldn't fall out while swooshing. Once the middle section and support for the engines are built its time for the engines and associated weaponry. Before then there are some stickers to be applied. In general the stickers are in easy locations and are not too tight a squeeze unlike those in some sets I could mention. The engine sections are very well designed and are robustly attached to the main cockpit. There is a fair amount of snot techniques used with the side panels attaching quite securely to the engine frames. The Magna Droid weapons are stored in the rear of these engines which is a nice thought. The remaining stickers are somewhat subtle and wouldn't detract too much from the model if left off. For the last few stickers its easier to apply them to the bricks before attaching the bricks to the model. I did notice that some of the slopes have smooth surfaces and others have rough surfaces but at least bricks of the same type have the same consistency. Some stickers aren't visible in normal display mode because they are covered by the top engine cover. I really liked the greebling on the side sections and the 'piping' on the front. There is a nice laser (or rocket depending on which way you look at it on the extremeties of the ship. I found the set a satisfying build with little repetition. It shouldn't take too long to build in normal circumstances but I stopped every so often to take notes and pictures. The minifigures are unique to this set and look very well. Its a pity that its a bit awkward to get the droid into the ship while wearing a cape - real health and safety issues there - the Incredibles comes to mind The final ship looks well and has smooth lines, a much better looking ship than Rogue Shadow. It feels very secure when swooshing and doesn't have too many parts likely to break off easily. I could imagine myself getting another one or two of these if the price was right. Euro 59.99 is a bit steep but probably not the worst value out there this side of the Atlantic where many sets seem to be at the Euro74.99 price point. Unfortunately this will be the cheapest of the four most imminent clone wars sets. img_2431es.jpg 75.2K 80 downloads Enjoy David Edited by KimT, 04 August 2008 - 11:48 AM. indexed"

The ship itself looks good, and after seeing your pic of the fig(s), it looked a lot better. When the toyfair pics came out, I thought the cape was plastic and the head rubber. But thanks for clearing all that up. Using SBD legs was a good choice by TLG, in my opinion, it looks better than BD legs in this case. Still, this set is at the bottom of my list before the Twilight, because its a bit expensive, not that great, and I have much better sets to obtain first. So maybe if I have some leftover money. Also, what are the pipes on the fins like? Rubbery or plastic?

The Magna Droids are reasonably balanced and do not need their staffs to stay upright, and The reason why I thought this would be the cheapest set of the first wave four here in Ireland is because Smyths Stores in Ireland had prices up for the clone sets earlier in the week on their website (which I can't find now) as follows: Gunship 7676 Euro 119.99 ATTE 7675 Euro 99.99 V19 7674 Euro 74.99 Magna Guard 7673 Euro 59.99 While these prices might change they don't look so outlandish.

They look like someone took a hasbro-esque action figure cut its off at the shoulders and stuck it on an exoforce robot. A simple new molded head (like Grevious) and a cape would have worked just as well and looked more Lego like. Guess I won't be getting any of manga droids... Steve

Nice new head, although the glasses limit its usability. I am in LOVE with the head on that fig. It's perfect for any number of figures - a good 'scarred hero' face has always been on my want list. I'm turning him into my Viking warlord after I post this review. Again, a new head. Great stubbly beard thing going on. My second-favorite head of the lot. Great for warriors, especially with helms. The torsos are fantastic for special forces figures, if anyone's planning to do something like that. Not TOO fond of the lime green on there, but it's still extremely usable. This is actually a really cool machine gun. I like it. I think this would be a good point to note that ALL designs you see - outside the figures and dinos - are stickers. That means a crapload of stickers. If you can't stand stickers at all in a set, don't buy this."

The photos really don't do the size justice. Lower cockpit with cool computer. Too bad it's a sticker, although I'll definitely leave this one on. Upper cockpit with cool computer. See above. Awesome gatling gun. Yes, even the TECHNIC BEAMS have stickers. I'm actually really fond of that little canister thing. I can see using it elsewhere. Yes - that's a sticker. The rope and hook. I forgot to mention it before, this set comes with two accessories besides the machine gun - binocs and one of those little things to slide down the rope. Also, the thing that 'extends' the rope turns. The other side, because they're slightly asymmetrical. One of my favorite stickers. The door says 'SURVIVAL EQUIPMENT'. It's on both sides. Definitely a keeper."

Let's cut straight to the chase. Dinos: First the worst, of course. These things are so horrible, they don't deserve more than one photo. They're rubbery, one piece, and the only things that remotely indicate that they're made by LEGO are the holes on the bottom of their feet. They're unrealistic to an extreme unmatched by even the previously reviewed Dinos, in that they are waaaaaaaay too thin, one is pink, and they're all grinning. Fig: One interesting thing to note is that this one has the same torso as the iron-masked dude in the chopper, not his own bare-arms torso. Pic for the sake of comparison. Now, I don't consider this fig as good as the others because the other heads are useful for Vikings and assorted castle-type people, but this has sunglasses. All in all, you'll probably find it useful, but I don't. Still, great torso for special ops stuff. Hummer: Those headlights - while stickers (yes, all prints are again stickers, although there are much less than the chopper) - are great pieces. I can see using them as furnace covers or stove burners. The windshield/hood area. Not much to say about this one. Driver's side. My question? When this is brought to Europe, will the steering wheel switch sides? ;) Seriously though, I love that little steering wheel piece more than I love taffy. And I'm a man who enjoys his taffy. Left side in its entirety. ... and the right side. View through the right side - no seat here. Could've done with another fig to fill the nonexistant seat, as well."

This uses the same mechanism as the longboat (for those that don't have either, you snap the little sports stand thing, which hits the 'missile', which fires, and since there's nothing holding the technic beam up to that height any more, it drops down so that the next missile drops into place. Pretty cool, if unrealistic.). The two on the side do NOT fire, I think they're mainly there for 'extra ammo'. My biggest problem with this set. Open bed. This could have easily been remedied with a few plates. Interior opened. The Fire Hammer next to the T1. They look very cool together, don't they? You can also see my curio shelf. FINAL SCORE: 7.4/10 Dinos: 1/10 Fig: 8/10 (but that's just me) Hummer: 8.5/10 Parts: 9/10 I'm a harsh reviewer. I still think that if space/vehicles are your thing, you should buy this. However, if you're a bigger castle fan, or just like to get all sorts of LEGO, I would still suggest buying the Viking Catapult before this. However, I do think that these are some of the coolest sets of 2005. This is something you will eventually want to get. Until next time, Bloody Jay"

Got it 2 days ago, thanks to a fast shipping from S@H this time, and i found time now to review it now. Enough of the babbling, let's let the facts and pictures speak, which actually turned out pretty well this time. Set Nr.: 4210 Name: Coast Guard Platform Number of minifigs: 4 Number of pieces: 469 Release Year: 2008 A few shots of the box first: 2 Books of Instructions we got here, first one for the helicopter second one for the rest and the platform itself: A general overview of the platform from above: The 4 minifigs, 3 rescue guys and one oil rig worker (?). The pilot seems not very happy that he has to work in the middle of nowhere at sea Right beside the entry of the tower we have the diving equipment holder: Next, the guy can jump in this little speedboat... ...and another guy brings it down to water with the crane: If somebody is rescued from the air, he arrives here and is brought to the tower with the little moving platform than runs on ""rails"": Down under we got a buoy and several life belts and extinguishers: With the lift somebody who is rescued by the boat can be brought up. I think it would been better if they would have made a mechanism there to bring it up, but it's okay: A few floors higher the sea is being observated and watched: On the ground level we have the medical station/warm-up room: The helicopter as stand-alone: All in all for me this is besides the police station THE city set of this year. It's got great features, and looks fantastic and also has many useful pieces. You can't do anything wrong with buying it, 10/10 for me! That's all for now, hope you liked my review. Edit: Oh damn, i forgot to write ""review"" in the topic title, can a mod please add this? Thanks!"

This is just the ""Crown Jewel"" for the Coast Guard theme. I love the layout of its platform. It looks real neat to have it placed it in the midst of the deep blue sea, awaiting of any emergency rescue. Sometimes, I feel that this set can used it to merge with my Aqua Raiders sets. I thought of using it as a land base, for the raiders to dock in their stuff before submerge into the ocean. Ok, it's just a wierd idea of mine. Just feel that Aqua Raiders and Coast Guard can work hand in hand, since they are naval expertise! It seemed, I can't view all the pictures somehow. Nevertheless, I can still view some of it quite well. I love the command center. The amount of computer printed pieces simply make me smile, with the monitor, keyboard, radar screen and etc. The helicopter is cute too. However, I pity the victim that is loaded at the back. It seemed a little bit too dangerous. In addition, this set seemed to have quite alot of stickers, which can be quite discouraging. I do hope to see this set soon. So far, I quite like the Current Coast Guard sets."

The function of a paramedic is to take a patient from an emergent situation, and deliver them to a hospital for treatment, generally an Emergency Room. This is a rather small ""clinic"" that I would imagine is more for family care than an Emergency Room. In addition, the car looks more like a doctor/nurse's car rather than an Ambulance or Emergency Response Vehicle. I would call this a ""Clinic"" rather than a Paramedic Unit. In any case, it's a great set, esp. for Table Towns that need medical services. What I like is that this set is small enough to place anywhere in your Lego City or Town. Starting with the instructions: Like all the classic town sets, alternate models are pictured, although i never tried building one: I like the little medical bus/van. The set includes two minifigs, that include a female Doctore or Nurse, and what I presume is a patient, based on the torsos: I really like the vehicle. It's a 4-stud wide two seater: The colors work well and I like the use of the white bar between the seats (and the 1x1 blue plates for lights). Unfortunately, the emblems are stickers. Here's a shot of the neat little ""Clinic"": I like the use of the blinds for the exam room. It shows that Lego considered patient privacy when making this set. The interior includes an exam room, desk, and two blue swivel chairs: And a neat little eye chart: Although the letters L E G O would have made a nice touch. Lastly, a picture of the complete set: I must admit that I remember buying this set back in the 80s and I regreted it after taking it home. I'm not sure what I didn't like about it (perhaps the ""girl"" back then), but now I really think it's a neat set. Well, there's a line of patients waiting to have their eyes checked... Comments welcome."

Ambulance, with a group of paramedics will be ideal for this kind of situation. I love female doctors, especially with that lovely hairpiece! The cruiser, is a neat 4-studs wide design. Just love these small car designs back then. I wonder what can be used at the back of its boot. The clinic is neat. Maybe, we can send Holodoc for some medical audit, to make sure that this clinic is up to standard. What surprised me the most, is the neat little eye chart. You don't see such details in any regular LEGO set. The red and white color combination for the building, works well for me. Most of the hospital buildings and vehicles, always revolved in red and white. I gave this a ""4"" Thanks you so much, Brickster!"

Paramedic's are advanced Ambulance technicians. Unlike standard EMT's they are trained for Advanced Cardiac Life Support. They can push drugs, defibrillate, place a breathing tube etc. in the 1980's when the set was made, it was quite common for Paramedics to respond to calls in ""fly cars"" or special response units. They would join up with Ambulances at the scenes that required their skills. If you ever watched the old American TV show ""Emergency"", Johnny Gage And Squad 51 were one of these response units. They were mostly phased out in the 90's in favor of simply putting the Paramedics and ALS gear in the ambulances."

This name is quite wierd to me. I will prefer to call it the regular tow truck. This is one of the service and repair vehicle that are always ready 24/7 on stand-by for any emergency towing in our towns. Name: Hook & Haul Wrecker Theme: LEGO System / Town Year: 1989 Pieces: 44 Minifigs: 1 Price: USD$6.00 An image of a 6660, Hook & Haul Wrecker Let the towing begins Hook & Haul Wrecker is the typical 4-studs wide vehicle that takes care of broken vehicles that is left stranded on the roads. This tow truck is pretty useful. As you can see, current City sets hardly have any tow trucks available to tow new cars design. This tow truck is catered for 4-studs vehicles for Classic Town. Can you imagine yourself this truck towing a Speed Racer car? I think it looks really out of proportion. In addition, the mini-fig which is included in this set has the regular truck print on its torso. I am very sure they must be a fan club for ""Trucks"". Otherwise, they should really need a change of clothes. Nevertheless, in my honest opnion. I really love this torso very much. Somehow, it makes them look tough even though their face looks very friendly. Side View This vehicle has a combination of two primary colors which is white and red. This color combination looks very good. You cannot mistook it for an ambulance since they made use of this two colors too, in most Emergency vehicles. This is my guess, I supposed the designer will have tow truck concept as a form of emergency and considered red and white as its combinations. This vehicle set-up has the typical sun-screen on the top of the vehicle frame. However, this baby has more unique features installed in it. These are the source of its brutal strength All-Terrain Vehicle??? This tow truck equipped with the best wheels. In fact, these wheels offer suspension on the roads. Even when its travelling uphill, the truck will move accordingly with its tyres. When you act pressure on the top of the vehicle, it will either be shifted leftwards or rightwards. Close-up of these unique tyres Take a careful look. These wheels have springs installed in it. That is the magic of these vehicle and is defintely suited to run on any rough roads with least problems. If any EB Members know which other vehicles has this unique features, please highlight it to me. Because, if I remembered correctly. I only remember seeing this pair of tyres in this great set. He is ready for some serious towing. The driver had finished hook up the pizza van on its back. It's pretty simple. You just have to lift the back of the vehicle and placed it onto the hook. Presto, the van is ready to go. This vehicle provides so much fun. You can really tow any 4-studs vehicle in your town. And, here we go! To the service station. Poor pizza guy. Summary review Playability: 10/10 (Superb fun. You will love to use this truck and tow any vehicles) Design: 9.5/10 (Excellent design. Especially with the use of the suspension tyres) Price: 9/10 (An inexpensive set based on the 1989 pricing. This set is made up of less than 100 pieces) Overall: 9.5/10 (Every Town must need a tow truck. If a vehicle breaks down, whom will be ready to tow?) I gave it a ""5"" based on my Review Score Card. What about yours? Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. Comments and Critics are strongly welcomed. Pictures can be found in My Brickshelf(When moderated)"

This is a wonderful 80's vehicle - and I think it might be one of the first - if not THE first - that had the spring suspension system. I know of at least one other set that had that: the biggest Extreme Team set from 1998 had a vehicle with those pieces. Quote This tow truck is pretty useful. As you can see, current City sets hardly have any tow trucks available to tow new cars design. This tow truck is catered for 4-studs vehicles for Classic Town. Can you imagine yourself this truck towing a Speed Racer car? I think it looks really out of proportion. Firstly, Speed Racer cars are out of scale even with City vehicles. Also, I have hope that in the next few years we will get more Octan sets to go with the wonderful gas station - and I suspect that a 6-wide tow truck will be at the top of the list. It wouldn't be a hard set to make, and I bet it would sell well. Edited by Grevious, 19 July 2008 - 05:31 PM."

They also have an identical width with the wide 2x2 wheels holder which is used on cars today. They are still excellent today, since retrofitting these suspension parts onto today's off-roader trucks won't give them weird proportions or any problems, and it looks perfect. Plus they are useful if you're lazy and don't feel like constructing the pin-suspension used in the early 90's for truck-trailers, altough stability probably will suffer."

Never understood why a tow truck needed to be an off-roader; maybe it was used to tow the other off-road vehicles. The suspension made the truck too tall to tow some cars, so I often took the hook out and use the truck as just an great off-road truck like 6672 (which also had the suspension wheels). Other tow truck sets better filled their roles better, but that doesn't diminish this set at all. WhiteFang, on Jul 18 2008, 09:19 AM, said: I think it looks really out of proportion. No, for 25-odd years this vehicle was perfectly proportioned with all others in the town/city line. It's all these new 6 and 8 and 20 wide vehicles that are ignoring convention and making it look out of proportion. Granted speed racer sets are more of their own line, but 6660 is smaller than most of the cars produced in the last few years."

Starting with the instructions: The backside with a great picture of the complete set: The set includes three minifigs including two gas station attendants and my favorite, the Urban Cowboy: One of the best things about this set is that it includes not one, but two very detailed 4-stud wide vehicles. Here's a picture of the red one which is a two-seater: The car has two working doors, a hood that opens, and a little holed brick on the other side for pretending to ""fill 'er up"". Here's another image at an angle: Isn't she a nice set of wheels! Here's the yellow car. I always liked this one better, perhaps it was the color with the black pieces in the back, although it is a one-seater: The set includes four fuel pumps that are numbered (with decals) and included a string as the hose: Here's a little accessory rack for oil and tools: And another rack for tires: The set had a nice Exxon logo on three 1x6 bricks: A large jack allows the cars to be lifted high into the air for tire and under engine repairs: I love the office with its large 5x6 window. Inside is a chair and desk. And the entire set: Happy Motoring in Legoland!"

Man, this is sure a wondeful kit, even today. The level of detail is astounding for the time, and the whole kit is really cute. You know, I honestly don't get why some people have complained about the CITY gas station's figure count - the majority of lego gas stations had no more than three figures - including this one and the wonderful Gas and Wash Express (which I actually own!). I also don't get why people complain about the stickers so much - because even older kits often had a lot. Personally, I think stickers are okay, because printed pieces can't be used in as many places if the stickers are really specialized."

I don't understand why I always loved these Classic Gas station such as Shell, Exxon and Octan. They just look so lovely. No City or Town could ever survive without these important key installations around, to pump gas/petroleum for all vehicles, that depend it for fuel consumption. As always, all Gas Station will always inculde a road plate, and I am glad I am still seeing roads included in such sets, such as the recent 7993, Service Station. However, Town Plan's Gas Station, did not include a baseplate though. Nevertheless, let me continue with this review. 3 Lovely mini-figs, included in this set. It's not common to see Exxon torsos these days. I just love that lady staff very much, especially with its classic hairdo. 4-studs car just simply rocks, with such fabulous simple design. Furthermore, it gave you 2 cars instead of one. What more can you ask? You don't see TLG giving more cars in recent sets these days. What surprise me about this cars, is the ability of opening the front engine column. I remembered vividly that only trucks or massive vehicles, does have this playing feature. Nevertheless, it's an excellent addition. For a 1980 Gas Station set, this is a perfect set, even when it's going to fit into my current Town buildings. I am sure, it won't have a hard time to match with the rest of the facade. I can use this gas station and stationed it near the country side. This set is so hard to resist, with such elegant design of its fuel pump. There are a total of 4 pumping stations. The vehicles won't be fighting against each other, for slots then. The reparing area is very nice, it will be even better if it include a shelter on top of it. The office is simple and nice. I had never expect an office to exist in Gas Station. Most of the time, there are groceries stores, for the consumers to get off, buy off some stores and load it in the car. No major complains from me. I am not trying to be selection bias. I had demostrated key points which is good enough to justify my score. And, I gave it a ""5"". Outstanding Classic Gas Station set."

Set Name: 7649 MT-201 Ultra Drill Walker Price: $69.99 Pieces: 759 Bought from: Tor R Us in Michigan, US. The Box: First we have the front. It shows the Set, it's functuns, and the Limited edition sign. The box is huge, about the size of the Dino Attack chopper set or the Mars Mission Base. Nowadays, most set that are $50.00 or more have a flap displaying the sets functions. Opening theflap on this box Reveals a GIGANTIC picture of the set. And the back. The bags, numbered: Next, the manuals. They have piece call outs, page numbers, etc. There are 2 manuals with this set. Sticker Sheets: They actually aren't all that bad. Random Manual image: Build: First, we open bag 1. This will build the Alien Craft and the minifigures. Now here we have some interesting parts. A green spine from Exo-force, and a black rim for the set Container Stacker. Next we start the build on the alien craft. It is pretty sturbdy, but has no cockpit for the alien. The alien stickers are really cool. They are rainbow-ish, and has a silver back. Next come the build on the wings: And the finished craft. It is pretty good, and has a nice sleek design. However, I think I will use the large ship for the commander out this year to fight the driller instead. Next is bag 2, which builds the rover and Astro Ship. First is the Ship. It starts off with Doctor Inferno's colors. It builds up very nice, and the detail is absolutley amazing. Next the roof is built. It has some speed racer slopes. The hinge piee now has a hole through it. Sorry for the blurry pic: More is added: Then comes the bottom piece. The detail is very nice, and the hinge piece has a use later on. Then you build the crates. Each one holds two crystals. Added to the ship, also a pic of the finished ship. Here we start the rover. It sports anice detail- The orange studs get coveded by the grill to look more like an engine. The detail in this thing is pretty good. It has a gun and shovel. Here is how it fits into the ship: It slides in... And is secured thanks to the hinge. Okay, so next we open the number 3 bag, which builds the body. Here are some interesting pieces: Then we start the build. It begins nice and study: I just love these stickers with the bulldogs on them: More of the build, with the stickers added: Next we add in the front part. The detail is again, outstanding. With the turntable added. It can move down as well. The next step is to build the water tank. It utilizes the bionicle boosters(big white things) And added to the walker: Then we build that drill. It uses a lot of rims and such. With the gears added: The front part uses a lot of those new droideka 3-prong things. And bionicle eyes. The drill can spin thanks to the gears. And added to the vehical: Next is the cockpit. It has a nice space for the Astro's bckpack. Added: The final stage is the legs. Thank god they aren't like Striking venoms. They are all the same, however. See those two rubber parts? Those keep it in place when on surfaces like glass. Next come the large part of the legs. These are similar to the Assault Tiger's legs. The final result is very sturdy, thanks too... Notice the amazing classic space sticker? So we finally come down to this: The final result is amazing. It is sturdy, and has great detail. It is very realistic. And, when the ship is removed, the drill goes down, and the turret is aimed up... Hope you all enjoyed the review!"

I think placeholders should be banned and if you are not ready to post a full review you should not post anything. Simple really.

I got this one last week at a pretty fair prive at ebay, new and still sealed. I love opening boxes that had been lying arounf for years and being the first to build an old set. Since i know this castle theme is not liked so much by the general public, i'll try here and change their minds, cause i really think this is a great set. This time i have to say my pictures turned out pretty amazing, even if i am still using just my cellphone cam, but i'm really pleased now with the quality. Here we go! Set Nr.: 6097 Name: Night Lord's Castle Number of minifigs: 7 Number of pieces: 598 Release Year: 1997 Let's start with a few box & instructions pictures: The inside od the box, with a few alternate models: The back, with another possibility how to assemble the 3 main parts: Instructions: Next, the 6 minifigs, starting with the witch on her black dragon: All 5 figures of the fright section: And the poor royal knight: We go on with the set itself, first a general overview (it's really high!): On the ""first floor"" there's a trap with which you can drop stones or other things down on unliked guests, the pot comes originally from fabuland i think, i love this thing: In the same floor there is a second trap, if you pull the bar, the door opens: We move on to the tower itself (did i mention it's really high?), on the ground level there's the place for the witch to do her spells: The wall is a secret door, which reveals a skeleton when turned over: on the next level there is this little thingy, first it only seems like a barrel.... ...but when you pull the two 1x4 tiles on the back, a skull is being revealed, scary, huh : I don't really understand what this is for but i assume it's a telescope to watch and observate the dragons, i do find that a bit senseless since there haven't been telescopes in medieval times (or have there been): The back of the tower with the prison and the room for the treasure chest: The prison opened. It's secured with a chain, which i like very much cause you really can lock it with that: Treasure chest: From the highest peak we now go down to the very ground level, at the back of the castle there is another secret wall-door, flanked by two shields: At the back half of the inside there is the throne hall for the Bat Lord, with a nice warm fireplace in the back (this is, where the secret door is placed): The second half is pretty empty, except for these two baskets. i don't know exactly what they are for, but i ike the idea for using them as water places for the horses: One thing that might be a bit stupid is that 2 of the 4 side entrances do not have doors, so they are open and a guard would have to stand there the whole day. You can see it in his face he isn't very happy with that : That was my last review of the sets i got the last weeks, but i'm looking forward to make much more in the future. Overall this is a pretty good set, i don't know any other one with so much details and playability. The minus point is, as already said, that it is too open on the sides, but that can be solved easily with a bit of modding. Also i must say, this set isn't that much juniorized as many might have thought, though the design is a bit unconventional, but exactly that's what i like most about it. All in all it gets a 9/10 for me hope you enjoyed the reading and the pictures, can't wait to see your response. Edit: Oops, i forgot to put one figure of the fright knight faction on the photo, but it's the one in the last picture. Edited by KimT, 10 August 2008 - 01:28 PM."

As for the set itself, it has it's pros and cons in my eyes. I like all the minifigs, but especially the witch. The Fright Knights are probably the closest you can get for an evil human Castle faction. As for the building itself, on the other hand I like the fact that it can be modified, but some of the design choices are just stupid. The holes in the wall, the one huge tower (as opposed to several smaller ones), the huge empty space in the center, and the excessive usage of bright yellow. I guess for a smaller kid the play value is great, it's easily accessible and it looks sturdy enough, but to an AFOL, it's not much else than a source for bricks and figs, in my opinion. Oh, and they did have telescopes in the medieval times (the witch most probably uses it for astrology). And even if they didn't, we're talking about a castle with a dragon and a wicked witch in it, so it's not exactly a good example of accurate history."

This set always looked a bit too busy for my liking, I guess I just didn't expect to see a set so tall. After seeing your review though, it is growing on me. I like all the play features, and at the very least it's a great parts pack. Two things I'm confused about though. In this pic, is that dragon being used as a swing set? And I don't get why the area where the witch casts her spells on the second floor is green. Green in Castle means grass (or Forestmen... ), and having grass on the second floor of a building is just weird. I understand that it's modular and thus it would make sense if it were placed on the ground, but dark grey would make just as much sense, and would look much better than the green there IMO. Anyway, I'm just fussy. Thanks again for the cool review, will we be seeing any more? ~Peace"

As a member of classic-castle, the census always seemed to be that fright knights were a class 4/10 or 6/10 but as Sandy stated above, it is one of the closest you can get to an evil faction. By today's standards, the contraptions seen here are much much more sophisticated and well thought out and are definitely missing in 2007's King's Castle Siege. I enjoy the design of this castle much more even if the towers are taller simply because the design in the King's Castle Siege left builders with an empty space right in the courtyard without even a base plate! AND it's nearly impossible to get your hands in and play in the enclosed space (why would anyone unless you're simply posing figs, and even that was difficult). This Castle instead, had a variety of trap doors and surprises, so despite the varied colors used here, it's not that hard to realize that the designers for this Castle really took time to think things out and tried to make the Castle enjoyable for the children that will play with it whereas our 2007 Castle was strictly built to give kids the impression of an enormous magnificant Castle with little to nothing inside. It's like comparing beauty (2007) to brains (this castle). Edited by legobear, 20 July 2008 - 01:32 AM."

I am very sure the feeling is very nice, especially touching the bricks which is preserved for 11 years sealed in bags. I am quite fond of the Fright Knights theme. Unfortunately, this theme was released during my dark age. I never really bought sets from Fright Knights. Instead, I bought plenty of minifigs to build an army. If I could turn back time or find another MISB set with a reasonable price, I am very sure I will get it. My soldiers need a castle to stay in. I will be looking forward to your next review. Keep up the good job"

I was one of those who always thought this set looked lame, ever since first seeing it in the catalogue. A couple of my siblings had smaller Bat Lord/Fright Knight sets and enjoyed the accessories and style of the minifigs etc. So last year having not only ended my dark ages, but done so for some of the rest of my family, I got this set off ebay for my sister for Christmas. I of course had to build it to make sure all parts were there before leaving ebay feedback and ending the transaction. First impressions were of how much brick there was to the set, as well as really useful large structural elements. And to be honest, while perhaps a bit childish, there's no doubt the style of the minifigs is kinda cute and useful for customs. It was really enjoyable building this set, and the scale is impressive when built, empty spaces notwithstanding (but hey, Lego has always had buildings with no back, etc. - just use your imagination and enjoy the access to playspace offered). The traps etc. are neat and more like the kind of ""action features"" modern sets come with (I for one am in favour of these, for kids they are fun and I think for builders they give ideas cause they are often done with minimal parts or impact on the set design). Anyways, needless to say my sister loved the set. Indeed she's currently rebuilding it for the second time. If I see it as cheap again, I will pick up one for myself. I got the first one at €30 incl postage I believe."

I remember how badly I wanted that set when it was new... oh well... Definitely one of the most original castles, if not THE most. I actually liked how the 1st floor was made into a throne room. The tower looks pretty impressive, too. Of course, the castle has a flagrant flaw -- the walls on the sides are open. I also think it lacks in the minifig count, though that is understandable for a castle with a dragon. Quote The Fright Knights are probably the closest you can get for an evil human Castle faction. Totally agreed."

Recently, I acquired several more from Bricklink because I just really love the way they look. This theme really had good intentions, but the execution was flawed. I hope one day Lego returns to a darker tone, but maybe next time it could be more Castlevania inspired. That would really turn some heads! Plus, vampires and gothic aesthetics are really popular now. It will probably have run its course by the time Lego would be able to develop a theme around them, though."

The set offered new design elements not previously offered in previous sets. What really stands out for me is 1x3 car doors and torsos with printed designs. A decal was used for the large sign on the building and the #1 on the hood of one of the vehicles. I think this was also the first set to offer the sliding garage mechanism, a feature that added a great amount of realism and playability. The set also included two blue doors and the new fire hose with pre-connected faucet/spicket. Getting on to the pictures. I saved the cover of the box for this set but lost the instructions over the years. I was able to download some instructions from the web. Here's a shot of the box cover: And the back of the box: The set includes four figs, three of which are fireman, and a lady who can serve as a dispatcher. As mentioned above, the torsos are printed on: My favorite of the two vehicles included, I love the design of Fire Engine #1: I always loved the fire hoses included in this set. No string to have to tie or freyed ends: Engine #2 is this much larger engine with ladder. I like how it contains an oxygen tank and fire axe: On the other side of the engine are two shutter doors that reveal the hose and ladder controls. These are stickers: The ladder is much wider than previous Lego ladders and extends a good length: I like the baseplate of this set which has the numbers ONE and TWO marking each garage: The building is simple but has a nice design. I love the sliding garage doors: NOTE: Notice the two windows of the 2nd floor. The actual set should have blinds on these windows. I've lost one of the stickered windows, so placed the single blinded window on the 1st floor. Each of the two sides of the garages are the same. Here's a shot of the right side: On the first floor is the dispatch area and a classic blue Space computer: The 2nd floor has a bed and a chair: Here's a shot of the entire backside: And lastly, a shot of the entire station: This set is one of my favorite fire stations that offers a great amount of playability. Hope you enjoyed the review."

While is was good to use the hinged car roof - which was relatively new at the time - together with the inverted screen it was superceded very quickly by designs that stood the test of time far better (for example 6657). Also, I don't think I could everbuy a Lego fire helicopter because it is not something we have in the UK/Eire. Police, Coast Guard, Ambulance, military, etc, etc but no fire helicopters.

Snorkel Squad, in simple english terms, it refers to Fire Engine, fighting fire, always on standby, ready to save the citizens from crisis. Trust me, you will understand why this Snorkel Squad is superb impressive by the end of this review. On a side note, there is only part that is replaced by another color. Can you find the difference? Name: Snorkel Squad Theme: LEGO System / Town Year: 1987 Pieces: 151 Minifigs: 2 Price: USD$13.50 An image of a 6358, Snorkel Squad Looking smart on their stand-by This snorkel squad is a fanastic fire engine, that is ready to save people from the fires. It's primary color ""red"" is used in all fire emergency department and vehicles. In case of any emergency, this snorkel squad will be activated and arrived at the scene as soon as possible. No time to waste! Personally, this is the best fire engine that I had ever seen. Meet the Fire Fighters It comes with two brave fire fighters. Both of them wear the standard fire fighter outfit that is present in almost all Fire Station sets in Classic Town. The torso is very nice and formal, and looks real impressive onto them. I love the buttons on them. Furthermore, these white helmets are a symbol to the world of Fire Fighting. These are the people whom save lives by risking their own lives in dangerous situations. Water Hose compartment The water hose is a string that is stored in the front. It can be rolled out, and the fire fighters are able to use it without much difficulty. They will just pull out the hose and spray onto the fire. The next picture, shows a much clearer look in its interior. In addition, the fire logo that is on the compartment, is actually printed. Yes, it's not a sticker, and that is great news for us! Interesting features These clamps on both sides, is supposed to stablise the fire engine when the ladder is heading upwards. It is a simple mechanism, which illustrate clearly what it does. This feature is recently seen in Construction vehicle such as the Mobile Crane. Of course, it is not a complicated feature. It just made use of three quite common white parts. Swivel Mechanism These swivel mechanism, in my opnion are very fun to play with. These connectors on the front and the back, enable the long fire engine, to make sharp turns on any junctions, arriving at the scene fast enough. This is not a fire engine that only travel straight roads. Try it onto your base plates, and you will be surprised, how well it can turn. Best Playable mechanism in 6358 The driver will be activating the ladder at the back of the vehicle. In order, to adjust the height and making sure that the ladder do not fall short, the tiles on the plates are acting like a stoppage. The ladder are able to rotate 360 degree without much problem, if you removed the driver out of the control panel. It goes up as tall as 30cm! Look at that amazing height. Too bad, I have not constructed my Cafe Corner yet. Otherwise, I can give you a better feel of how amazing this baby can go. I used the old road baseplate as a guide, and roughly it can goes as tall as 30 to 35cm. Look at the black hinges below. By shifting it to the last, that was the maximum height it can move. This is a very good way to adjust the height. Oh, and I forget to mention that there are 2 storage compartments for the fighters to place their equipments behind. Quite easy to access. No doors? Apart from the standard roof top on the driver's seat, there is no doors present at both side. I am quite sad to see that there are no doors. Maybe, these fighters are supposed to jump off the seat, instead of opening the doors? Well, I guess this is the only major flaws that I had found in this set. Heading off *Got you* Meet the Model 6358 Fire Engine Summary review Playability: 10/10 (Superb fun. The ladder and swivel mechanism is really very fun to play with.) Design: 9.5/10 (Excellent design. It got an almost full 10. The lack of doors, dropped my ratings slightly.) Price: 8/10 (A very mid range price. I don't think it cost very expensive. But, I am not sure how much it cost now.) Overall: 9.2/10 (Best Fire Engine ever, and one of the great looking one too. Get this model now.) I gave it a ""5"" based on my Review Score Card. What about yours? Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. Comments and Critics are strongly welcomed. Pictures can be found in My Brickshelf (When moderated)"

I can remember the 6358 very vividly. My parents bought the 6340 for me and a girl friend got the 6358. I'm quiet sure it's my envy because until now I want to believe that the 6340 is better. My reasons were these: I own the 6340 (and on the instructions of the 6358 stood ""LEGOLAND"" which I thought of as old.) But this review induced me to get over this humiliation from my childhood ( ) and check ebay for the 6358. Edited by BerndDasBrot, 21 July 2008 - 04:07 PM."

Equally nice is the fire hose which extends a good length. The color combination of red with white and the trans. blue windshield looks goos as well. This is a great engine and one that would look perfect in a classic tabletown - and it's 4-studs wide! Very nice review WhiteFang. I look forward to seeing more of your Classic Town reviews.

This was one of my most favourite set in the late 1980s, and I am glad to restore it somehow, with a small little part missing, which could not be that hard to replace. BerndDasBrot, on Jul 22 2008, 12:06 AM, said: But this review induced me to get over this humiliation from my childhood ( ) and check ebay for the 6358. Bernd, I am glad reviews like these, mananged to change your perception towards this set. Honestly, this is a very good set to pass by, and I hope I had highlight the key features in this set. Hope you will have an easy time, getting it from eBay or Bricklink. rriggs, on Jul 22 2008, 12:31 AM, said: Great classic firemen and - in your version - a suspiciously blue fire extinguisher Good job, by spotting the replacement part, which is hiding among them. That's why I show the orignal image. Lord Of Pies, on Jul 22 2008, 12:34 AM, said: I can't help but feel thought that these reviews are being churned out to quickly, you should leave a gap, I am being flooded with all these great reviews! You should really take some time off, and sit in front of the Town and Trains forum, looking through at your childhood memories, where classic reviews like this are released in this forum. I am leaving some gaps in between my reviews now. I supposed Brickster will slow down soon. Captain green hair, on Jul 22 2008, 02:07 AM, said: This definitly is a nice set, i think this was also the first set to use that white basket CGH, you are absolutely right. This is the first set that made use of the white basket component. In fact, there is only 2 sets in the entire LEGO theme which have make used of the white basket. It is the 6477 which is released in 2000. I am quite surprised after 13 years, they are able to produced it again. TheBrickster, on Jul 22 2008, 10:10 AM, said: What an awesome little set!

I agreed with you, that Fire Engines need to be big and sturdy. On the other hand, it can be nice to have the fire engine to look slim as well, to cut through the traffic easily. I am not against with the newer sets. It just that, part of the reasons which reflected in the review had fufill the basic key factors of a typical Fire Engine.

The set is an excellent gravel yard scene complete with a garage, two very nice construction vehicles, a gravel sifter, construction building, and working crane. Starting with the instructions: A closer view of the front: And how about these for alternate models pictured on the backside of the instructions: The set includes four construction workers, all with the same uniform: Moving on to the vehicles, the first one is a front-end loader: The back of the vehicle has a construction decal and a bar to hold some tools: The set includes a great two-section dump truck. I love the big wheels used on both vehicles: A little office provides the workers a place to check in and get out of the sun: Inside is a desk and chair: On the outside of the building is a clock decal: Outside is a quarry for white 1x1 bricks. You'll also notice some tools nearby: One of the fun parts of the set is a crane that slides back and forth (from the sifter to the quarry) that has a working claw: Here's a close-up: I love the blue sifter which one can easily poor 1x1 bricks inside: A mechanism in the back slides out allowing for the bricks to fall from the sifter: And the garage holds two vehicles with red sliding garage doors. The garage sign is a decal: Here's a shot of the entire set: And the set pictured in Tabletown: I was not aware that this set was only available in the U.S. until seeing it on Brickset. I'm not sure if Europe had a similar set with another set #. If so, I was not able to find one. In any case, I hope you enjoyed this review of a great classic town set."

Are there any classic/vintage town sets that you like? The cars were simple, but we're talking early 80s. Everything was more simpler then. I actually like the cars, even today. I agree with you in regard to the stickers. A few of the town sets in the 80s did this. It always made taking the pieces apart very difficult. I didn't realize that this was a US set only. This is the kinda stuff you don't know about as a kid. welcomestranger, on Jul 22 2008, 07:27 AM, said: that office wouldn't be the best place to rest and relax with that big crane rumbling about overhead...

As mentioned indeed this set was not to be found in europe, although the vehicles where all released seperately. I own both of them. First of all, I liked from this time the addition of road-plates. I think it adds a lot of playability to the set as a stand-alone AND it easily makes you a city by combining a few sets. The office is not much, which is ashame, but still, the entire lay-out doesnt feel ""empty"" which is a very good thing. For me an excellent set to be combined with several others from its time with a very classic feeling."

I never thought they looked good as stand alone sets, and having those first initial sets with roadplates made me want to go out and buy more to add to them.

Too much of Brickster's reviews. Public Works Center certainly sounds quite nice to me. To me, this set seemed to be a construction site entrance, office and storage. It defintely offer lots of playabiliy. With this set up, it can easily blend into any Classic Town with that lovely road baseplates that has Lot 1 and 2 printed in front of it. The construction vehicles is pretty neat as well. As for the dump truck, the front section looks a little bare but the back and intersection looks awesome. The interior office has simple furniture for the admins or foreman to do their work in the cool air conditioner, avoiding the scorching sun. Outside seemed to be the reporting area for the workers to clock their cards. Garage seemed to be an uncommon sight these days, especially with its shutter. In fact, I am pretty fond of these shutters as it provide a much realistic touch in it. The best playing features in this set is defintely the crane and the sifter. You could use the crane to lift some bricks from the ground and transport it to other point such as the sifter. The sifter will process the bricks and drop into the dump truck, ready for land transportation. Despite of the set's age, it has actually showed how much fun you could have by playing it with different possible combinations. No doubt about it, I am going to give it a ""5"".

It is when small pieces are added (e.g., in Step 5, I believe, 1x1 blue plates are added to the blue ""stilts"" ...) or when pieces are placed in a line (e.g., Steps 12-15, building the Office) that it becomes difficult to see the additions or understand how a row is broken into pieces.

Several of the pieces included in that inventory don't end up in the build though, most notably the 2x2 Blue Brick. I had not seen the Peeron one and it appears to be slightly different. I'd need to take a bit to do a side-by-side comparison, though it does include the 2x2 Blue Brick, so I'm not sure what to make of that.

Additional information has been added as part of this 2008 review of 3225. Back in the early 2000s, I needed a small train for my western town layout and chose none other than 3225 Classic Train released in 1998. Sure, I could have chosen a MOT black steam engine with coal car, some green passenger coaches, and a nice red caboose, but there's something nostalgic about this little classic train. In fact, this train reminds me of the first 12V trains to hit blue track in the '70s (725 released in 1974 to be exact). This set originally sold for $66 U.S.D. available through LSAH (but I didn't purchase until 2002 over Ebay). I did get it MISB for $73 which was not a bad deal. This train includes four cars: a small engine, a tipper, a gondola, and a coach (some call a caboose); three mini-figs, a wheel-barrow, and a good variety of tools/cargo to load aboard the train. This set did include a motor but no track or speed regulator. Front of box: Back of box: The engine of this train reminds me more of a small German steam engine with its black color and red trim. It's build directly on the train motor using various small plates/bricks. The instructions do NOT include a way to add a light to the engine. Pictured without stickers: I love the large container of the yellow tipper: Tilting the tipper releases seven round 1x1 grey bricks. The only issue is that it sometimes sways open when running the train fast around the track: The brown gondola is very useful for transporting cargo. Included are two brown crates: one with 2 clear glasses and the other with a chain, a mail box with 1x2 mail plate, a garbage can, and a brown chest with a single 1x2 money plate. A view of the gondola from the top: The red coach is my favorite car. It has a removable roof and three green chairs for passengers. I did not attach stickers to both side walls. The windows are shaded blue which gives the car a cool look: Lifting off the roof makes this wagon very ""playable"" - fun to add passengers and watch them circle the track. The wheel-barrow to load the train: This set includes three figs. I really like these figs: And a nice selection of cargo: Although not an ""official"" Wild West set, here's some images of the train letting steam out in Gold City: Summary Before purchasing, I read a few reviews which weren't very good. Some criticized this set for not containing track and a speed regulator (making it incomplete) - fine for those who already have it. This set truly brings back early memories of Lego trains. It's fun and fairly quick to build (compared to a BNSF or a Super Chief). The set includes some very useful train parts and nice colored elements. I enjoyed building this train and setting up a layout around my western town. I think this is a nice nostalgic set for those of you who may look for one on Ebay; and lastly, its a fun train to run with its figs, accessories, and ""small"" narrow gage look. Larry Pieniazek of Adequate.com wrote a great story about this train as part of a set review, a number of years ago. Check it out: It's a sunny day in October 1898. With a shrill whistle, the noon local crests the hill and rounds the final curve into Durango. Exhaust huffs from the cylinders as the 0-4-0T slows to a stop, temporarily shrouded in a cloud of exhaust steam which the wind and sun make short work of. The bright goldwork on the engine gleams in the sunlight of the little Colorado mining town. The <-O-> logo and gold number 3225 in the side of the engine fairly glisten, as well they might, picked out in gold filigree. Life is good and the 20th century is almost here! The nattily turned out engineer in his yellow uniform blows a sharp blast on the cab mounted air horn to summon the local agent. Hard hat on, and clad in newfangled reflective gear the agent wheels the station barrow over to receive the urgent ore samples from the dump car, and begins to unload the high priority contents, with the help of the local mining agent clad in his jaunty white vest and striped tee. The mail is here, and what's this? Two crystal chalices have arrived for the mine owner's mansion, as well as some much needed saftey chain and the weekly payroll. The engineer clears the paperwork in his caboose and releases the freight to the agent. Just another day's work for the unsung heroes of the trusty <-O-> line. His complete review can be found here: 3225 Set Review on Adequate.com."

I had seen this set before in one of your Wild West set up. Glad you share it with us again. This set is very nice and promising. I had never own a train set before in my collections. Recently, I understand the difference between ""RC"" and ""9V"" train sets. Although I am not an expert in grading train sets, but I am just stating my views as a ""greenhorn"". This set has its advantages and disadvantages. To be fair, let me go through its advantages, from its review. The first compartment, which is the engine carriage as well. I love the antique black and red look, that used coal to fuel its power. Nice and classic, without excessive use of stickers! I am never a sticker lover, just stick it if its necessary. The large yellow container, is a great way to stow away debris, rocks, gold or whatever. I will leave it to your imagination. If I were to use it, I will probably use it in my Dwarf Mine, to carry gold and sliver, letting them push it back and forth. The stores compartment comes with a hefty good accessories, like treasure chest, brown crates, mail box and etc. A good way to seize good accessories to match with your MOCs or Town set-up. Anyway, the stores compartment do not restrict carrying such goods only. The red coach compartment, is my favourite of them all. The trans-blue window, gives us a great inside to its interior, where it can sit in 3 passengers comfortably. I will probably want to get this set, for its red coach, and add on 3 to 5 compartments, making it as a red passenger train. The mini-figs and the wheel barrow is really very sweet. This set appeared in my dark age, and I never had the slightest impression of seeing this set before, apart from viewing it in Brickster Wild West set up. As for its disadvantage, it will be the tracks and the speed regulator. I am surprised for a complete train set, like this did not come with essential train parts. It will not be good to have this, if this is your first train set. However, if this is not your first train set, I am sure you have plentiful of tracks, for this new model to run into your town. I wouldn't mind having this set. Furthermore, I will like to emphasized that this set is worth USD$66, which is affordable in my opnion. And, I believed the main reason for its ""low cost"" is due to its tracks and speed regulator. I will give this a ""5"", mainly for its red carriage and the classic engine facade, if you include a ""poll"" for it. Thanks Brickster, do educate members like me on train issues, and advice me what train sets to look out for in the future.

Did they actually think that this was a viable play alternative to buying actual tracking? Or were they just making sure that you didn't think you were getting track pieces included inside the box... I think the intent was just to show the items contained in the set, but it probably looked awkward without showing any track. I never had an issue with the boxart. Panda9001100, on Jul 22 2008, 09:46 AM, said: It's a very nice little train, by the way, great review. I like the little story . I only miss those connecting rods, which are on reallife steamengines. That's why I've rebuild mine for 12v track. Thanks Panda, although I can't take credit for the great story. I like your 12V layout a lot - nice rebuild. Thanks for all the great comments. I hope more take time to provide feedback."

I gave this set a 5: It's really a set which fills at bit the missing of a Western train in the WW theme. (That does not mean that I wouldn't like a new Western train !) I'm very lucky that I bought it some weeks ago from ebay. There are three different waggons and a little engine - everything you need for a nice train - and the desgin is perfect, too ! Of course the minifigs don't go with the Western theme very well - but that doesn't disturb me since there are only three. IMO excellent set which should really be redesigned ! Klaus-Dieter"

If so, if you don't mind me asking, what kind of price? No, it came without the box. The train is used - but in a very good condition (nearly all stickers are there ). I had to pay 90 Euros for it. Imo it's not cheap but it isn't too expensive since the 9 V motor is included, too. I had the luck to buy a very reasonably priced transformer and some good 9 V tracks, too - so that I all in all had to pay around 120 Euros for the train, the transformer and a nice track circle. And I think that that's really ok since all the new trains cost minimum 100 Euros. Klaus-Dieter Edited by Klaus-Dieter, 24 July 2008 - 06:36 PM."

I had intentions of getting either the Coast Gaurd Boat and tower to add to my Coast Gaurd collection, or if they had it the new 1:9 scale ferrari F1. While both sets were there, i cameacross this beauty! I wasn't sure at first, and i acctually left the store and thought about whitch one of the Three i really wanted. Afterone of the most difficult Lego purchasing desisions iv'eever made, i decided that the ferry was the most unquie and made my purchase (or my beautiful girl friend janie did at least ) Well enough of that, on with the review!! Lets start with the small first. In this case it will be the little truck and travel trailer or ""caravan"" to those from europe. Its a basic 4 wide SUV with some round hinge plates to simulate aroof rack, and some ""2.5x1"" slope bricks to simulate a roof top cargo carrier. Unfortunetly, the SUV can't fit a mini fig inside. The trailer is small in size, but has good detail. I like the the sloped roof and windows. I'm kind of disapointed that the truck and travel trailer wasn't quite made to mini figure scale, but its nothing a little mocing can't fix! Now on to the cream of the crop,.... The Ferry! letsstart from the front and work our way back. Being a creator set, asone would expect, this is intirely a brick built set. No big ""juniorized""pieces that some people don't like. The front of the hole is intirely brick built. using 3x1 slanted bricks. I think it looks great! Next we have the control tower. There is quite a bit of detail going on here. Here you can see the front deck lights, as the pilot lights and all of the radio antenas and radar dishes. In side, there is a sterring wheel and control levers. At both edges of the control tower are little binoculars for looking down the coastline. Its a really small, but at the same time a very ""big"" detail that really adds to the realisim of the set. Sorry, i thought i had taken a close up pic of this, but i didn't. Hopfully you can see it in this pic. Behind the tower is a nice little life boat. Its small, but high in detail and another great little touch. Now on to the main event. The front of the hull opens up to allow vehicles accses to the main deck. To open up first you need to unlock the front bow. The opening of the bow is controled by a techinic gears on both sides of the hull here... you can also see the life savers on the side of the hull, and the ancor. The opening of the bow. Its alsoimportant to pointout that the as the bow is opened and closed, the front loading ramp is also rasied and lowered at the same time. There linked toeghter via technic peices and ball and sockets. The next shot shows the front of the bow fully opened and gives a good shot of the transport deck. here we have a shot of the rear of the ferry. Here you can see the rear loading ramp and the mechanisim to lift it. Its controled using the same black technic gear as the bow. Its conected to some lift arma, whitch are then conected to chains. As gear is turned it lifts up the arm, in turn lifting the rear loadind ramp. One important thing i should note,is that the front loadind ramp is really only able to fit a vehisle thats max seven wide, or the withe of the inluded red SUV. The rear loading ramp is cable of handling 8 wide vehicles,witch i will demonstrate later. here we have a shot of the bottom of the ship, and how glides across the ground. It uses 4 off center air plane landing gears. This alows it to move practicly in any direction on a smooth surface. here are a few shots of some vehicles loaded on the deck. This is were having 4 wide vehicles in your gleet comes in handy. you could easily fit 4 four wide cars/trucks on the deck of the ferry. Five, and six wide could fit too, but it will be tight. A shot of just the SUV and Travel trailer exiting the front of the ferry. Now i promised i would ellaborate on the size of the loading deck ofthis beast, and that i will do. Whats this? Looks like the local frieght company needs some help getting one of thier cargo trucks across the river. The crew isn't sure if both the truck and its trailer will fit, but their going to give it a go! Its a tight fit, but she made it!! At $69.99 U.S., with 1,279 pieces this set is a fantasic value. It has great playability while still having enough detail to make a nice display model. Price per peice count- - - - - playability- - - - - design- - - - - Although its a creator set and not city, it would have been nice to fit a mini fig in the tower and vehicles. build- - - - Nothing really speacial in the build, but it was straight forward.

A very special thanks for your views on the loading capability. I never would have thought the truck would fit in the ferry, but it´s great to see it does! I had the chance to hold this set in my hands during our event and the opening mechanism is absolutely stunning! It all works so well I couldn´t close my mouth. Like you mentionend already, the gates open and the platform is lowering at the same time. You must have done that yourself to realize how ingeniously it is build. This is definitely on my wanted list, but my wife told me not to buy any Lego any more this year. Well, she said this year, so I will order mine 1.1.09. This is a perfect 10/10 in my opinion.

This is one of the most impressive Creator set, I had ever seen, apart from Creator houses. All of the Creator houses are just so beautiful. Ok, back to the review. The SUV is sweet, but it's sad to know that mini-fig can't drive this around. I believe, with slight modification, it will enable it place a driver in it somehow. This vehicle reminds me of the holiday camper set or vacation set, where the people could take a relaxing vacation on the road. The scale of the ferry is really very huge, and it is able to ferry quite a few 4-studs cars in it. Most importantly, I am glad you drive the truck with its trailer, loading it into the ferry. It sure fits well in it. This set is just so wonderful, especially with its alternate model of a cargo plane."

The soldiers only: And the pirates only: The Back/Inside is rather plain because it is in the water, but at least there's a treasure chest on the right and 2 guns on the left: One floor higher there's a small table with a goblet and a map for the pirate captain: You can open the floor where the table is on, and to light comes this little gun holder: On the very top the pirates can watch out for ships to plunder and then move barrels or something else with the crane: Back on the ground level, again the 2 hidden guns on the side from the tower: And at the front the ""skull-door"" opened: At the left back corner there's a barrel with some more guns and a palm tree. I like the use of the hammer to attach the branch to the tower: And finally at the front of the landing stage there is a cannon: In my opinion this is one of the best pirate sets ever made beside the ships, it's got great playability, and the skull-like door is designed very well also. You got plenty of minifigs, along with an ape and a parrot, and also lots of guns. Clearly a 10/10 for me, Pirates ON!"

It would be useful for the Classic-Pirates frontpage Anyway, onto the set. It is perfect. It really is the ultimate shanty port - it symbolises what the Lego Pirate theme was. All the exciting details - like the hidden weapon rack - are truly fantastic, as is all that landscaping. The two boats are great for playability, and the rum/wine in the barrels is a lovely rare touch I really would have loved to own this set at the time. I especially love the interesting drink thing - sort of a decanter..."

This was most likely the biggest set I owned back in my childhood (I've bought bigger ones in the last few months, though), and I remember playing with this to no end - of course adding my Paradisa-girls and other pirates to the crew as well. I may have been a tom-boy, but I would've never played with only boy minifigs. I just love all the details and the Caribbean feel to it. It comes with many useful pieces as well, and I totally rate this set 5/5 - for old time's sake!"

I've been saving the review as it has always been one of my favorite classic town sets. With a hotel, drivers school, 8 figs, 2 vehicles, construction crane, and lots of extras, this set was a gem when released in the early 80s. My set is intact with one missing minifig (the chef, which I found in a jar a few years ago, but can not seem to find now), and two of the black round 2x4s (which can easily be replaced). 6390 Main Street was re-released in 2003 as Legend #10041. I also own the Legend, which I had to purchase as a fresh new set. I wish Lego would re-release some more of these great classic town sets! Starting with the instructions: And the backside: Notice the crane removed and replaced with a Legoland Hotel sign which was a decal you could place on one of the crane beams. Also pictured in the instructions: The set includes 8 minifigs (isn't that a lot of figs?) The printed torsos were very nice. These are the originals: The Construction Crew (I love the red zipper torsos) And the others including Cowboy, Police, Princess, and the missing Chef. The female torso with necklace was also used in the earliest Knights Tournament set: I've always loved this little truck which I've wanted to use in a desert MOC: The backside of the truck: And the yellow ""Drivers' School"" vehicle: Another great 4-stud wide car! The set included some wonderful printed signs, later being replaced with stickers in the Legend: The great popcorn stand (which is a decal). The ubrella is a printed piece: A simple park bench rests nearby: What Main Street would be complete without a gas lamp? I've always liked this simple, yet effective design: The set includes the large cypress tree and smaller bush tree: An excellent crane stands outside the Legoland Hotel: One could pull up the building components with the rope: A control cockpit is attached to the upper section of the crane: The official Legoland Hotel: Check out the fancy entrance: My only complaint is Lego forgot to furnish it (budget cuts and all, or perhaps construction was never completed???) A nice feature of this building is that you can easily break away the wall sections and hoist them up with the crane. My favorite building was always this Western-style Drivers' School: The sign is a decal. I love the door design: And the arches in red with white inside: The 1st floor doesn't contain two much but does have room for the little yellow car: But students can take their written exam upstairs: Here's an image of the complete set, left perspective: The right perspective: And from a pigeon's view: This set is definately a ""10"" in my book. I use to add brick horses and pretend the Drivers' School was a saloon (destine to be a fan of the Wild West collection). Hope you enjoy this review of my ""true classic""/vintage sets."

I'm pretty sure this is LEGO's only attempt at a hotel as an official set, which is odd. I used to love staying in hotels as a kid and had more personal experience with those than a bank or post office, of which LEGO made multiple sets. I like how the crane can be dismantled and the parts used to finish the hotel. Not fond of the vehicles but I understand that was the style back then. It's still an amazing set (5/5) and I wish I had gotten the Legend rerelease."

Yes, this is easily one of the best Town sets ever released. The design is fantastic, and there are a lot of cool features. I believe this is the only set that has a drivers school and a building in construction, which makes it all the more special. Plus, there's tons of acessories like trees, flowers, road signs, street lamps, and even a bench and popcorn machines. And to top it off, you get two vehicles, a crane, and NINE figures! There really isn't anything much to complain about at all, which is why I give it a perfect score of 5/5. Quote 6390 Main Street was re-released in 2003 as Legend #10041. I also own the Legend, which I had to purchase as a fresh new set. I wish Lego would re-release some more of these great classic town sets! I believe that the reason that TLC started doing the Legends series year ago was because a lot of the modern sets were terrible - especially the town - so they may have thought it was easier to release old kits than to make new kits. Since now they have the much better City line (which is selling REALLY well), there is really no need to make any more Legends, buisness-wise. Edited by Grevious, 28 July 2008 - 03:13 PM."

I voted for Above Average: Of course there regrettably were missing some more detailed accessories mainly for the hotel. But you have to consider that this set was released (the first time) a long time ago. And because of that I think it is amzing detailed . I mainly really this garage with the office upstairs - that was simply . Civilian stuff and buildings (with which I mean not the always only police, construction, fire and rescue - and with which I mean mainly civilian life in the city) were and regrettably still are a real shortcoming in the City theme (in other themes like Castle, too, but the most bothersome it's imo in the City theme). I bought the rereleased version (which regrettably didn't inlcude the lovely cypress ) some years ago - and I must say that I really don't regret it. Klaus-Dieter"

I just think it would be interesting! Great review! I enjoyed it the first time it was posted and enjoyed reading it again in the thread revival! First of all, I came asking the same question myself. I did a quick inventory analysis on Bricklink and the most obvious difference is the original set 6390 comes with the super-rare ""cypress tree"" piece #3778 while the reissue, set # 10041, does not. Also, Set 6390 comes with 4 outstanding #812 peices, ""Light Gray Train Level Crossing Center Rail Cap Insert 2 x 14 x 2/3"" which serve as rails for the crane to slide on and also play a double role as the backing for the ""Legoland Hotel"" sticker once the crane has been used to build the hotel. These pieces are very iconic and only came in 6 sets during the late 70's and early 80's. They are not included with set 10041, which instead uses standard tiles to build the rails. I know that this information helped me when looking to buy this set, and I hope it helps you too!"

This is a very small set, and can be considered as part of current Impulse set series. This ranger vehicle is always on the move, making sure everything is in order! With his trusty mini-jeep, he is able to travel to different points at a very relative fast speed. Name: Trail Ranger Theme: LEGO System / Town Year: 1994 Pieces: 34 Minifigs: 1 Price: USD$3.25 An image of a 6514, Trail Ranger Let the ride begins Trail Ranger is a 4-studs wide vehicle and looks very nice and wonderful with its yellow combination. Somehow, this design reminded me of the Adventurers theme and Indiana Jones theme. Quite handy to make use of this vehicle to travel rough terrain. Great for traveling long expedition. The driver wears a green vest with patch pockets on both sides. Personally, I like the design of his vest. If you have noticed, he is wearing a blue sunglass and stubble pattern on its face. Just to add in abit of interesting information. This head design is only available in most town sets from 1993 to 1994. After that, this design is no longer in use. I wonder why? Simple design This is a very simple design that made used of mostly yellow bricks. Not a very big and complicated vehicle, I am sure most of you are able to do reverse engineering on this set without much diffculty though. However, locating the yellow car base can be quite a problem. My favourite part These tilted blue panel are great for doing MOCs for other cars that can be used as a windscreen. Not a very rare part, but an useful part indeed. Different angles of the vehicle Ready to go for patrol Summary review Playability: 7.5/10 (Not much playability involved, except using it to cruise down the roads) Design: 8/10 (Very very simple design. It's just an impulse set, what can you expect?) Price: 10/10 (A very inexpensive set based on the 1994 pricing. Great way to buy many mini-size jeeps to sell in your town) Overall: 8.5/10 (This vehicle is a ""nice to have"" kind of vehicle. Well, I love the simplicity, but its defintely not a must to have in every town.) I gave it a ""4"" based on my Review Score Card. What about yours?

Opps, my vehicle had gone through a terrible sandstorm earlier, and was not in time for the car wash before taking its exhibition shots. I always used this set, as a patrol car. And now, this set is part of my Indiana Jones companions. Although the face of the driver looks odd when you compared against these fleshies, but I always thought of this vehicle using as an ""Outback"" as well."

I have all been into Space at the time the set was released, so I don´t own many of those town sets. I wonder that you are showing 7 photos for just 34 bricks. That is what I would call an excellent pic-per-brick ratio. Well, 3 pics would have been enough for such a small set, eh? WhiteFang, on Jul 26 2008, 08:25 PM, said: ... Summary review Playability: 7.5/10 (Not much playability involved, except using it to cruise down the roads) Design: 8/10 (Very very simple design. It's just an impulse set, what can you expect?) Price: 10/10 (A very inexpensive set based on the 1994 pricing. Great way to buy many mini-size jeeps to sell in your town) Overall: 8.5/10 (This vehicle is a ""nice to have"" kind of vehicle. Well, I love the simplicity, but its defintely not a must to have in every town.) I gave it a ""4"" based on my Review Score Card. What about yours? I cannot follow you in your evaluation. On the one hand you say 'not much playability', but rate it 7.5 and the design is described 'very very simple', but still has 8 out of 10 points. I agree with your explanation but would give it 5/10 for playability (or even less) and 4/10 for design, resulting in an overall rate of 6/10. In my opinion that would suite this set better. It´s nice, but there´s nothing really special worth mentioning on this set. I rated it ""3"". btw.: You should consider dusting your sets..."

Firstly, I must apologise that I am trying to improve the presentation format of the evaluation system. I used 3 critical factors which are playability, design and price. For every score given out of 10, I will give a very brief comment beside it. Playability refer to your imagination and creativity, of what you could do to play with this offical set, without modification or add-on. Trail ranger could allow us to have a new vehicle type in a town. It can be used it for Indiana Jones adventure, Adventurers and Outback, in my opnion, due to its design. Although the design is very simple, but I increase the rating much higher, as I compared it as an Impulse set standards. That's why, my rating for design is slightly higher than playability. As for pricing, this is a very subjective matter, which differ greatly due to currency exchange and inflation. If my rating or final score has any misleading, it will not be very effective as well. Most of the time, I tend not to be too harsh to the sets. Thanks for explaining to me, on how you rated this set. It's nice to know how other members felt, and this is how a review should be, exchanging views and ideas. Holodoc, on Jul 30 2008, 05:16 AM, said: btw.: You should consider dusting your sets... Thanks Doctor! All my old town sets required heavy cleaning."

Today, I went to my local target and purchased the AT-TE and the RGS, but heres my AT-TE review: Alright, let me just say, that this thing is MONSTROUS! the box is huge but it is dwarfed by the size of the RGS box. Once again, Lego makes the box twice as large as necessary... I only got one building shot so here it is: The Build: It is a fun build, although too much technic for my liking, it is pretty easy except for one thing that pissed me off. Lego does NOT number the bags, so you have to dig around in each separate bag for what your looking for, made the build twice as long as it could have been. It took me roughly 4 hours with some breaks, so be prepared to invest some time making this. The 'Figs: the figs are OKAY, but with 8 chairs to fill, and only 2 clones, it is kind of disappointing, the Battle droid and STAP are a nice addition though: Anakin+Ahsoka+Big Blob'o'crap. Personally I don't really like the new faces, or that theres more non-clones than clones in this set, isn't it the CLONE WARS?! I beleive Lego is skimping on clones because their making their own giant battle. Other Assorted Info+More Pics: One thing that also is kind of sad is the interior, it is like a skeleton, like if you had to ride in this thing you would fall out, so plan on modding this set. RATINGS: Price to parts: 8/10 For 799 pieces 79.99 would be perfect, but LEGO had to be mean. Minfigs: 7.5/10 Only the clones are good here in my opinion. Detail: 7/10 The exterior looks good, but the interior needs to be modded, it is SKELETAL! SKELETAL!!!! Parts: 10/10 The parts are cool, like the ball turrets, and the turret on the top is cool. Availability: 10/10 Unless you live in a backwater town of 500, it should be 10/10. FINAL SCORE: 8.7891/10 I love this set, I missed the first one, and this one is great, but it could be better."

I just took a little break from building mine and opened this up, and the first pic in this thread is the exact stage I am at right now. Strange... Anyway, nice review. I like this set and I thought the fact that the parts came in unnumbered bags is a good thing. I like it better this way; it's like making a puzzle: Most of the fun lies in finding the right piece, and as long as the build takes, the longer the fun lasts. Other than that, I found the build rather repetitive. Also, I think that the fact that you have to mod the interior is kinda good as well. It gives you the opportunity to build in anything you want. And I am more satisfied with the figs than you are, too. I like Anime Skywalker's hair and the fact that Rota's arms are posable, and the Asokah fig is a very interesting one, even though she looks like she gained a few pounds. Just look at the comparison:"

I'm glad I'm saving this one till later in my purchasing cycle. All the SW walkers have a skeletal fram with almost nothing inside. It's very disappointing, but I guess filling them in would up the piece count considerably. Does this beast have any good handholds for picking it up? I seem to recall a handle or something coming out of the top in the pre-release pics."

Skeletal interior and lack of clones? Although I didn't realize it didn't have numbered backs. That really is just ridiculous. LEGO finally comes up with a very intelligent solution to the frustration seen when building large sets, but then they neglect to implement it. WTF? Lame. Still, this may be the only Clone Wars set I buy besides the exclusives. The exterior, which IMO is the only part that matters, looks so fantastic. I don't care about clones, I have enough of those already. And at 90$ it's still a better buy than the RGS. The Torrent is cool but not as cool as the Fighter Tank or DGS imo. Awesome in-construction pics."

I have just finished building all of the legs, and so far it looks like it is going to be a great set. I would have like it if more clones were included, but whatever. I find it interesting how many clone accessories they give you. I don't like it only because I can't decide what I want to use. I find it interesting that at lease 2 people are missing pieces. I have had multiple times where I thought I was missing pieces, only to find that they were in the bag somewhere. Other than the fact that there is a lack of minifigures, I love this set and can't wait to finish it later tonight. Edited by SWMAN, 04 August 2008 - 08:33 PM."

It is pretty sturdy and heavy, that's where the handle comes in. I'm pissed that you only get 2 clones. Rex has to fight on the ground while you need more clones to man the guns/cockpit. The legs were the most annoying and time consuming part of the build. And yea I agree, that if TLG had made numbered bags, it would have taken only 2 hours rather than 4.

It's amazing how the paneling comes together to make such a tight fit, but can easily open up. The legs could have been a bit more poseable, and the guns don't launch easily unless you push hard and fast. I'd like the firing mechanism to launch more smoothly. But it looks absolutely amazing. About price, it was ¥13,000 where I am, but I'm used to Lego being expensive in Japan, so it was good value."

I saw all of the topics that I missed, and noticed a mini-review and a review with one pic, so I thought I'd make a huge, shiny new review that has lots of pictures and all of the requirements of KimT's index. NOTE: I did not apply any stickers to it, as a personal liking. So, lets start by looking at the box: A shiny, clean, and futuristic box, quite different from the other Star Wars box designs before this. There was so much Clone Wars merchandise with this font and design in the huge display at the front of my local Toys r Us store, and not just LEGO. It so beautiful, with the white and sky blue... anyways, for some reason, the boxes of the new Clone Wars sets seemed more shiny than usual. Maybe it's because they were just shipped, but once you pick up the boxes, they will feel really good in your hands, despite the fact that only about half of the space in the boxes are used... The back of the box: The back shows all of the main features of the set, plus pictures of the three other Clone Wars sets meant to be released alongside this one (although I did spot the Twilight and Homing Spider Droid, which were supposed to be released in September or October). So, on to the Gunship: Built straight from the bags. It took me about 4 1/2 hours, with breaks. It has an overall great design, but somewhat fragile, especially when building it. The cockpits always fall apart when opened, as well as the bubbles on the wings (which I will get into more later). The color scheme is very well done. You can always find the piece you're looking for thanks to the color diversity: Red, Dark Red, Lime Green (ooh!), Blue, Black, Tan, Light Bley, Dark Grey, Yellow and White. Also, split down the middle vertically, the ship is almost all symmetrical. Front: Side: Now, lets start with the many features that this set is hiding. The front has lots of lime green, a rare color. But more importantly: ...a rotating gun is found on each side. They rotate in a pretty wide range, although fragile. Cockpits: There are two main cockpits, right next to each other. Not very detailed, and are the same. And for some reason, the whole cockpit element flips up to reveal: ...nothing. Just the skeleton of the ship. Probe droid storage: Above the cockpit lies a plate that can be flipped up to reveal a storage area that holds: Two of these probe droids. At least, that's what I think they are. Hull: In this pic, two features are hidden. Mobile Command Center: The first of the two is a Mobile Command Center, but essentially just a hover chair. It is found by flipping up the two panels on either side of the hull. Bacta Tank: The second is the bacta tank found by just sliding it out of the storage area behind the MCC. One half of the tank opens: ...so a minifigure can go inside and heal his/her wounds obtained in battle. Cargo hold: Now, this is probably the main feature for this set. The two sliding doors (two on each side) slide open thanks to a clever Technic mechanism. Not much in here, just a gun holder and a place where the passengers wait to be dropped off in battle. Speeder Bike: I guess you guys saw it, the speeder bike. It is found by opening the rear flap. The bike is very cleverly designed by using a brown trike body. It's only a few centimeters shorter than the bike found in the Clone Battle Pack. Rear gun: Just a gun similar to the front ones. Engines: Huge engines (or are they cannons?) that are really fun to build. They really give that cartoon feel to this set. Missiles: In between the engines are two sets of four flick-fire missiles. Bubble cockpits: There is one bubble cockpit on each wing that supposedly control the turrets at the front. Very fragile. Storage containers: Two storage containers on each side hold the clone accessories. But, I wouldn't recommend putting them in there, because the antennae can fall out, or you might forget about them. Sticker Sheet: The Dreaded Sticker Sheet (DSS) has all of the stickers you need for this set. Unfortunately, mine was crunched up. I don't like stickers much anyways, but I might still apply some. Note the Republic symbol stickers, why couldn't TLG just use that printed piece from a few years back? Also, you get to choose between a bird-rat thing or a sleeping Twi'elk as your hull decal. What they're for, I don't know, looks like the movie or show will explain it though. Minifigs: Finally, the five minifigs of this set. They are all great figs, including: Commander Cody: Amazing, especially with the gear. The orange is nice, but I thought he was yellow. Clone Trooper: Again, amazing. The gear is great, and the new helmet and torso are great! All of the clones in the Clone Wars line have the same heads. Also, you can see the flesh beneath the helmet. Asaaj Ventress: Not so happy about this one. The torso and dark blue legs are cool, but the dress is pretty ugly. The head is alright, but could do without the cartoon-y face (yeah I know, its from a cartoon). Also has purple markings on back of head. Obi-Wan Kenobi: Pretty cool, besides the face. Cool hair and torso, though. Plo Koon: Beautiful! The true gem of this set, in my opinion. The head is the same material as Kit Fisto's. And the tosro is awesome, good for making a custom Ki-Adi Mundi. Well, that's about it, here is the... FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, very fun and easy, should take the seasoned builder about 4 hours. Somewhat fragile. Playability: 9.5/10, Lots of fun features, although some can break easily. Swooshability: 3/10, I wouldn't recommend flying it around much, as you can barely pick it up safely. But with two hands gripping the bottom firmly, it can be moved around, but not spun or swooshed, etc. Minifigs: 8/10, all very great figs, especially Plo Koon, but could have included more clone troopers. Design: 7.5/10, some excellent ideas included in here, although some spots are very fragile. Price: 7/10: Should have been only 100 USD if not for the new molds. Plus, at TRU, it was 130 USD. Overall score: 8.5/10, a great set to have for your star wars/ clone wars collection, with some flaws. Save up for this one. So, how did you like my review? Your feedback is much appreciated!

Keep up the good job Back to the RGS, this is the next Star Wars set I will be getting. I can't wait to lay my hands on this set, and start building. Basically, how bad this set can be, it can't be worse. Republic Gunship is one of the all-time favourites, in Star Wars Prequel and OT. I can't find any faults, except being too expensive due to the licence cost. In addition, the mini-figs are the next big thing. Seriously, I am quite impressed with it. On the down side, my rating will go up if there is an additional Clone Trooper instead of one. Nevertheless, this is a ""MUST GET"" set, no matter what!"

We had a fantastic time and it gave me the chance to pick up some of the new Castle sets and battlepacks I was really impressed by the sets I bought and decided to do my first review... let battle commence! Set name: Tower Raid Set number: 7037 Price GBP: £19.99 Pieces: 364 The Models Here's a shot of the complete set: The set is made up of two models, the Crown Knight's tower and the Orc's siege tower. Let's start with the Crown Knight's tower: A knight readies himself for battle! My favourite model from the set, the wicked Orc's siege tower: Please note that for the purposes of display I mounted the Orc's banner onto a small cone set on the top platform of the siege tower. This doesn't come with the set but saves any Orcs having to hold onto it all he time! There are other areas it can be placed without using extra parts. Features Both models look great and have excellent features. The set as a whole has great playability and seems to have been concieved with a storyline: the Crown Knight's have a captured Orc within the walls of their tower so the Orc army has been sent out to recover him... or are they merely after the gold the knights keep horded away?! The Orc's siege tower has a powerful ram - spring-loaded by the simple arrangement of an elastic band - so pulling it back sends it flying out the front, knocking down the wall on the side of the knight's tower... ...and releasing the captive Orc! The floor panels inside the prison are laid over a lip on the inside of the collapsible wall, so fall in when they're not supported. There's a string at the rear for extending the boarding ramp... ...and letting a fearsome Orc warrior charge across! Flick-fire action! The battle heats up as the Orcs close in! The Minifigures The Crown Knights: I really like the Crown Knights. They're metallic helmets look great and they come with nice accessories. The archer has a double printed head with a frightened look on the other side too! I'm not surprised, I'd be frightened when staring over the ramparts at these... The Orcs: These guys really do look the part, worthy advesaries to the Crown Knights! The details are superb: the printed elements, weapons and helmets, all set the Orcs aside on the battlefield. The set comes with a great new molded armour neckpiece too. The mighty Orc leader looks wicked in his full battlegear! Overview There's so much to this set it's hard not to be impressed. The Orc's siege engine is a thing of beauty (or terror!) and would look great on any battlefield. The Crown Knight's tower although basic, looks good and has great playability. I'm a big fan of the new Castle knights and fantasy minifigures and the inclusion of five of them is just enough for this set and as a booster to any army. At £19.99 in the UK this set is well worth the money for content and quality. I'd highly recommmend this set as a must-have purchase for anyone A final shot of the siege tower with a host of Orcs ready for battle: I hope you enjoyed my review, I'll be posting my next one for 7040 Dwarves Mine Defender soon!"

Granted, I couldn't afford all of them, but I do have most of them now. Anyway, I love the action elements to this set, and the siege tower really does look wicked. I'd like to attach the Crownie tower to the King's Castle to see how it fits, but I unfortunately don't own that set (yet). I also love the turning head of the soldier, and I've used it in my Princess Quest-comic as well, along with the turning head of the princess. The Troll Leader brings good variety to the army of trolls, but they still could use another face type and more torso options. It's a nice review, in any case, although the set pretty much speaks for itself."

I also got this set just recently, and I wasn't very enthusiastic about it at the beginning, but after I built it I could appreciate it. The siege engine is very nice, but my complaint has do with the proportions of the knight's tower in respect to the trolls' machine - it's a bit smaller, and less bulkier. That complaint has to go with some other sets too. For example the troll warship is really humongous - it feels like it can load the evil wizard's tower and sail off. Other than that - a good set, I like it, 4/5 from me."

Based upon this review I've placed an order for this set (along with some convincing from Amazon's 20% sale ). The only drawbacks in this set that I can see concerns the tower with it being 1) small compared to the seige tower and 2) missing a few walls. However, this is also the joy of LEGO as one can simply purchase a few bricks and build their own walls and/or expand the tower's size (or even attach it to a castle). Of course, this increases the price of the set, but considering how cheap bricks are on BrickLink, Tower Raid is still a very good value. I hope you continue doing reviews, pedro."

MagnaGuards: The Normal Box Stuff: Front of the ship: Back: Open Cockpit: Back of the Box: Contents: DSS (dreaded sticker sheet): First Manual Page (because it's super important not to build on carpet. ) Fig Build: The Magna Guard Head: (IMO it's beautiful! ) The Purple Cone! Cape Box: The Capes!: Just One: The MagnaGuard: Back: The Parts (nicely sorted!) The new Windshield Piece (Beautiful!) The First Step: Seccond Step: More Steps Of The Main Body: The Wing Assembly: (Sorry for the blur) Attached: Opposite Wing: Both Attached: Rear Engine Build: The Staffs. I have mine set up differently than in the instructions. I put one cone over the hump on one end of the staff, and the other in the original spot. Then, to load them onto the fighter, all you do is push the original placed cone down and put it right in. This way, the staff looks better and it works the same! See? It slides right in: Skeletal parts of sides attached: Close Up: Bottom: Both Wings Attached: Hidden Missle Launcher: Raised Up: Another Shot: Staffs Attached: Complete: Side Panel: Side Pods: Complete: Swooshable!: Finished!: Time to complete: >2hrs. Okay, Overall rating time! PRICE: 9/10- Could have been 40.00 USD, but due to new molds, this is understandable. PARTS: 9/10- Could have hade more Dark Red, but thats IMO. Plus, I love Dark Red! BUILD TIME: 8/10- I took my time on this and enjoyed the techniques the designers intricated. Also, taking pics added to the time quite a bit. PLAYABILITY: 7/10- The main playability functions are the missle launchers in the back and the sliding cockpit. My only gripe with these is they don't set right with the other slopes on the top. Also, the inside of the cockpit is easily modded for regular size minifigs. Just pop a handlebar piece in the already provided arm in the cockpit and bam, your favorite figs can have a ride! It also helps keep the Magnaguards in place if they hold it. MINIFIGS: 10/10- IMO, the new molds are great! The only downfall is the right arm on both is less moveable due to the hard plastic turban-thing connected to the head. SWOOSHABILITY: 9/10- The starfighter is pretty sleek, and very swooshable! DESIGN: 9/10- The most important aspect, and this one's a winner! It's only a nine because it needs to have smoother edges in a few spots, but they are easily MODable. OVERALL SCORE: 8.7! I think it's an awesome set. Very satisfying! 2008 SW ON! DSR DSR Edited by KimT, 04 August 2008 - 11:49 AM. indexed"

Anyway, it’s a great little set with a good price point, so I’ve decided to do my second review on it... chaaaaarge! Set name: Dwarves’ Mine Defender Set number: 7040 Price GBP: £6.99 Pieces: 86 The Model Here's a shot of the complete set: The Dwarven war machine - note the elastic band from wheel to blades: ""It's comin' right at us, Snotlick! Ruuuuun!"" Features The machine is a basic build but looks good. As seen above the front of the Dwarves' machine boasts several circular blades of death. These are attached by an elastic band to a tile with pin mounted on the front right wheel: the idea being that when the wheel turns, the blades spin. Unfortunately this doesn't quite work as well as it should as the wheels sometimes can't get enough friction to turn at all - laminate floors and soft carpets are a definite no-no! Certain surfaces it works just fine and the action is great when it does. As a suggestion, if you really want to get those blades working when moving the machine across your glass table, kitchen worktop, etc. try putting an elastic band around the front wheel for extra friction. That should gets those blades spinnning! Here's the back of the Mine Defender with catapult and chain: Pulling on the chain launches the catapult forward, deploying it's armament onto some unlucky Orc's head. That'll hurt in the morning! The Minifigures Three minifigures in all, one Dwarf and two Orcs: a warrior and a standard bearer. The Dwarf minifigures are pretty special, so it's nice to be able to get one cheap. He comes with a really nice metallic silver winged helmet and a great dark-orange beard neck-piece. Under that beard is one of the Crown Knights printed chain-mail torsos, which doesn't really add or take anything from the minifigure as you can't see it. All in all he's a smashing wee character! I've included a rear view of the minifigs so you can see the back of the Dwarf's ace little neck/hair-piece: Overview For being such a small set, Lego have managed to include some great minifigures and tried to pack in as much playability with some interesting features. The war machine can be a little temperamental but looks pretty cool from a display point of view. I like the concept of fantastic medieval war machines and it's great to see Lego developing these for the fantasy Castle theme. The only real niggle I have with this set is the lack of weapons. You get an iron sword for one of the Orcs and that's it really. The Orcish standard is built using an ornate spear but it'd be a shame to disassemble that as it looks really nice. And what about an axe for the Dwarf? Sure he's got a hulking big machine, but what happens when the Orcs creep up behind him?! It would've been great if they could have included a golden axe for the Dwarf like the ones seen in the Dwarves' mine set. This isn't too big a deal though and fortunately I have enough weapons to arm my Dwarf in a way that befits him! Overall this set is really great value. For £6.99 you get three great minifigures including a fantastic Dwarf and a great little war machine with some nice new parts. At that price how can you say no? Hope you enjoyed my review!"

I agree that the rubberband mechanism is weak, but I've found that to be pretty universal when Lego tries to use rubber bands to turn things. For wings and catapults and spring mecanisms they are great, but on wheels they are too slick to work perfectly. I think the lack of weapons is a bit sad as well. Even one more sword and a single headed axe for the dwarf would've been perfect."

It not only doesn't function very well, but also just looks bad. Why would the earthy brown and gray machine randomly have a bright blue band and red piece on the side of it? The intended function could have been achieved with a pair of small gears - and I think it would've looked better, too. This set is nice otherwise, but it's perfect if you're willing to make some slight modification."

Today I bring you a review of the homing spider droid. The box may say limited edition, but availability is no problem here. 1). Box Simple clean and impressive, good job TLC. 2). contents 3 bags and a small manual, NO STICKERS ! and little wasted space in the box 3). Minifigs *B1 battle droid *OOM command battle droid *B2 super battle droid *Clone trooper in Phase I armor *Commander Fox (I this fig!) 3a). Commander Fox He deserves his own section. 4). Build: OG-9 homing spider droid This build should take you at a maximum: 15 minutes. It is that fast. By the end of the the first two pages you get this: You bulk it up next two pages Then it looks like battle carnage. And build a second pair of legs. After that you build and attach this laser (now it looks like one) The second to last part is building the legs: starting at the feet. And then add the legs. When added this thing becomes a real monstrosity. You finally end with the lower laser cannon: starting with the attachment system. And attaching it... Then finish with building and attaching the lower laser. 5). Spares lots of clone trooper gear. good to deck out the other one. 6). Final thoughts. As one can tell from here, this thing dwarfs minifigs. Can Fox stand up to it's might? *squish* Nope, gues not... This set is well worth it and easy to get. Do it! Do it NOUGH!

I picked one of these up on Monday, so I have just a few thoughts to add. The entire droid was fairly wobbly, in my opinion. I've already exchanged the 16 blay Technic Pins with 16 black Pins with Friction. The legs end up MUCH more posable. I highly suggest this mod for anyone that buys this set. Black pins with friction are one of the most common extra pieces, so chances are most of you have enough spares lying around. The Clones are rather nice. Commander Fox looks especially good. I'm hoping a Phase I clone battle pack, or else Fox (and the other commanders) are going to have squads of one. Those four 1 x 2 Plates with Handle are not spares. They go on the feet, opposite the other four 1 x 2 Plates with Handle. Did you leave them off for aestheetics, or just miss the step? Just curious. Edited by Walter Kovacs, 30 July 2008 - 05:06 PM."

If you have a black technic pin, and it has slots in it, it's a pin with friction. I'm not sure when they started doing this, but I'd guess at least 8 years, give or take a few. Any Gray pins that you get in recent sets will be frictionless. LEGO generally puts the black pins in sets unless there's a reason for having the frictionless pins."

And the gunship will give air support. Plus, they'll have a hero... Asajj Ventress... to support them. That's 4 battle droids, 1 super battle droid and Asajj Ventress, plus the AAT and Droid BP for next year will add lots more troops. The clones will have the LAAT, the Republic Fighter Tank, and the Shuttle next year. Might skip the battle pack, depending. That's a lot of clones including 2 commanders, loads and loads of Jedi, and a fitting ending to my love for Lego. Sorry bout that. I love Commander Fox though, he's pretty cool with the red armour. I think Cody's okay, as is Rex. But they both have bright colours, not the dark red Fox has. You know how cool it would be to have a Female Clone Commander? Yeah, that cool."

I got this set too, and I am quite happy with it, even though I still think it's overpriced. What I like least about this set: The HSD is kinda unstable on it's feet and is not as posable as I would like it to be, but at least it doesn't fall over. What I like best about this set: The fact that you get two spare new blasters and twisted droid arms with it (if you don't give one of the blasters to the droid commander that is, who shouldn't have one IMO)! This way, you can exchange the normal arms with megaphones on them of two of the BDs from your Droid BP with them! I can recommend this set - it's definately one of the best this year!

I bought this set last week and had some photos ready for a review too, but you beat me to it Here's my shot of the complete set: This is a wicked set, a bit overpriced, but still too cheap to miss and a limited edition too! The Homing Spider Droid model is really cool but similar to what many have said, it's a bit like a spider on rollerskates when you try to pose it! It felt like a bit of a learning curve trying to get him in the right position. The massive bonus comes in the form of Commander Fox and the clonetrooper. Fox is an awesome minifig, the designs on his armour are extremely detailed and look fantastic. The clonetrooper accessories are excellent too, with enought to share between several troopers (I used the additional acessories to turn the other clonetrooper into Commande Flux!). I think it's a dead cert they'll release these as a battlepack and I can't wait 'til they do. I took several close-up photos of Commander Fox with the various different combinations of the clone accessories. If anyone wants me to post the pictures let me know. I can post them here or in another thread."

Sidewalk Cafe, is not the regular coffee stop such as Starbucks or the grand Cafe Corner. It's supposed to be on the sidewalk beside your regular roads. Sidewalk cafe, does not offer coffee. It offers ice cream! Name: Sidewalk Cafe Theme: LEGO System / Town Year: 1994 Pieces: 43 Minifigs: 2 Price: USD$7.25 An image of a 6402, Sidewalk Cafe *Ding Ding* Hello! Sidewalk Cafe is the regular ice cream station that locates in beaches, selling cool tasty ice cream in a hot sunny day where you are able to see babes riding on bicycles and etc. This is a very nice simple set, that comes under the Paradisa theme where resorts, beach activities, enterainment comes in. Yes, this set is an excellent addition to any towns for a great ice cream stop in any junctions of your roads, parks, beaches. It can be anywhere in your town to sell ice cream where most citizens will defintely love to have a taste of it. Let's take a better look at them! The red bicycle on your left is a very good alternate transport other than motorcycle. Well, I look red bicycle and it looks very handy for a good outdoor ride in a bright sunny day. The ice cream man looks great in that tight fit wear of his. He certainly looks good in that outfit, especially with that moustache of his. I love the blue lines of his torsos. It really match very well with its blue cap. The hot lady on the right, is one of the best looking female town mini-figures. Her face looks very sweet especially with that sexy outfit. Personally, I love both mini-figures very much, and it's not an expensive set to own the both of them. Great way to expand more citizens in your town, especially increasing your female population in that era. *Can I have a cup of strawberry ice cream?* The set up of the Sidewalk Cafe is pretty simple. With a few pillars and foilage at the back, a small table and an ice cream counter for your customers to select the variety. I must admit that this set offer great expansion. I am sure it's not a common thing to see a ""cafe"" selling ice cream on the streets. Ice Cream Counter The front of the ice cream counter is made up of sticker. However, that sticker looks real nice. I am quite sure if the sticker is not there, it will not look obvious that it is selling ice cream. Upper view of the Ice Cream Counter There are so many flavours for them to choose from. Sizes can range from small cups to big cups. You can even do it via self service at the counter by pulling the lever. Interesting Parts These parts are very uncommon because it is pink! And for collectors or builders whom are interested in pink elements, these are very good accessories to complement with your buildings or sets. I believe that the most rare and unique parts is the ice cream flavoured tiles. These are not stickers. These are printed tiles and is only available in this Sidewalk Cafe. These tiles looks very nice and is the main attraction why these people wants to visit this outlet. Look at the four delicious flavours! Different views of Sidewalk Cafe Relax yourself, with a cup of ice cream! Summary review Playability: 8.5/10 (Directing your town citizens where the ice cream is, they are sure to enjoy a nice cup) Design: 8.5/10 (Simple design with a low number of bricks, yet able to demostrate great ice cream station) Price: 9.0/10 (An inexpensive set based on the 1994 pricing. It comes with 2 mini-figs. red bicycle and the rare printed ice cream tiles) Overall: 8.6/10 (Which town do not need a Sidewalk Cafe? I think this is a great add on to any town.) I gave it a ""5"" based on my Review Score Card. What about yours? Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. Comments and Critics are strongly welcomed.

I'm your host, ImperialShadows, my not-so-lovely assistant is Stauder Staudie, and conducting this fascinating review will be our special reporter, WhiteFang. Name: Quad Bike Theme: LEGO System / Town / City Year: 2008 Pieces: 33 Minifigs: 1 Price: USD$5.00 The featured set will be a 7736 Quad Bike, one of the smallest set in the CITY sub theme, Coast Guard. Please sit back and relax yourself, while we present to you a total new experience, with some actions. *Camera Rolls* Nice Work at the cleaners Staudie... Hey! How should I know it was bleach? Don't you ever read instructions? It's... It's... Coming right at me! Argh! You gotta love him for the things he does I think he is scared stiff Ye think he's ok? STAUDIE! Can you wake up? Our special guest is here. Quit messing around. Don't try and pulled that stunt again! You are in my way when I was making that fanastic stunt! *Interviewing process* This is a very cool little quad bike from the Coast Guards. We used it to patrol beach and coast, to make sure that everyone is safe. This quad bike is easy to navigate and is small to handle, especially in cutting corners. The blue flag represent us, Coast Guard protecter. We will reach at the scene at a lightning speed. Let me show you the seat. Does this thing have keys? Actually It doesnt even have a tachometer... Let me try it out and I will let you know how fast it will really go. Next, let me show you the key componets of my quad bike. It's a very simple design. What I love most about my bike is its unique orange mudguard on the front and back. Where the heck did Staudie go? There he is... Run Li'll Vermin! RUN! Ahhhhhhh!!! Help me! We hardly knew thee... That's all, everyone. I really hope you loved this interactive review brought to you by EB News Review. Overall, we felt that this set is best considered as a impulse set. A very good way to acquire more coast guards with helmet and visor. Therefore, we recommend to get it since it's not very dear (expensive, for you Americans). Thanks for joining, hope to see you again soon with another EB News Review! *Camera Fades*"

This was an impulse buy for me the first day Coast Guard appeared on the shelves. I agree, it's a nice way to collect Coast Guard minifigs.

Inspired by White Fang and our famous news crews' Interview Review of Coast Guard Quad Bike 7736, this review is a challenge between two other fantastic 4-wheelers. Vote for your favorite quad (leaving the Dino Attack dinosaur in the dust). Some images of the boxes of both sets: Beach Patrol 35 Pieces - Released 2004 - $4 (USD) Dino Sprinter 42 Pieces - Released 2005 - $4 (USD) The Dune Patrol has a ""Classic Town"" look with it's bright yellow pieces and ""beach'n"" orange fig. A stark contrast to the darker crimson and tan Dino Sprinter with Post Apoc-style fig: The Dino Sprinter quickly takes the aggresive lead: But wait, the sand-covered Beach Patrol is able to get in front of the Dino Sprinter, but ""Digger"" has something that may even the score: It worked! But the Dino Sprinter is first to see a small ""blip"" with his blue-radar gun. It's a dinosaur in World City! The Dino Sprinter jumps ahead: OUCH! There's a BUDP in the road - Big Ugly Dinosaur Piece. Both quads and LUDP - Little Ugly Dinosaur Piece escape quickly! You decide which Quad Set is the better of the two. Here's a shot of Digger and the Dune Patrol Driver: And their two great quads: Hope you vote for your favorite Quad and enjoy this review. WARNING! Beware of Mutant Lizard Dinosaurs, both BIG and SMALL."

I was like laughing away at my computer right now. It's a hard choice for me to decide. Both quad bikes are really very nice since I don't own any of them. Taking into consideration of what I can do with these vehicles. The Dune patrol is an excellent addition to support the Coast Guards. While the Sprinter could be used as a recce jeep for military operation. Both sets really have their plus points. After some serious thought, I will go for the Sprinter as it featured a sub millitary platoon that can be used to do conventional operations. Furthermore, I don't have such vehicle types in my Town. My existing Coast Guard quad bike is in my collection now and I am not sure if it will be able to compliment with it. Therefore, this is where I cast my vote."

First of all, the Quad doesn't work with the other Coast Guard/World City sets. While the main base (which I got and actually enjoyed very much) was grey, this quad is bley. I tried and it just doesn't look good. Secondly, considering that Dino Attack is a sort of overrated theme despite having big-megablocks dinosaurs romping around and killing things... and Coast Guard is a sort of underrated theme despite being stuck in LEGO's lamest year... well problems with Dino Attack aside, Dinosaurs win over Life Jackets. So I'm in for the Sprinter."

Anyway, I love the look of both sets, but i'll have to go for the Dino Attack Quad for a couple of reasons: It is post-apoc, which I love, features tan and dark red colours which are far more useful than yellow, you get more ""bang for your buck"" with the Dino set, you get a little dino (sure you can hate it but better than not having one right?), and the fig has much more useful pieces and a better face.

There are many reasons for that, most of which have been mentioned by others already: I hate yellow, it's the most useless color, but I love tan and dark red. It's bigger and more detailed than the Coast guard one. Plus, I think there is a hinge in the back of it, so there is apparently some more playability to it as well. I love the post-apoc style fig! It's detailed and simply looks cool! Also, while the Digger fig has quite an individual look to it, the Coast Guard driver has the generic hero head and Coast Guard uniform. It's an overal better deal, especially if you count the LUDP which gives the set a whole lot more playability, no matter how U the LDP may be. Tan & post-apoc figs ON!"

It is getting dark here right now, so some of the pictures are a bit dark. 1) Minifigs: The set comes with two of the new Clone Wars clone troopers, which in my opinion are pretty cool. It also comes with two short blasters and a bag of clone accessories. Figs with helmets: Figs without helmets: 2) The tank: This thing is HUGE (25cm long and 22cm wide), and far oversized in my opinion, but looks great nonetheless. I very much like the white and dark red color scheme, mixed with a bit of lime green (even though there is no lime green bricks ;) ). Left side: Right side: Back side: Both of the wings contain a hidden compartment to store the blasters and a part that rotates to reveal three flickfire missiles. The front opens up as well to reveal the engine. The side guns and the gun on the top rotate. Inside the cockpit is space for two figs; one seated in front of two computer screens and one placed in a moveable seat, which moves up and down, allowing the fig to pop up the top hatch and staying hidden while the hatch is closed. This function is triggered by opening the backdoor. Hidden compartment and missiles: Engine: Top hatch (open/closed): Interior: 3) Rating: Build: 9/10 Not much to say here. Minifigs: 7/10 An extra fig or two would have been great; eventually a Jedi or a commando. Design: 8/10 This only looses a couple of points for being oversized, but it’s a great looking model. Parts: 10/10 At 592 parts, this is one of the CW sets with the best parts/price ratio. Price: 8/10 Sure this thing is great, but I think its overpriced at 569 kr. (approx. $120). When build it feels more like a 450 kr. Set. Final verdict: 9/10 Despite some flaws this thing is definitely recommended, and it looks great on your shelf, too ;)"

I have been waiting for this moment for someone to do up an excellent review like this. Republic Fighter Tank is my 2nd favourite set, in my Clone Wars list. The 2 Clone Troopers could be easily add up to your RGS, since it offer only more trooper. However, I felt that this set is quite overpriced. In fact, all Clone War sets are very expensive. The Fighter Tank, has a very great color combination of red and white to represent the Republic. The wheels below is the most impressive feature, which enable the hovering feel. The hatch is a neat feature as well. However, I noticed there is a rubber band within the control panel. May I know what is it for? I really enjoy viewing this review. You had given the insight which will eventually determined whether to get it any sooner or later. pr0visorak, on Aug 2 2008, 05:35 PM, said: This set costs a S$100 in singapore.I went to Hng Kong too see lego and the shops there are more expensive by a few dollars.However,I went to Australia before and everything there is the same price but when there is a sale it becomes very cheap! Hello pr0visorak. You are from Singapore as well. Welcome to Eurobricks! I hope you will do an introduction to the rest of the members in this forum.

Here go's... 1. Manual Not much here although it's an old style manual cover. Random shot. Back. 2. General set and minifigs A pic of the entire set, it has 2 reddish tan Battle Droids Geo pilot, Geo soldier, Geo Star Fighter and Geo turret. The 4 figs, the droids come with backpacks. Geo soldier. I prefer this gun. Give him a cane to become Poggle the Lesser the Geo leader. Detailed legs are always nice. The bodies are a little fat for Geonosians I guess but nice printing on them. The head. The wings. 1. 2. 3. Voila! All done 3. The Star Fighter It has a landing gear type thing. The detail on those plates. The pilot in the cockpit. Cockpit with canopy. 1 of 2 ball joint things, this is the engine. 2nd ball joint which is the front gun. 4. The turret The turret by itself. Turret with the soldier. A printed round plate. 5. Overall Build: 7/10 A little repetitive but enjoyable. Minifigs: 9/10 4 that's pretty good for a set this size. Design: 6/10 The fighter dosen't really look right nor does the turret but they are both strong. Parts: 8/10 Lot's of interesting parts and comes with two of the ball joint things as well the minifig parts being good. Price: 10/10 Cheap (for the UK) considering the amount of minifigs and parts. Playability: 5/10 not much but you can have mini battles with the turret and starfighter. Overall: 8/10 I gave it 8 because of the design which was not accurate and the low number of parts.

Not so affordable now because of the cool figs but i'm going to have a look on eBay and bricklink right now just in case! An army of tan red droids would look great. Maybe we'll see some if Geonosia appears in the new seires somehow unlikely since the Confederacy was defeated at the Battle of Geonosis. I wish I could have bought this set when it came out but i'd just left university so I was super skint and had to miss all the Ep.II sets now they all cost loads even in used condition. At least now there has been a re-design of the gunship and AT-TE from the Clone Wars series that I can buy.

This set came out about the same time as the ROTS sets and included the first minifig to have a LUL. 1. Box & Manual This is the front of the box, it has a try me slot for the LUL Vader. A close up of the try me slot. Luckily I got mine form Argos so no little kids have been playing around with it. The manual cover. I'm not quite sure why it has a pic of the figs on the front but it doesn't deface it so I don't mind. Random manual shot. ROTS set preview at the back of the manual. 2. General set and figs The contents of the set. # The minifigs. A normal TIE pilot and the first ever LUL fig DV. (Also my only LUL fig) No helmets. TIE Pilot torso. The LUL is made of 3 parts. Lighted up. The LED for the blade. 3. The TIE Fighter Just a pic of it. Cockpit with controls. TIE pilot sitting in the cockpit. By the way the hinge brick is the wrong color it is supposed to be grey. The cockpit shut. I wonder why TLC never printed those cockpit glass things correctly. Jet out the back. Top plate has some nice printing. 5. Overall Build: 5/10 very repetitive...well the ships symmetrical! Minifigs: 4/10 1 TIE pilot which is okay but a LUL Vader he can't even fit in the ship. Design: 6/10 strong but the wings are all wobbly if that makes sense. I don't like the blue either. Parts: 6/10 Lots of blue grills thingy's not much else but it got 6 because of the wings plates. Price: 5/10 Could have been more expensive. At least it had 2 figs. Playability: 1/10 Can't do much as a stand alone set. Overall: 4/10 There just isn't enough here. It could at least have a better color scheme and instead of DV it could come with a Stormie like the old one did."

When I saw 8147 bullet run on S@H for half the price I couldn´t resist buying it. We had a lot of fun celebrating a bag-build at our event using the 8150 ZX Turbo of that theme so I knew what would expect me with this ""extended"" set. Price: normal 49,99€ now 24,99€ (well I paid 34,99€ in a Lego store but that´s another story...) Bricks: 796 Minifigs: - Hey, this is tiny turbos, stupid! Stickers: Don´t ask (or read further) The open box reveals seven polybags, some with more smaller polybags inside, the instruction booklet, 2 ramps and the sticker sheet. Of course I put all of the bags on the table and not on the floor Hey, TLC didn´t print this on the first page of the building instructions! And you won´t see any piece callouts as well. On the other hand this is not adifficult build, so why show them? Still there is an inventory list of all bricks at the end of the instructions. Note the giant sticker sheet! We all now the DSS, but that is a new kind of extra super large sticker sheet. It holds 82 stickers! More to that later on. The build is quite basic. The only non-conventional parts of the build were the two slammers. And the most annoying part was fiddling the rubber band of the holder without destroying it. Bag 1: Easy beginning: Building the lime car, the limo and the two slammers. Nothing exciting about the lime car, but the limo was neat. It´s an 18 studs long car! The normal racers are abot 10 studs long. Nice way to put the horns on the back! The slammers. Mmmmh. Nice invention if they would actually DO something. They are supposed to give the Tubros a kick in the butt to speed them up, but the result is a 80 cm long ""run"" and that´s it. I had expected more acceleration from the slammers. But it´s also fun to play with the cars without slamming them. Bag 2: Convoy time: The tow truck and the fuel truck The tow truck is a great idea and a good addition to the set. The cars are supposed to crash - how do they get back home? Well, here´s the answer. Quite american layout of the truck and it´s very well done: Horns, 5 flashing lights and a right color choice. You can move the arm up and down and pull out the hook. Note the metallic silver antennae. The fuel tank has got a ""secret"" function. It may break on the middle of the trailer. Therefore it has a hinge build in the bottom. City fire mayhem! And there´s no fire engine... Bag 3: Long, longer, how long can a ""tiny"" truck be? The pipe truck, an unexpected buggy and the red racer. 36+ studs long: The pipe truck breaks every convention. The cabin is almost the same like the tow truck and the fuel truck and that is the good part of it. The trailer has to carry pipes and is functional as well as it can commute sidewarts. It looks quite unrealistic as well and you cannot drive this beast on tiny roads. Good for another crash. But there are more cars in this bag. Now this was a surprise: A buggy? This is the only 6(+)-wide car, but just because the wheels are large. Monster truck madness? I don´t care for those cars. Personally a disappointment, I would have preferred another racer. + for variety though. Did I say another racer? Here we are: The red devil. Great looking, a real fast shape and red. The best racer in this set. Vrooommm! This is the most ""played with"" car of the set. (Not only from me ). As you may have noticed I didn´t put any stickers so far. I don´t like stickers especially when placed over two or more bricks! And here you are supposed to do it several times. Of course the cars look better with stickers on, but they are also great without stickers. Only the fuel truck looks boring without. My sons didn´t know there were supposed to be stickers and they didn´t ask for them. So everything is allright! Here´s a closeup of the sticker sheet (did I already mention it was 82 stickers? ): The only exception I made using sticker was for bag 4: Bag 4: You go here? You pay! The highway toll booth. The only immobile part of the set, but great to brake though the barriers. That is fun! I only put on stickers on 2x2 plates where I had the idea to use those plates further on on different other MOCs. This looks a bit boring without the other stickers I admit. But still no cut off to the playability! There are also two ramps belonging to the set. These only make sense if you are able to speed up the racers with the slammers and hit the ramps correctly. I had problems with that, so they are on the shelves now... Could be a lot fun making a contest though. Like this (picture of the inventories frontpage) All cars put together: The usual leftovers: All in all this is a great set to call ones own! I did not regret buying it, especially when it was 50% off! Even normal price would not have been too much. Build: Great for smaller children, boring to AFOLs: 5/10 Special bricks/colors: None, all basics: 3/10 Design: I love the tiny turbos´ size and design: 9/10 Playability: -1 because of the slammers, another -1 because no minifig-scale. But that is not the intention of the set: still 9/10 Price/piece ratio: Dang! It´s not on sale any more. But if you hurry you could still grab one in the Lego stores. 10/10 All in all: 8.5/10 and a clear recommendation! It was and still is a set to play with your children. The size fits perfectly to Matchbox cars and that was exactly what my younger son did: Can you find all of the cars included in the set? P.S.: After buying this set I won an ebay auction with another tiny turbos set - 8135 bridge chase. This is even more fun! I will soon care for a review with some never seen photo-tricks as well. Stay tuned! Edited by WhiteFang, 23 May 2009 - 07:02 PM. Indexed"

The racers are great. The trucks and the limo are the best in my oppinion. The sticker sheet is huge, but I've seen bigger. Stickers over multiple pieces are the worst The slammers are ok, but not great. I played with my 4 years old son and we tryed to do what shows in the box (the cars passing the toll, jumping the ramps and crashing the trucks) but it is very difficult to get it right. But the crashes are very fun."

I crossed the German border and bought me this one mainly for the parts. To get time going, I built the models and made this small review for you to enjoy (or hate) High resolution pics can be found here when public. Set# 4994 Title: Fierce Creatures Price: 9.99 EURO / 12.99 USD Pieces: 193 Minifigs: 0 The Box: The box looks awesome! It has some great animations of the 3 models in the instruction. The rear of the box shows some nice up-close-and-personal drawings of each model. I think it works better having the models drawn instead of a mere photo of them. Somehow it allows the great colour-scheme to really show. The Instructions: The instruction is easy to follow and shows which pieces are used in each building step. That makes it all a lot easier, especially with so many small pieces as in this set. The bricks are divided into 3 polybags and the instruction is a fine small book, which can be easily stored along the rest of your ever-growing amount of booklets and pamphlets printed by TLG. The models: Model 1 is a spider and it’s nasty. The 2x2 modified brick with the hole would allow one to hang it from a string. This beast is sure to give you several nightmares, were it hanging from a string in your bedroom. – So I wouldn’t do that (plus the fact that my wife threw away the box and ordered me to take the spider apart when she saw it – She’s an arachnophobian and does not take spiders lightly). It looks real, in a brickish-non-real-way. Model 2 is a snake. There’s not much to say other than the head is awesomely designed and the rest is bad. The body is poorly designed and does not live up to the coolness of the head. Build the head, ignore the rest. Model 3 is a flying scorpion or something. Not as realistic as the spider, but still a great model with a cool head. The tail is a bit poorly designed, but it’ll do and it does offer some good ideas on how to use bricks. All in All Verdicts: This is an ok Creator set. It holds a lot of fine pieces and the models are an ok inspiration. Given its size, it’s an ok set. But it’s nothing more than that. I’ll give it an average score. I enjoyed building the models and fumbling with the bricks in the shade during a “siesta” on my vacation. And that’s what it is, an enjoyable build and a little inspiration on a hot day with a Erdinger Dunkel Weissbier in my other hand. KimT Edited by WhiteFang, 23 May 2009 - 06:29 PM. Indexed"

This is the original trilogy edition version of this set but there aren't any differences to the normal one. 1. Manual & Box The front of the OTE box The minifgs on the box top. The back of the box with some alternate models and overview of some of the functions. The manual cover. You can see it is the OTE version of the set. Random shot. 1 of 2 posters in the instructions. The second poster. 2. General set and minifigs The built set contents. The three figs with the included weapons. How I like to customize the pilots helmets. Luke from 4500 and Luke from 10178 Motorized AT-AT. The three helmets included with the set. 3. Turret Here's the turret with the Rebel gunner standing next to it. The controls for the turret . The turret can rotate and tilt two fire at those pesky AT-AT walkers. I put a spider web sort of radar dish thing on like on the original 7130 to make it look more like the one from TESB. 4. The Speeder A front view of the speeder. The pilot controls with a AT-AT print. The seats for the pilot and rear gunner. The rear gunner's tow cable. A detailed printed plate next to the engines. Printed plates under the air-brake things. More printed parts, there is no DSS with this set. Got tie up those walkers. We might need some more tow cable . 5. Overall Build: 7/10 Pretty symmetrical build but it's fun. Minifigs: 8/10 3 figs in a £20 set is pretty good I think. Design: 9/10 Very strong and close to minifig scale. The turret could have some work though. Parts: 8/10 lot's of variety and includes some interesting ones such as the cockpit and rear air vent. Price: 7/10 3 figs and 214 parts not to bad I guess. Playability: 6/10 Could be better if it came with a Snow Trooper. Overall: 8/10 The set comes with 3 figs that only come with more expensive sets, also it has a variety of different parts as well as the build being enjoyable.

It's one of the sets that sent my into a dark age (the birth of my son contributed heavily). When I first saw this set I was convinced that the earlier Snowspeeder (7130) was superior in every way. I liked the look of the 7130 version better, I liked the coloration of it better. The turret was better (it used a webbed 6 x 6 dish). After seeing this review, I realize I was wrong on some accounts. The cockpit is much more movie accurate. The 7130 version had two separate compartments. This version also came with a tow cable, something that was lacking from the previous set. While I still am unimpressed with the overall look of this set, it is much less blocky, which is always a good thing. Overall, I still prefer 7130 to the 4500 version. But the 4500 isn't nearly as bad as I first assumed, and I regret never buying one of these when I had my chance."

I bought this set when it came out but sold it a couple years later for some extra cash. I have no regrets selling this one, as I was never really impressed with it (different story for the 4483 AT-AT - oh how I wish I still had that one). The snowspeeder was alright, just didn't have any sort of ""wow"" factor to it. The best part of the set is probably the Rebel Trooper. Looking at the last photo in your review, looks like you're about to have a major battle in your hallway. Apart from the snowspeeder & motorized AT-AT, I see the ARC-170 Fighter, Grievous's starfighter, and is that a podracer I see -- and what is the set with the treads? It's not Star Wars, but looks like a pretty cool set (maybe a Mission Mars vehicle)."

General set and Minifigs (not manual because I don't have it) The contents of the box after being built. Both minifigs. The set includes 5 Lightsabers! My own design GG. GG's cape on the outside. GG's cape on the inside. 2. The Wheel bike Front view standing on legs. Side view. GG can't hold the controls because of his arms. Roller mode. The legs are a bit to chunky so to roll it has to be tilted forward. 3. Boga The lizard. Grey tip to the tail. The front back and saddle split in to three sections. 4. Overall Build: 4/10 There isn't really much to build. Minifigs: 9/10 It comes with GG with the special cape and Obi-Wan in ROTS gear which is hard to find I think. Design: 5/10 Not really to scale but otherwise okay apart from Boga which just looks like any old dinosaur. Also the controls on the Wheel bike aren't really right. Parts: 6/10 Comes with some Dark Green bricks and lots of rods ( the guns on the wheel bike) the Boga feet are also nice. Price: 8/10 £10 for 2 figs isn't bad it could have a few more parts though. Playability: 10/10 You can easily recreate the movie scenes with this set. Overall 7/10 It would be better if the bike and Boga were more to scale and more accurate as well as the set having more parts.

Looking at this page you can that this set has numbered bags. Back cover. Look how old Yodas computer looks . 2. General set and Minifigs The sets contents. Jango With his hair on. Jango with helmet on with front view of face. Twist Jango's head to initiate super bounty hunter mode. Jango's doubled sided head. Boba. Nothing to special although I think the torso and head are exclusive to the set. 3. The Ship Not really scaled up right as you can see. The guns can rotate. The central sections interior. Not sure what this is. Is it a hyperdrive or a bomb or something? There are these side panels on both sides. Behind the panels. A secret compartment. Trans orange minifig heads in the compartment. I think they're supposed to be saturnic charges. Side storage compartment. The back of the ship. How those trans orange minifig heads fallout. There is a magnet on the inside of the ship. But for what... The secret prison which also has a magnet on the top so it can stay on but easily come out. The doors on it can lift up to put prisoners inside. 1 of 2 identical wing things. They can fold for flight mode. The controls. Bottom jet thing. LET ME OUT OF HERE! The prison is great for capturing small children. 4. Overall Build: 7/10 Impossible to build without a hard stable surface. Minifigs: 10/10 2 Exclusive figs. Design: 7/10 Nowhere near to scale but has some nice features. Parts: 8/10 Good parts like that big cockpit canopy. Price: 9/10 For the price I got it was pretty good especially with the figs it comes with.

My version of the set comes with a normal Mace Windu figure and an extra clone trooper. Also the Mace Windu, BARC trooper and jet trooper minifigs were exclusive to the set (Well you could make the jet trooper yourself) . Also my set came with 4 extra blasters (you'll see them later) and Baby blue vent things instead of trans blue. 1.Manual & Box The front of the box. The box compared to the motorized AT-AT and the hailfire droid and dwarf spider droid. Minifgs. The back which has pics of the sets functions and alternate models. Inside the box it has a white cardboard divider probably for strength seeming as the box it so flimsy. Pretty hefty manual. The TT manual compared to the one of the AT-AT ones. Random shot. Another random shot. Poster at the back of the manual 2. General set and minifigs The whole set. I accidentally left one of the plates up when I took the pic. Close up of the figs. Two battle droids come with blasters and a mini turret. The republic. From L-R: Jet Trooper, Mace Windu (not LUL), BARC Trooper, Normal Clone, The Commander, Look out. Jet pack. Mace's torso. BARC trooper legs. BARC trooper torso. He has got to be my favorite clone trooper by TLC. The mysterious commander. On LSW he was called Cody (right) but he has star corps Armour making him commander Bly (left) . Normal Clone and the look out Clone with electro binoculars. 3. Speeder Bike Side view of the BARC Speeder. Menacingish front view. (is menasingish a word?) Printed back engine piece. One of my shield things came with a crumpled handle it is worse than it looks in the pic. 4. The turret The turret. It can rotate and point upwards. But what if you want to blast all those Battle droids that are shorter than the height of the turret blasters... add another hinge in! That extra hinge in action. 5. The Tank It's to big to get a decent side view pic Johnny the cabin boy on the crows nest. Front 2 seater cockpit. The 2 seats. Better be careful you don't fall off your seat there are some pretty big gaps down the sides. Back cockpit with dual missile launchers. The back seat. The engine. The large central storage. The turret controls fold down to lock into place so it doesn't fall out when driving. You can put 2 minifigs up top. Mace and a Clone driving. you can see those 4 extra blasters, 2 orange at the front of the pic and 2 between the chairs. The turret and jet trooper. BARC trooper on the BARC speeder. The commander on the lift chair in the back cockpit. Another shot of that chair. 6. Overall Build: 8/10 Quite enjoyable because it incorporates Technic and system parts. Minifigs: 9/10 On a set this size it has quite a lot including some exclusives such as the BARC trooper but it could of had a droid or 2 more. Design: 7/10 way out of scale but generally pretty strong due to the technic frame. Parts: 7/10 Lots of plates and nice minifig parts. Price: 6/10 Justifiable because of the amount of figs in the set. Playability: 7/10 Includes some CIS units to fight the clones. Overall:8/10 Needs more droids and it could be bigger. I will also probably have a break form reviewing for now seeming as I have just put out a whole load of reviews. Edited by KimT, 09 August 2008 - 08:51 PM. indexed as 7261 Review 2"

It's completely useless, we can't use any part of it for anything (although, I only discovered yesterday that the lightsaber blade was a standard one and not glued, as I always believed, so all isn't completely lost) In the end I still was rather disappointed by the set.

This small one fell into my lap very cheap. With box and minifigs in great condition. So now I've resized the pics and done the review. And NO I am NOT envious of this forum...really...I'm not.... The Box. The box is pretty neat. It has a very comfortable size (compared to modern boxes) and the back of it shows what you get. I like the way they (TLG) split the minifigs and arranged everything neatly. Front: Rear Sadly the box has seen better days. But it's age taken into consideration, I think it's just fine. The figs: A fine collection of red, white and yellow space figs. Some great accesories to go as well. Not much more to say, except this was a great ""army-builder""-set. A true must have for most Classic Space fans. The verdict: It's kinda hard rating this set, since it's a minifig supplemental set. No design or colourscheme to comment on. It has a lot of playability since figs will always come in handy when building/playing with your Space sets. KimT"

I skipped all of the classic minifig sets, space, castle and town. It was only upon coming out of my dark ages that I went minifig crazy. For me, this is above average because of the accessories. Without them, it's an average set. With a small brick built droid or a rover, it would be outstanding. That said, I'd buy at least 10 copies now, though I'd rather have a 4 figure set with one of each colour including blue. I never had blue back then. I think Castle lured me away.

It first appeared in the Genndy Tartakovsky?€™s Clone wars 2D series. Basics Box front: The box art shows the torrent flying above Tatooine, with the new blue and white ?€œclone wars?€? style packaging, Box back: The back shows some of the features of the set including the lifting mechanism and adverts for 7679 Republic Gunship, 7675 AT-TE and the 7673 MagnaGuard starfighter Inside the box, there are 2 instruction books, a very small DSS and 9 bags that are not numbered. Bags: Instruction books Random manual shot Parts list Book one is mainly the construction of the body and one of the engines, Book 2 is the other engine and the wings. For better pics of the manual look on lego's website. Sticker sheet: A very small sticker sheet is included, which includes 2 republic insignias and a nose sticker. Minifigure One minifigure is included, a clone pilot. The whole ""OMG only one minifigure in this set"" and ""Its not movie accurate, i hate you TLC!!!11one2"" has been beaten to death, so please don't make this review turn into that and to be honest i don't care because its an awesome figure. TLC have made the effort to print the life support device onto the chest plate so props to them. He has the ""clone head"" like the rest of the clones have in the CW releases, there are no extra clone bits apart from a long blaster, that's not included here. Interesting/other pieces Printed piece! Rare/unusual pieces: there are 2 pistons included, as well as 2 weird looking technic pieces that serve as the landing gear during the build. which might explain why the set is quite expensive, it musn't have been cheap to manufacture them. The build It starts off relatively simple, the first 16 steps is getting the basic shape of the cockpit and the mechanism to make the middle wing move up and down. After that the next few steps are getting the landing gear/wing folding device done, it's actually the same thing so when the wings move into attack mode the landing gear retracts. This is then locked into place by the white beams that form the basic shape of the fuselage. Up to step 46 is the fuselage, as well as fitting the hydraulics. This is what it looks like when the fuselage is complete. The cockpit is not ""air tight"", there's is quite a big gap Top: Bottom: The final few steps of book 1 is the construction of one of the engines, here it is attatched : The yellow bar is not permanent, its used to keep the white bit at the top from moving downwards. The steps are repeated in the second book so that both engines are now in On to the wings! First one attatched, The middle one is attached now: and finally the last one: It is now finished! The pieces that are left: So, you're probably wondering, how does it enter attack mode? well can you see this bar? push that bar to the center, and pick it up, the hydraulics move the central wing downwards as well as the side wings to enter attack mode: The outer wings have flickfire missiles on them, they obviously don't work, but it increases the playability of the set. The cockpit opens in a similar way to General Grevious's starfighter released last year, using a sliding mechanism For other pics see here : http://s25.photobuck...eview/?start=20 and i'll be taking other requests for pics, maybe a video of it switching between modes. Build: 7/10 very symmetrical build, the mechanism to move the wings might annoy some people. Minifigs: 5/10 1 fig in a £50 set, however it is a starfighter Design: 9/10 very accurate to the source material, Lego have really made the effort to make the movement feature work. Parts: 8/10 lots of technic, white and dark red pieces Price: 7/10 could be slightly cheaper, Playability: 6.5/10 need to buy some enemy sets to get the most of it, flick fires don't work. comments, requests, questions and criticisms welcome.

This just re-affirms that the V-19 is my highest priority this fall. Behind the RGS, of course. Is that new printed piece a 2 x 2 Tile? It looks like an excellent detail part for MOCing. Those black pieces used on the landing gear look very Bionicle-like. If they haven't been used before, I'd suspect they will be. Not that I'm a Bionicle expert or anything. It is a shame that this set only includes one clone. That seems to be the only drawback to the set. Everything else looks spot on."

I'm interested in what you think of the hydrolics. I could spend hours just deploying and undeploying the wings and landing gear. I'm a little worried, the very first batch of the hydrolic piece for, umm, I think it was the off-road 4x4 Technic set, was very fragile and broke after a few uses. These seem to be holding up but I'm anxious to see if they hold up after 100-200 uses. quote name='Walter Kovacs' date='Aug 4 2008, 11:47 AM' post='337841'] Those black pieces used on the landing gear look very Bionicle-like. If they haven't been used before, I'd suspect they will be. Not that I'm a Bionicle expert or anything. [/quote] Right you are. They are Bionicle Bohrok head pieces. So pretty old in Bionicle terms and fairly useless in my opinion but they do make interesting looking landing gear as I deploy and redeploy the wings and landing gear. Hopefully, we'll get a pilot in the battle pack to help mitigate the fact we only get one here. -Tohst"

The V-19 has been one of my favourite ships since the release of CWA and this is one of the sets I've been considering most about buying. It's great to see TLG's treatment of it. It looks like no expense was spared making it as aesthetically and functionally accurate as possible - though I think the cockpit windshield could maybe have been slightly bigger, but that's just me I'm sure. It looks pretty big compared to other starfighters too. Did it take a long time to build?"

I put together my V19 Torrent last night, and I was surprised by how heavy the completed ship is. It has some real heft. Once it's finished, WOW! it is a really cool ship. I was disappointed that the central wing doesn't really lock into place once it flips down. It just kind of droops there, so I attached a technic pin to the locking arm so it could plug into the 2x4 brick that's on the underside of the starfighter (this brick can be seen in your photo of the bottom of the ship). Overall, the build is one of the more confusing that I've seen (I had to dismantle and re-build the first engine after I realized I'd left out a piece) and I kept thinking of the poor 7-year-old that gets this set as his/her very first LEGO set ever."

Before we start I'd like to thank Greenhair for selling me one of his metroliners for a mere 80 euros. Granted, the motor, ""trainstation"" and tracks weren't included but I did get an extra railcar instead. - * (please note that I have included the fourth wagon in the final pic but that the official set includes just three wagons.) The metroliner was released in 1992 and was extremely popular amongst lego fans. The set A picture of the box showing the set completely. (pic taken from peeron) and one of the minifigs and the accessories.: As you may notice, TLC was extremely generous, supplying us with a grand total of 11 minifgs amongst which no less than 4 female minifigs. Ah, the population crisis is finally over We also have three suitcases, three cups and a small freight parcel and freight handling thingy. Normally this would include two bicycles; a red and a black one. A general side view of the three carriages. (thanks to Greenhair and the Brickster) And here's one of the extra carriage. (thanks to Greenhair and the Brickster) Moving onto the front and back carriage, which are externally identical. Please note that Greenhair changed my back carriage's headlights. These would be yellow in the normal set. All the doors in the entire set are printed pieces. (sorry for the bad picture quality in this one) The interior of the two however is laid out a bit differently. The space in the front carriage is occupied by a cockpit (or whatever it is called in trains) and some space to store your cable connecting the front lights with the engine. I can imagine it must get quite cramped and dangerous for the minifig driver with all the cabling. Further back we have a quite random, weird looking engine. One part reminded me rather of a jet engine on a commercial airplane. The engine is accessible by means of the two side cargo doors. At the end of our first carriage we hit what looks like the train's restaurant, two tables and no chairs. The two middle carriages are identical, both have a small sink nicely hidden from the intervening and impolite looks of fellow passengers. The carriage further contains two tables and four seats. Two cargo spaces are nicely tucked away from view below the tables. Our final carriage has a back cockpit as well but differs from the front carriage in the central cargo area - where our train employee is hard at work earning his lego nickels - and the rear sleeping area. The bed is a double one, the upper one able to be flipped up for somewhat difficult access to the lower one. The train station I could not take photos off since it was not included in the purchase. Judging from the building plans however I feel it was thrown in at the end just to add 'something' to the set. Its construction is very simple, consisting of a few grey plates on top of a few pillars. Access is provided by a plate which is connected to the platform with a few hinges. There are however two lamp posts, a timetable and a few chairs so if you don't like the platform you can still use these parts in a variety of other constructios. To end off I took a pic of the complete set (with extra wagon) and a friendly surprised train driver opening the door and greeting the camera man. Conclusion Being a '90s set, the train basically builds itself. The entire build cost me two hours and a half (I lost quite some time simply admiring the set) and was extremely straightforward with no suprises at all, but I need to admit it has its charm. The exterior is simply amazing. The sleekness of the design, the colours, it matches perfectly! I believe however that a width of 8 studs would be more to scale but 6 wide still looks amazing. The interior is somewhat simplistic but is easily moddeable with a few extra pieces. I basically bought the train as a parts pack. The standard set (three wagons) includes no less than 8 train doors with windows, 14 train windows, 4 smaller longer ones and 4 freight doors. The front and back of course count as unique pieces as well. One feature I am displeased with are the printed doors. I like printed pieces and while the blue-white-red stripe looks beautiful on the side the printed doors kind of limit MOCing capabilities to carriages with a stripe on the side. I considered simply removing the stripe but I found out I could just get normal grey ones from bricklink for a fair price. I am very pleased with the train but since you already know my opinion, feel free to tell us yours of this fabulous set! Edited by TheBrickster, 09 July 2009 - 01:51 PM.

This set is definately a FIVE! Lego hasn't made a complete train SET like this in a long time. The Metroliner is really a legend among classic trains. The great level of playability and detailing makes it a terrific model. Specifically, I was just noticing the details of the passenger car. It has a sink! - How cool is that? And 11 minifigs - when was the last time Lego included 11 figs in a single set? A truly outstanding train set. Thanks for sharing images as I've always wanted to see it up-close.

The color scheme is the same one that Amtrak and many local subway systems use. I picked it up along with the club car expansion when they were re-released in 2001. I have made various modifications to mine, rearranging the car layouts and adding a second train motor into the rearmost car along with another set of lights, so that both ends light up. As you said, it would be great to have an 8-stud version of this, so you could fit in two rows of seats side by side. That might make a nice mod project at some point."

So about a year ago I started rebuilding it, and it now sits proudly next to (also rebuilt) 2150 on my shelf. IMO; It's an excellent set, best of the 9V passenger trains, no doubt. And it combines the best of the 80's trains with that of the 90's - it's not some futuristic panorama-glassed low-slung train, but an honest, realistic-looking train that captures many of the features that passenger trains used to (and in some cases; still) have."

The space in the front carriage is occupied by a cockpit (or whatever it is called in trains) and some space to store your cable connecting the front lights with the engine. I can imagine it must get quite cramped and dangerous for the minifig driver with all the cabling. Further back we have a quite random, weird looking engine. One part reminded me rather of a jet engine on a commercial airplane. The engine is accessible by means of the two side cargo doors. At the end of our first carriage we hit what looks like the train's restaurant, two tables and no chairs. There shouldn't be so much of the light cable in the front section or ""cockpit."" Most of the cable should be in the central part of the train. Then it is not so crowded for the engine driver. I have never had a problem with the cable and the space available for it. The only problem I had was that the cable had a loose contact after some time. When the train went into a curve (can't remember if it was a left or right curve) the light went off. I have now got the same problem with the cable that I put into my Santa Fe Super Chief. Always when the engine turns into a right curve, the light goes off. My dad could repair the cable for the metroliner. Even though he is quite skilled at repairing electronic things, he found it very difficult to repair since there were no screws to open the electronic plate. It annoyed him a lot. So I've been asking myself if I should really bother him with a second cable with the same problem. The train set itself is outstanding (and that's what I voted for). I only have the legend 10001, but it's 99% identical to 4558. I also have club car 4547. I don't have the legend club car 10002. The reason for this is I always had the choice between one big LEGO set or several small ones for Christmas when I was a child. I always went for several small ones. Metroliner 4558 would have been a big train set, but I really wanted a passenger car. So I bought 4547 with my savings without having the metroliner. I was quite happy when the metroliner was re-released. I bought it with my own money. Then I could finally use the club car with the train it was created for.

In the first 2 pages of the instructions, there are a lot of great pieces. This set would sell like mad if it were released for sale. Parts monkeys alone would go insane buying these up for the dark green and frown pieces: The body of the car consists of black plates, brackets and modified bricks with curved tops that allow the dark green mudguards to just peak out. Cool technique: The grill looks cool using only six pieces. I wish all small sets were this unique and cool: Here's the completed jeep. It looks a little small for an actual jeep, but for a brickmaster set, it's awesome, IMO: Some more detail shots of the set with Indy in the driver's seat: I hope they take BrickMaster exclusives overseas because it'd be awesome if everybody could get these. My buddy CopMike would probably love to be the first to review this set, so I've dedicated my review comic to him: My rating Playability: 8/10 (You need to add some other sets and characters to really play with this set) Design: 9/10 (Great techniques and inclusion of rare parts, but loses a point for being an unrealistic size for a jeep) Price: 10/10 (Part of the BrickMaster package, it is a reasonable prize for an exclusive set and everything else that comes with the subscription) Overall: 9/10 (Great, but not perfect and definitely needs to be offered overseas. LEGO would make a ton of money releasing this for sale, IMO as it really is a terrific small set.)"

More to come in the following days. The Box. Unfortunately I haven't got the box for this set. But peeron.com was kindly enough to support me with a proper pic. And as usual this is a small easily brought home sized box. Oddly TLG doesn't add the ""flip"" on top anymore. I remember standing in toystores, pulling 6 or more sets down from the hanger before accesing the one I wanted. It gave buying LEGO sets that threasure hunting touch. [snaps out of his daydreaming]... A small box with a picture of what you get. I've got no rear pic, so I can't tell if TLG did the same as on the 6701 set (split up the inventory). The fig: One single white classic space minifig. This is the worst one in my opinion. I never liked those white guys. And they get easily damaged by the sun. Nah! Give me a red or yellow instead (later blue or black). The Surface Rover: BOTH I am the lucky owner of two of them. (Yes this is a small showoff ) SIDE Though small, I still think this is a neat little set. Compared to the modern ""impulse"" sets, this is high competable. I like the simplicity of the small classic space sets and this is no exception. The SR is made from very usable bricks, that can easily be used for making ship/base/craft MOCs. REAR As you can see, one of them has been used for surface exploration for many years. It could do with some replacements, but I haven't had the time, yet. The verdict: A fine little classic set. Not much more than that. It holds some useful bricks and worked fine as an ""impulse"" back then. The classic children's birthday presents during the early 80's.

I had this as a little child, and whenever any of my relatives came to visit us, they brought me some Lego. Usually it was either this set or 6844 The really nice thing about this set are the alternate builds. For the low price you got a nice range of parts and cool ideas what to build with them. You could build a fleet of Rovers, or the alternates, and everytime it was huge fun :)"

Another fine review from the Legoland's Desert Down Under. This set makes for an excellent addition to your jungles, deserts, outbacks, or other wild and untamed places. Set #: 6490 Theme: Outback Year Released: 1997 Piece Count: 117 Minifigs: 1 List Price: $15 (USD) Starting with an image of the box, one can conclude that this doesn't look like the Amazon at all, but rather the Outback: On the back of the box are some great alternate models, including a creative idea for a crocodile zoo scene: The instructions have the same images on the front and back: The set comes with one Outback fig, a man dressed in green with a bright red cap - I call him the Crocodile Hunter. Also included in this set is a crocodile, some bones, a skull, backpack, pan, and a few extra trans. round 1x1s. The tools are pictured on the truck: Now here's a great desert/rugged terrain truck: Ready for some 4-wheel'n fun. I love the liftable top window/sun roof and the windshield. I like the use of these colored trans. blue pieces that contrast against the yellow, rather than hide like regular clear pieces: The truck has a few hooks/clips to attach a pick, rifle, antena, and camera. Also attached is a water/oil can and an extra tire that just rests in the back section: The front end of the truck has a great winch and hook to help the truck out of hard places: Working suspension helps the vehicle travel on rough terrain: The truck is just half the fun. This set also offers a nice bridge/creek bed for the truck to drive across: I like the use of six fence/ladder pieces for the bridge. The two in the center have double open sides. Here's the left side: And the right side with a single burp as a mountain/hill: I really like the use of the tan and brown baseplates representing desert and water. The complete set as the Crocodile Hunter tries to climb back into the truck after attaching the winch: Final Thoughts: I've always liked this little set. It offers a great amount of playability with the wonderful little 4-stud wide truck and bridge scene. A few years ago, Playmobil offered a Desert Racing Theme and had this set as my favorite of the collection: Desert racing and adventures through dry creeks and rough terrain make for a great theme. Hope you enjoy this review and consider picking up an Outback set (or two) if you can still buy at a reasonable price. Happy Outbacking! The complete Outback theme: 6444 Outback Airstrip 6487 Mountain Rescue 6490 Amazon Crossing 6550 Outback Desert Racer 6553 Crisis News Crew EDIT: I dedicate this review to the memory of Steve Irwin (1962 - 2006): TRIBUTE"

Great story. I enjoy hearing people reminisce about the fun they had with certain sets. I always wanted Rocky River Retreat but never picked it up. That's a great adventure set as well. I had never thought about mixing the two sets, but they do have components that would compliment one another nicely. If you still have the pieces, you should try restoring the sets - it's a lot of fun. simonwillems, on Aug 6 2008, 04:37 AM, said: This is by far my favourite Outback series set!

The one everyone either hates or defends... What do I think? Read on. The Figs: Bandana Man Masked Dude Dude with Shades Good figures, I miss Scarface. Comes with his torso, though, which is my favorite (the one with the ammo strap across the chest). One figure short of the figure-to-price value, but we can deal with that. The Dino: The Dino. It's the one that comes with the chopper, in green. Any questions? The Tank: And so it begins. I think it looks a lot better in person than on the box. The left side. Good time to mention that the treads run pretty easily, and this is a very playable set. Right side. Keep an eye on that flap in the center... ... and we have a folding ladder! The back. Probably the weakest point of the set, apart from the dino. The turret, turned and tilted. The mechanism works extremely well, and the gun seems to work better than others for some reason (or maybe it just seems that way). The front of the cockpit. I'm at a loss trying to figure out how those TINY windshields defend them against 40-foot mutant tyrannosaurus rexes with radioactive breath, laser eyes, and what have you... Anyway, another one of those neat steering wheels, some Viking horns, and some stickered control panels (oh yeah, this set has a good amount of stickers. Probably around 20-ish.). The back of the cockpit. I love the little gun, it turns 360 degrees and tilts up. Oh yeah, and those green barrels they've been using are awesome, I can think of tons of uses for them. The Verdict: 7.6/10 Playability: 9.4/10 Pieces: 7.5/10 Figures: 8.8/10 Dino: 3/10 Value: 4/10 The MAIN DOWNFALL of this set is the price. I would easily pay $30 for this, no questions asked. But $40 was a hard sell for me - I gave in merely to see what I would think of it, and also to help you guys find out the same. This is a great display set, and a great play set. The pieces are good - lots of nice blay beams used in the construction. But the price, people. That's the killer. Pick this up only if you have everything else or you find it on clearance. And thus ends my Dino Attack review series. Hope you enjoyed them! Until next time, Bloody Jay"

Building time: less than 2 minutes. If it came out in the last months, if would be called an Impulse set. It actually came out a few years ago; being those my ""dark years"", I missed the Arctic line. Now that I'm back into business, I wanted some! But not all of the sets were good (or easily available). I had the chance to buy this one, and I0'm happy with it. As you can see below, it consists of a figure on a scooter; the only accessories are those chainsaws that lie on the sides (unless you take the skis from the scooter and have the minifig wear them!). The extra piece is a TransYellow 1x1 round plate. According to Brickset and Peeron, the difference between box and polybag is the sticker ""sheet"". You choose whether the nose is better with or without the sticker: I'd say ""with"". The judgement: it's cheap, it has a cool minifig with a cool head accessory and a nice torso. I don't think I like that orange colour that much (and I can't understand why those blue pieces have to be... blue; I guess it's beacuse the whole line uses blue with orange!), but I have to say this is definetely a good set. I'd give it a 4 out of 5 in its category. If you want to own at least a set per every theme, this could be your Arctic one.

Here we have the wonderful Droid gunship, one of the cheaper of the Clone Wars sets. This set is exclusive to Wal-mart, and its one of the better Exclusives out there (I'm looking at you, Twilight ). First off we have a Shot of the entire set with the Box. A random Page shot, along with pics of the Parts list. The build is split up into three sections: The Back, The cockpit, and The Missles. The back has a lot of nice dark blue plates, and is the only part of the set which uses stickers. The bottoms shows Various technic systems, which I'll get to later The cockpit has many details (Mostly guns), and the Rotating Guns are a nice touch. The cockpit can fit a battle droid, but not a Minifig. I'm not sure why a Droid would want leather though The last part is loading this baby with the missles There are four Black(small) and two Dark Bley (large) missles which are loaded in groups of three as SLS. the middle mechanism is for the missiles, and the back part with the Bionicle teeth are used ad landing gear The knob on top turns... to release the missiles on the Clones ... Leftover bits and the used SS(not so D this time around) The gunship versus a time traveling Agent Charge . OVERALL Build: 8/10 A basic build, but at some points repetitive. Minifigs: 10/10 Just your basic droids, you can't go wrong. Design: 7/10 A basic design, with some Interesting techniques. Pieces: 9/10 A mix of old and new pieces, along with the return of THIS lovely piece which hasn't been seen for almost 10 years Price: 8/10 $30 for a Gunship? I'll take it! Final Verdict: 8/10 A great price for a small set like this, and It has a great bit of Swooshability"

The theme was really a quasi-Coast Guard sub-theme of Classic Town. The theme included boats, helicopters, emergency vehicles, and even a water hovercraft. Most notable was the black and yellow color combination that predominated the sets. I only picked up a couple of sets from the theme including this Emergency Evacuation vehicle that I consider a van. I never got into the theme, but looking back at these sets, I have gained a better appreciation for their value in Classic Town. Let's take a look at 6445 in greater detail. Starting with the box: The back of the box providing a few alternate models: And similar imagery on the instructions: The set includes one small sheet of decals for the van: 6445 has one Res-Q minifig that I find pretty nice. I like the neon orange reflectors: He has a nice printed backside with the word RES-Q prominently displayed: This little set includes an abundance of tools: A black walkie-talkie is not pictured Here's the emergency van: I like the back section that has a nice winch with turning wheel and a few hooks for tools: Here's the minifig pulling the grappling hook for some Res-Q action. This is my favorite part of this set: The van isn't too fancy but has some neat features: While I like the blue windshield piece for maybe space sets, I'm not really fond of its use for the van: The van has no steering wheel, but rather two levers for steering: On the top of the vehicle are two emergency alarms and some extra lights: The back of the van has a large opening piece that allows wide access to the back section: It comfortably fits a long gurney/stretcher: Here's the driver resting on the gurney: He should never have tried to pick up the gurney without a 2nd Res-Q minifig. And a shot of the back section without the gurney: Lastly, a picture of the complete set: Final Thoughts Res-Q is really a neat theme that has great play value for kids. While it's not one of my more favorite town sub-themes, it does offer some nice pieces and an abundance of black and yellow pieces. I think a few of the Res-Q sets go nicely with the Divers theme released one year earlier in 1997. I had a chance to purchase the largest set of the theme, 6479 Emergency Response Center, at half the price, but passed back in the late 90s. I'd be interested in finding out what other EB members think of this set and the Res-Q theme."

Has to be one of the best vehicles for taking a stretcher with it. The Res-Q line was pretty good. The boat was really good and the hovercraftish thing was great. The best thing, was that scene in some catalogs of that time involving a giant broken bridge with many people and cars falling."

I always liked the slightly futuristic look of their vehicles. Their sets were all the more impressive since they came during the town junior era, at a time when most of the standard town line sucked. I have this Emergency Evac set too and it comes with a very impressive array of tools, more than any other vehicle of its size. I might get another one for the unique parts like the black canopy extender. You can make the minifig slide down the string using one of the tools, which is fun to play around with."

I had never heard of this theme before until I looked into Brickset. I find this theme quite interesting with a mixture of rescue combination of different vehicles cater to a wide arrary of emergency crisis. I find this entire Emergency Response team is pretty fun to play with, especially setting up an evacuation perimeters in danger zones which is affected by earthquakes, tsunami, tornandos and etc. They are a team of specialists, meant to deal with this particular situation. I will rate this theme a ""4"" as I felt that the theme's objective is pretty good, except for some of its vehicles' design which is not really very appealing at a first glance. This may be my perception. After all, this theme was released in my dark age. Back to the review, the 6445 Emergency Evac is a very fun vehicle to play with. The wide abundant of tools such as spade, jackhammer and etc are so useful. The minifig's torso is very nice looking. I thought it was part of Mars Mission. As for the Emergency van, the section at the back offer high playabilty. You have pointed out the playabilty of the grappling hook. Of course, you can't operate this without attaching it to the rear of the van. Otherwise, the entire section will fall off the cliff. From the first look of the van, I don't really like the design. It's not really very appealing. However, the large opening at the back is quite surprising to store the strencher at the back. Although the design is not very nice, but the playing functions do make up for it. If there is an additional minifig with him, I am sure it will be even better. Overall, I could only give this set between a higher 3.5 and 4. Thanks Brickster, for highlighting another enriching review."

I got this set when it came out back then and spent many many hours playing with it, because of the fact having this wench it has got great playability. Since the first moment i loved this theme and i still do today. Allthough the sets itself are not too famous in design, i like the overall look and the colours work well together. You have to think about that these were the years where most of the other vehicles and sets from the city theme were WAY too juniorized, with the exeption of a few sub-themes including Res-Q. I got this set back this year after my dark ages, along with all other sets of this theme, except the hovercraft. I'm looking forward to review some of these very soon, so stay tuned!"

Below average theme: This RESQ theme included some really nice little sets (like e. g. this one) - but the bigger sets were . BTW: As we've seen the great CG theme this year I hope that TLG will release some sort of mountain rescue (at the best with snowy/winter landscape) in the near future which could contain some little nice sets like this one above, too.

I do like the Res Q theme I bought the little rig and the helicopter and the boat. I really like the boat and the helicopter leaves a lot to be desired, No rotors mostly body and a Cobra/Apache seating arrangement only suites an attack helicopter. But all in all a great little set with some great alternate building idea's. Which is one of my biggest peeves with the new sets..... Thanks again Brickster"

They're utterly tiny given the size of the thing. This is trivial to fix yourself though, and it's a great model otherwise. Interestingly, the helicopter in the older (and similar) 6545 Search and Rescue also has the same problem."

I was glad to get it on the second day of its arrival. Over the past few days, I was busy building and writing up this extended detailed review. It shall be my biggest, breathtaking review ever done in Eurobricks. It will be done in 8 parts! May I introduce the 852293, Castle Giant Chess Set. Indeed, this is one of the biggest LEGO set packaging I had ever seen and is much larger than the 10179: Ultimate Collector's Series Millennium Falcon. In terms of weight, UCS MF is much heavier than the Castle Giant Chess set. However, the Chess set storage box is huge. Buyers' Warning: Trust me, if you have intentions to buy this set, please clear your car boot. Make use of retail shops' delivery service if any. Avoid buying at peak hours and used public transport after you bought it. It will be one tiring experience for you to carry it alone. The above scenario is tested by me on its opposite results Name: Castle Giant Chess set Theme: LEGO System / Castle/ Chess Set Year: 2008 Pieces: 2475 Minifigs: 32 Price: SGD$299.90 / USD$199.90 / GBP£139.99 This is the largest Chess set ever released with 32 33 minifigs ranging from humans, dwarves, trolls, orcs and skeletons. Castle Giant Chess set is one single set which offer so many Minifigs. It offers great playability, fun, collection, army building, display and many other possibilities. Previous chess sets which are the Knights Kingdom, Viking and the recent Castle chess set do not have minifigs to represent the rooks and the knights. This is the first chess set ever, to use minifigs to represent all chess pieces. Part 1: Product Showcase Boxart of 852293, Giant Chess set The storage box plus the content, is a huge giant which weighs almost 8kg. The dimension of the box is 61cm (height), 50cm (width) and 17cm (depth). Can you imagine how big this box is? LEGO Shops need to fork out much larger shelf space to showcase to the consumers. In fact, I believe most shops had problems storing it in the shop due to limited space. Below are some pictures displaying its different angle. Rear view. Depth: 17cm thick Storage case's interior This image is behind the chess board Taking a look of the Minifigs from the outside Part 2: Taking the box apart Base of the box This seemed to be the easiest step but the most important step to solve the mystery of using such a giant storage case. At the base of the box, it reveals another 48x48 gray baseplate and a thick instruction manual. Two gray baseplate of 48x48 Take a look at the left baseplate which is featuring the chessboard. Unlike previous chessboards in the past which is glued. This board actually allows us to take the black and white 2x2 flat tiles apart. One square has 9 same color tiles which are 6x6 studs. Just imagine and count how many such tiles are there? It's incredible. Packets of 8 These are the 8 labeled packets full of bricks and accessories. That is the answer to your mystery of the 2000+ bricks/parts source. Opening up Pack number 1 When I opened pack number 1 to begin building, I had noticed something different. There are many more small packets which are labeled as well in this order 1A, 1B, 1C and 1D. I find it surprising. I am not sure if this is something new but I had not built any of my recent sets for quite sometimes. A quick peep into the insturction manual Take a careful look at the building illustration. I believed you had a rough idea of what these bricks actually do. They are supposed to be part of the fun to build up a chess set. At the moment, I do not know how big it will be. You will find out in the later parts. Some nice pictures for viewing from the instruction manual In case, you can't view the wordings well on the third picture. It is describing the four different relams from top left to right as followed, Troll Camp, Skeleton Jail, King's Castle and Dwarf Mine. Part 3: Characters' Introduction Dwarf warriors and miners These are the dwarf warriors and miners that defend the kingdom. You will get instant 8 dwarves in this chess set. Fortunately, none of the dwarves is wearing the silver winged helmet. I had many of these due to multiple Dwarves' Mine Defender. Through this set, I will be able to get more various types of helmet which is very hard to come by as it only available in Dwarves' Mine. You can take a clear look of the chess standing piece of the Dwarves. Castle Defenders The archers came with quiver at the back and equipped with wooden bow instead of crossbow. The tower construction is pretty nice. You could easily use this in your Castle Tower MOCs by adding a watch tower on it. Castle Knights Both knights' attire is of a different kinds. Their barding is different as well. I preferred the left barding as it is uncommon and only available in the King's Castle Siege and Skeleton Tower. The chess standing piece enable the knights to show a fearsome looks, by allowing the steeds to lift their legs. Royal Wizards The wizards, whom protect the royal family. Nothing special about it. These are the usual characters which appeared in the previous Castle Chess set and the Good Wizard impulse set. It seemed the wizards had mastered the lighting bolts. Royal Family The King and Queen each hold a golden goblet. I am not very happy that the King and Queen do not have a cape at the back unlike the previous edition. I believed its due to the thrones that they are sitting. It might obstruct them from standing and damage the cape. However, the thrones are nicely design. I like it very much. Orcs Warriors The orcs are very good. It will be even better if all of them are equipped with the armor instead of 2. However, one good point to note that, all orcs are equipped with a shield. I just love these shields very much. Orcs armies are very easy to build up. The shields and the armor are pretty hard to acquire large amount. They came in limited amount in other sets as well. You can take a clear look of the chess standing piece of the Orcs. Dark Siege The white skeleton crossbow archers are not very appealing.They don't have a quiver at the back and no helmet on its head. I understand that some of us may accept skeletons without headgear. As for me, I can't accept it and will make a point to award a headgear to it. The siege is quite nice. It's mini scale. Kind of reminded me of the mini-models from Star Wars. Dark Knights The Dark Knights ride on the skeleton black horse with different attire as well. Nothing special or expensive about it. The chess standing piece enable the skeleton knights to show a sinister looks, by allowing their undead horses to lift their legs. Trolls Rock There are 2 trolls of the different colors, protecting them with their cubs. The brown troll is a much better choice as it only appear in the Dwarves' mine. Oh no, it's another whacking! Dark Wizard and Witch Without further ado, is the King and Queen of the Dark side. The wizard is the usual typical design. However, the witch which potray as the Queen is the most unique character in the entire set. Although this character will re-appear in the Castle Advent Calender 2008, but it give us a better look of its new face and torso. Personally, I like this new character very much. Part 4: The building process The building process took me almost 4 to 5 hours of slow building throughout the few late nights. I was not able to sit still to complete the entire building. This is your answer to one of the reasons why this set is so costly. Look at the amount of bricks being used in the setup. I can't believe it myself, until I experience it. Packet 2 and 3 Packet 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 Part 5: Four Corners of the realms Dwarf Mine This is my most favourite relams. It has more gold for the dwarves to mine especially on its rock formation where the gold are found. A hot steam stove melting the resources. King's Castle This is a very nice castle tower layout which can be used to expand on your castle grounds. Just love these lion bricks on its side. Troll Camp The troll camp is a defensive structure by placing their spears at the front, to prevent attackers from moving ahead. The larva pieces, from the Agents Volcano base, are really very nice to illustrate some larva or flaming substance that flows at the side. Skeleton Jail An evil holding ground for the skeletons to hold their prisoners behind these claws, leaving them to rot over time, changing them into an undead as well. Part 6: Weapons by the side of the chess Overall view of the weapons from all sides Some close-up views Part 7: Giant Chess Set is complete The entire chess set is very huge and is indeed deserved the name of the Giant LEGO Castle Chess set. Let's take a look at the chess board without the chess pieces in place. With the pieces in place Leftovers I am quite surprised that I had quite a number of spare parts left. I wonder if I had built everything correctly. For people whom had bought this and built it as well, let me know if you have as much spare bricks left as I do? The game shall begins Part 8: Bonus features A special version chess set shall be created by WhiteFang. You can see that this giant chessboard offers many possibilties. Such as the Yellows Minifigs versus the Fleshies Minifigs. Disclaimer: All minifigs used by WhiteFang are not injured, damaged or hurt in any forms. Yellow Minifigs formation Fleshie Minifigs formation Who said it will be a chess competition? To summarise, this is a very impressive, superme chess set ever released by TLG. It's really very beautiful, just by looking at it. I am very happy with the building experience and the entire feature. It's a ""must get"" if you are able to afford it. The only downpart is its hefty pricetag. Other than that, I love it very much, especially the dwarves. As a castle collector and lover myself, this is indeed one of the most ultimate chess set ever known in entire TLG 50 years history! Summary review Playability: 9/10 (The chess pieces designed and the relams certainly makes the chess set looks lively) Design: 9/10 (This design has set the new standards for future chess sets. However, I hope that the future sets won't be as costly as this) Price: 8/10 (The set is very expensive but quite reasonable after taking into considerations of the bricks, parts and minifigs.) Overall: 8.7/10 (I enjoyed and loved this set very much! A outstanding superb display) I gave it a ""5"" based on my Review Score Card. What about yours? Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. Comments and Critics are strongly welcomed. More and more pictures can be found in My Brickshelf(When moderated)"

I really enjoyed the review, and it is nice to see closeups of some of the features like those at the corners, and the siege towers. I also had not realised the board was elevated, using two boards - one for the base and one for the playing board. However, I am now wondering if I can get a couple 48x48 boards, some 2x2 black and while tiles, and actually build this set (probably with substitutions) given that I own the entire Castle '07 + '08 line up (plus extras) and a huge collection of Lego already. Of course this is dependant on getting hold of the instructions somehow (maybe they will be on the Lego site?). I for sure can't fork out the €200 (too much Lego spending already, probably well over €2000 in the last year), which is a pity. It's well worth it by the looks of it. However I don't play chess much, and couldn't bear to get this just for parts, or to keep as a gigantic ornament. I had already surmised from a recent photo of the Lego Castle Advent calendar coming out this September that the witch has the Claw-dette head (I recently got the Volcano base, and the head is one of the coolest recent heads)."

Based on my leftovers, it seemed a friend of mine, MoNd2 (Raymond) had just spotted and pointed some of my mistakes while I was building it, and managed to place some of the extra bricks back to where it belongs. The affected pieces, are the Witch, King, Queen, Good Wizards and Knights pieces. It does not really affect the overall look. Somehow, I just want to make this set complete.

Year: 2001 Set Number: 6776 Original Price: $49.99 USD Swooshabillity: (Of the rocket) 6/10 Play Value 7/10 Instructions Random Page This was kind of neat. The different sections of the set were packed in 3 boxes: The Boggle Rocket, The landing pad and bottom floor, and the tower. Here is the little river that the sub from 7664 fits. This pit under the landing pad looks like one of those tunnels where the exhaust goes. I just love those trans-orange cones! Don't find those much anymore! This was kind of neat, though there should be a door of some sort to keep prisoners in. Also theres not much of a point for the stairs. If you turn the skull orbs fall into a little dumper. Then the dumper loads the orbs into the rocket: Then the bottom closes and locks. Another way to load the orbs is to stuff them through the opening side. This tiny control center goes in the middle of the bottom floor. This would be useful for brickfilms. Heres a mini escape-copter for Ogel to get away in while his Drones hold off AT. Ogel is happy watching his minions do intensive labor. But if the AT comes along and shoots the two pillars back, Ogel's lookout spot crashes. Ouch! Part 2: The Boggle Rocket It comes in 3 sections: The cockpit, the cargo bay, and the engine. Open the little box on the side, and random skulls are inside. There isn't much point to this, but at least there is something inside. Part 3: The Figs This set includes Ogel, and two drones. It's really too bad these guys haven't appeared in any other sets, as they are cooler looking then all the others and there is supposed to be an army of them. Here is Ogel. Unlike the other two subthemes, he has no hook. Up close (Sorry about the blurrines ) Weird how on BL there is The Drone Commander and the Drone minion. I have no idea where where they got the idea. The comic is different from the comic in the instructions inventory on Peeron. I think it was changed after 9/11. And That is it! The pure simplicity of the build takes away from the play value, as I could build it in like, 30 seconds If you are an AT fan though, DEFINETELY GET IT!"

When rumours of the set name first circulated, speculation was swift: 'Twilight - that suggests something sleek, elegant and mysterious.' Anticipation mounted! Fan-frenzy grew! Finally a pic leaked! And the verdict was... 'clunk-a-dunk' It appeared that in the Jedi off-season, Anakin was running something that looked like an intergalactic garbage scow, like Roger Wilco in the old Sierra Space Quest PC games. Blocky and bley seemed to sum it up. The set went from being one of the most anticipated to one of the least liked of 2008 pretty much instantly. It's a mark of that dislike that in the EB Clone Wars review feeding frenzy nobody has so far even bothered to post a few pics of this set even 2 weeks after it's official release! I'm here to redress that imbalance now and find out if 7680 is as horrendous as everyone originally thought Part 1: Box & Parts Front of the box. It's quite big, same size as the 10144 Sandcrawler. Annoyingly, it's the old style with the perforated corners that you have to tear to flip open the lid. Detail of the back, showing set functions: Interior of the box - a lot of wasted space. The set comes with 2 instruction manuals, each 76 pages. And no DSS sheet! Polybags! 13 of 'em. Like the other CW sets, these are unnumbered. Parts ahoy! You can tell at a glance that this set is comparable to the AT-TE, although there a large proportion of the 800+ parts here are technic pins and bley plates. Part 2: Minifigs and Build The set comes with 4 figs (or 3.5, depending on how you look at Rotta ): Anakin, Ahsoka, R2-D2 and Rotta. Very disappointing that there's nothing new here for such a high-priced exclusive, although I guess it is maybe movie accurate. Anyway, to paraphrase the wise Patsy Stone, you can never have enough hats, shoes or new Anakin/ Ahsoka hairpieces so it's not too bad. Pics of the build in progress. A quarter of the way through we can already see that this is one of those 'convoluted technic frames with some plates affixed' type builds: Half-way and the smaller wing is added: At the three quarter mark the giant single wing is added: And voila! Done! The final quarter is a race to attach all the exterior surfaces and details such as the engine and escape pod. The build itself is a mixed blessing. It is VERY technic oriented. I'm not a Technic-ally minded person and don't really have much of a conceptual grasp of how everything functions until I see the final result, so I find these type of builds a little uninteresting. Pins, axles and beams? Give me bricks any day! I really liked the 7676 Gunship and the 7679 Fighter Tank although they do contain some technic framework, they are largely brick-built ships, especially the Fighter Tank which is solid, largely brick built and full of neat functions. The 7680 build is one of the most technicy builds I've ever undergone in a System set, akin to the experience of building the 10178 Motorised AT-AT. But whereas with that set you could understand the need for a technic framework (the thing walks!) a lot of this seemed excessive. Yes, the Twilight does some have nice functions, and it is so large and heavy it does need a strong skeleton, but to me it just seemed too much and aesthetics have been sacrificed for (in some cases limited) functionality. I will discuss in more detail what I mean as I look at different parts of the set. On the upside, this is the only non-symmetric set in the CW range, so at least every page and new step brings something different! Part 3: A Closer View Close-up of the main body of the ship: Front-on. It is well-designed how the figs appear in line of sight (unlike the 6211 where Jabba and Leia were photoshopped in to the box art). Don't ask what Rotta is doing out of the line of vision there. Some things are better left unsaid. Side view, showing escape pod (smaller cylinder) and drive: Top view: Rear view, showing back door. The rear deck is huge. Indeed, the whole ship is huge. Oddly so. I don't know if this is movie-scale or not, but I've seen people complain the fighter tank is too big (!) and that set is nothing compared to this baby! It's wider than the Gunship and in wingspan and length is almost bigger. Here's a few pics next to an MTT for comparison. Pretty big, hey? Turning to the dark side must be good for business. Even if all you can buy is a rusty old beast like this, at least you could comfortably squash pretty much every vehicle in the opposing fleet just by landing on it. At least now you can see why it costs so much. The official pics make it look smaller, somehow, by truncating the rear and wing. The ship is in fact so big you can't really pose it with wings open - only hold it that way. I was too lazy to build a giant trans-clear support strut so propped it up on a shoebox instead. The wing opens very neatly - you push a technic lever and a pin holding the bottom wing pops out quite smoothly. The little top turret can move up and down as well to get the full cross-shaped effect. Part 4: Features and Functions The front cockpit folds down very neatly, although I find the build here a little weak. Whee! It goes all the way down to the floor. The mechanism is cool, but it takes up an awful lot of space. Basically the whole front is cockpit and all Lego could manage for controls is 2 printed 1x2 tiles as well (not pictured here, but they're attached to the part that folds up and down). There's also no way for anyone to get in or out of the cockpit. And an invisible windscreen! Technology has come a long way. Side view, looking from wing. R2D2 is here as well as some tools. You can also glimpse here one of the main problems with the set. Despite being a huge boxy ship, there's no interior! None! The Twilight doesn't even have an internal floor. All the room inside is taken up by the landing gear which folds up - again, a clever function but it really gets in the way of the set as a whole. Kudos to the designer for coming up with stable, working landing gear, but too clever by half if it means that this giant ship ends up basically being one tiny cockpit and a rear door at the back that doesn't lead to any interior! Underside showing landing gear when open: And closed - when the wing is folded down, the gear is locked in place, which is pretty neat. Space-consuming, but neat. The rear section. The door, when opened, reveals an orange cupboard and a tow-line, as Ahsoka uses in the box art. The door clicks into place when open and can be released by pressing the technic bit at the top. Again, clever, but pointless as you can't get inside! Ahsoka can indulge in a little recreational bungee-jumping if she so wishes: The rear deck is so large that it is wasted just being used so Ahsoka can bungee-jump. I came up with a much better use for it. Outdoor garden! Despite having one roboticised hand, Anakin was still quite the green thumb. And his light-saber was very useful as a hedge trimmer. So much so that he set up a side business between Rotta-rescue missions. Here's a promotional postcard: A few other bits and pieces. The gun turret on the enormous mega-wing can only hold one flick fire missile at a time (you do get two, though ) Rear engine detail: The escape pod sits neatly on the side and is basically built the same way as the Gunship bacta tank: The pod sits on these tehcnic pins and is held in place by the light bley parts: Part 5: In conclusion The Twilight is a huge ship, with a huge amount of great functions - folding wing, folding cockpit, rear door, escape pod, retractable landing gear! But this functionality comes at a price - a very complex technic build and zip interior. Compared with the Gunship, for example, which is stuffed with nooks and crannies, the Twilight suffers in this respect. I also think it is just too large - it doesn't really fit with the other craft and vehicles released with the Clone Wars line. I may be wrong and it is movie-accurate, but when you have all the CW sets laid out it does stick out like a poor thumb. Part selection is OK, with the only interesting things being a few dark orange plates, the orange cupboard and the big trans-neon green radar dish. Don't get me wrong, I don't think this is a bad set at all. It's just the other CW sets are so sweet! I would say it's an above average set in a field crammed with excellent ones. If you're a completist, buy it, but if for example you'd rather invest in another AT-TE to upgrade your Republic Army, then I couldn't really disagree with you either And to finish on a light note, I'd like to remind you that you do get another Ahsoka hairpiece, which can be used for all sorts of things. Ugha warrior upgrade: Dr Inferno hair transplant: And finally, attack of the deadly blue-ringed octopus, native to Australia's beaches and oceans! Thanks for reading!"

I enjoyed reading this review very much and I felt that you have redress Twilight in an approriate manner. I have very mixed feeling about this set especially with its design. It seemed I will need to watch the Clone Wars movie in the theatre before I compared with it. Most of the time, when this LEGO set is used in a movie, you will tend to compare it and what is the actual purpose for Twilight, same as the rest of the SW vehicles and aircraft. For a high price like this, I can actually top up a little more and get the AT-TE, with the same batch of minifigs plus Commander Rex. If there is a special figure such as the V19 Torrent (Clone Pliot), it will be a much ideal scenario. At the moment, I have not bring in any Clone War sets into my collection, and I am quite sure Twilight is not in my priority list especially when I am not a full-pledged Star War collectors or I have strong intentions to complete the entire range in this recent release. Therefore, I need to prioritise my purchase, and likely to get two RGS, since that is my favourite ship in Clone War era. I am not comparing it with RGS. Both sets defintely have their pros and cons. Oh, I love that postcard you made. Certainly looks very nice! svelte_corps, thanks for doing up this superb detailed review which had given ""Twilight"" the neccessary attention it should have."

I think a lot of people feel the same way - there was so much good stuff to get in the first wave that this is probably a backburner set for a lot of people, and some are probably waiting to see the movie to see how prominently it features. I will try and take a pic with some other CW sets, I don't have all of them though and some need to be reassembled as I built them on holiday and then had to pack them away I do think this line of sets has been the best SW Lego wave released though. All of the recent releases have been amazing in their own way."

It put the set in context with people's changing thoughts about it. It commented on the box, why do such expensive sets have such ordinary boxes? The photography was outstanding. Every issue that a builder could have with it was discussed in a calm and rational manner. I have the same issues with technic structured sets, and svelte_corps summed up my feelings on this beautifully. This was an even handed review, so thoughtful. Finally, you gotta love a bit of humour in a review, that gardenis brilliant. I was probably never going to get this set anyway but it sets a new world's best standard for reviews. I strongly encourage anyone that's going to review a set to have a good look at this to see how well it can be done. Thanks for the magnificent review!"

Your photos were really nice and there have been some reviews lately that have such blurry pics... cough.. cough... it was a pleasure to see you can 1. put lego bricks together 2. write a review 3. handle your camera! I think this ship is underrated, it is really nice! I love the playing features like landing gear and back door, perhaps just cause I had to get along with so called landing gears in the past, that did not work at all (7140 for example..). And I simply LOVE that there is space inside. You said there is not really some cause of the landing gear mechanism, but it seems it should be easily fixed. Do you think there is enough space to put some plates over the landing gear and add some beds, kitchen und TV? I think this set is so perfect to mod it into a Clone Wars mobile home, your back garden ist just perfect for this. I prefer this over the AT-TE and over a 2nd gunship! Thanks a lot for the review!"

The main thing is that it simply looks akward. It is big and bulky, and seems to have random pieces on it with not reall streamline feel to it. I also agree that for an exclusive that it $100, it needs more than just 3.5 mini figures. Anikan and Ashoka and Rotta already come in the AT-TE, which is cheaper and has more figures. R2-D2 is a figure that I am sure everybody has at least 4 or 5 of. For that kind of money, I expect something with at least one unique figure, and more than 4. I also want just a cleaner and better designed set. This is probably the letdown of the collection so far. Every collection needs one."

The Castle theme has got well designed boxes :) The whole set (build): 2 knights, jousting fence and weapon rack. The Weapons Rack: Another great addition of weapons. Flail, halberd and skeleton scimitar. Super weapons for those close encounter melee battles fought when tipped off the horse : :grin:P The Jousting Fence: Not much to say. It's a fence. Simple, yet it serves it's purpose very well. The Crown Knight: Gotta love that guy. He looks like nothing can hurt him. He even got a selfsufficient smile on his face. I'm sure he's convinced that no skeleton can defeat him. Also the horse, it's barding and the headcover looks awesome. A great old school sword and the ever cool normannic shield. What could possibly go wrong for this knight? The helmet I really love. IMO it's a lot better than the old knight helmets (see review of 5615 The Knight for a pic of one of those). The Skeleton Knight: The black skeleton horse ROCKS! I love that design and in black it's even badder than than the white version. The shield reeks of dread and the knight is one bad skeleton on the rampage. I do find that the helmet is a little off! I'd rather have a black knights helmet instead. The KK helmet doesn't really do it for me. The All in All verdict: This is another great army builder set. It holds a lot of great weapons, some cool minifigs and great pieces. The only thing that puzzles me is; why would a Crown Knight joust a Skeleton? Doesn't really make sense. KimT"

Thanks to a silly TLC decision, 7009 was not available in Italian stores. I finally decided to buy it on the net (2x , plus some other sets) and those morons at the Custom charged me quite a lot. After I bought it, while waiting for it to arrive, I found out it was available in a store in Switzerland, not far away from home... That's for the storytelling. As for the set, I thought it was great, and still think so. A good army builder (as quite a few sets in the 2007/2008 castle line), and a time traveller (6021 being my first Lego Castle set ever).

Given that in prior years it wasn't possible to get a barded horse in such a small set, this set is actually a decent way to build a mounted cavalry for your kingdom. Looking at bricklink, it would probably cost as much to buy the Knight, horse and weapons separately, and that doesn't take into account the skeleton or the extra bricks. Despite my indifference to this set, I actually have purchased four of them in the past year simply because there isn't a cheaper way to acquire a mounted knight.

The Castle 07 barding here is very nice, indeed the colour scheme of the new Castle guys is great IMO, the light blue and blue work nicely together and against the grey background. I don't really like the pearl grey helmet - it would be nicer in metallic silver like the visor I think. Interesting comment re: the skellie helmet - I guess black normal knight's helmet with visor would be quite nice for him. I got this set as part of the Complete Castle Collection from S@H. However, I have extras of all the smaller sets and Skeleton Tower, except I don't have another one of this set. It's on my list of sets to buy. Unfortunately it wasn't on S@H for Ireland when I was making later orders - quite an odd omission. Also last year Castle '07 was exclusive to Argos (UK catalogue retailer) who only had three sets (not the joust). I should see if the local toy store has it now though, as they did stock some '07 Castle in addition to '08 at the start of the year. I think small sets like this should be well stocked in shops for a year or two - it surely doesn't do their sales much good to be so sporadically available? Sorry, turned into a bit of a ramble. Anyways, the point is that this set is good enough I'd pick up another. The Cobra: that sucks about customs. I try to keep my orders to within the €23 duty-free limit for here in Ireland. If your imports are waylaid you pay 20% import duty, 21% sales tax, and a postage fee for the diversion to customs. NASTY! Edited by brickzone, 13 August 2008 - 11:15 AM."

Feel free to comment on the review and/or set also. Thanks . The set is average. It's useful for picking up a few knights, but I'm not really partial to the skeleton. The idea of a knight and a skeleton tilting just strikes me as being odd. My biggest issue with the current castle line is that most sets force you to purchase a mixture of skeletons/knights orcs/knights orcs/dwarves etc.. This is fine for those of you who love your fantasy, however it makes the line a bit underwhelming for the rest of us. Still, as mentioned earlier the set does have an upside so it is worth a purchase. The review on the other hand is aces with great photos and a detailed description of the set and its contents. Nice work."

I'm not a big fan of castle, having very few sets, all of them spanning different nations/armies, but I couldn't resist this set. And while not obvious at first, it really is backwards compatible with every castle set with a horse in it. Nonetheless, I think this set is great. It's simple, cheap and has charm.

Pictures are clear and show each of the pieces in great detail. I agree with your comments as well. I'm a bit curious, does the knight's helm have a hole for plume? I've been debating whether to purchase this set or not. I'm not a big fan of horses so I'll likely barely use them, but I do like the unique minifigs, weapon rack/weapons, and the fact that the divider has a few useful pieces that can be added to other sets. However, I just don't feel the set is worth $8 when compared to Crossbow attack and the Knight's Catapult unless the buyer is really wanting some mounted minifigs. Luckily, Amazon just lowered their price of this set from $8 to $6 (along with another 20% if using Bill Me Later... just in case anyone was also in the same situation I was in). At that price, it's damn well worth it."

The knight's helm does have a spot for a plume. Now, I really like this set and it was the first one I dug into when I got my collection in the mail. It has a great selection of equipment for good or evil figures and the barding for the horse is outstanding. My only wish was for one of the long chrome swords for the knights. I think the new knights with the tall shield and chrome sword look excellent on foot and on horseback. It would definitely be neat to revisit this set with another human knight instead of the skeleton. Make that change and add a lady to joust for and it'd be bang on."

There were quite a few sets in the 1980's that weren't sold in the US. I remember reading once that it was because they contained wine glasses and TLG felt they wouldn't be able to market a toy that encourage the drinking of alcohol. This set was one of them. I remember seeing this in a catalog that came with a Fabuland set and wondering what it was and where I could get one. I wrote to LEGO and got an overseas catalog which had the Futuron 6990 Monorail Transport System in it before it was available in the US. I was amazed. I ended up buying 6349 Holiday Villa from that catalog but, for some reason, gave it to my best friend for his birthday. I've always wanted this set and finally bought it from Bricklink this year.... My purchase included everything except the box. I really like the boxes. But, in lieu of a boxshot, here is the instruction manual: I imagine this was the image on the front of the box: The parts One of the things that appealed to me about this set is it's abundance of rare parts. This base plate is an excellent piece and was only available in two sets: Classic LEGO telephone: Technically, these blue windows 1 x 4 x 5 windows are only available in this set, according to Bricklink. It was available in different form (with and without fixed glass, trans blue glass) in other sets. Regardless this size and color window is rare and the blue door was only available in 4 sets. This was a huge selling point for me as I'm a window monkey. Never heard that term? It's like a parts monkey (a collector who buys mulitples of sets just for parts or large lots of bulk from BL and sorts them into bins) but just for windows. Tell your friends I coined the term: These sloped windows have endless possibilities in many themes (maybe not with the curtain decals applied) but are another great rare part that appears in this set: The build Remember this piece? I'd like to see a badass Agents car built on this car base! : I am a fan of the six-wide car but I see the appeal of the four wide. It has a very nostalgic feel to it: There's no denying that this is a beauty of classic LEGO 4-wide cars: This set comes with two mini-figures, one of which appears to be a painter. Classic vintage LEGO figs: Onto the house which begins with the basic floorplan: A kitchen that's open to the rest of the house and a little oven and hood vent is one of my favorite touches. It's one thing to throw an oven into a house set, but the designer of this set made it a cool part of the architecture of the house which gives it a unique feel: The completed first floor and carport: I do wish the sides of the roof were white with a little overhang like an actual roof. This method of white on bottom, red on top looks more like a child's drawing than a real house. This is easily fixed with some modifying. Still, you get a lot of roof pieces in this set: Here we have the completed set. The husband cleans the yard while the wife gets plastered on wine. Don't tell the American kids! Another angle: Working in the kitchen: Getting smashed before dinner. I think she may have a serious problem: The bedroom. A little stark, but the bed looks comfy: Overall shot of the interior: Rating Playability: 9/10 (The possibilities are endless with Drunky McWine-Wine and husband. Really, playability is up to the imagination of the player. It's a house, not really very action-packed.) Design: 9.5/10 (Great design with plenty of rare parts. Love the classic car, too! Loses half a point for the all red roof...) Price: NA (I believe this was inexpensive, but since I have no proof, I will have to leave this factor out of the overall rating.) Overall: 9.25/10 (Classic sets like this all deserve 10s in my book, but looking at it with an objective eye it's Excellent, but not perfect.)"

Three out of the eight promotional sets are under Town theme. The third in the line is the Exterme Team sub theme which is promoted in 1998. Extreme Team is a bunch of adventurous, daring, breath taking individuals that risk their lives for an unforgettable excitement of the lifetime. Their vehicles range from land, air and sea type of extreme taking types. Extreme Team is one the unknown themes ever released in my ""Dark Age"". I only had this small lovely set in my Entire Extreme Team collection. Hope we are able to see more interesting reviews under Extreme Team as well. Name: Extreme Team Raft Theme: LEGO System / Town / Promotional / SHELL Year: 1998 Pieces: 19 Minifigs: 1 Price: USD$2.00 An image of a 2537, Extreme Team, Raft This will be an exciting water adventure! This is another great addition to your female population count. She is one of thhe daring individuals in the Extreme Team, that take her raft beyond limit, into the rough waters where she might face possible dangers. Look how confident she is, with those witty eyes of her. I am very sure she will survived the course of her entire journey. Raft's Design This is a very simple design, with just a big piece of wooden plank and a couple of logs tied together on the side, and it is ready to take it down to the water. Speaking of some real adventure, do you dare to take this raft in the unknown waters? There is a small holding area, where she is able to place her critical equipment to ensure her safety throughout the journey. Bottom of the raft Excellent range of equipment This set actually provides very good range of equipment. There is a pair of oars, hammer, life vest and backpack. The most wonderful piece of equipment is the pair of dynamites. First of all, they are printed. Next, they can be used in Wild West or any playing possibilites which involved in explosives. This is a very good impulse set to stock up these accessories. I wondered what she need to use these dynamites for? Her Extreme Team black jacket is very nicely designed, with their logo ""X"" or another way of saying ""Xtreme"". I find the green arms and black jacket matched pretty well, with that blue cap. Front view Relaxing herself, listening to the calm sea To summarise, this is one of the better impulse sets ever produced. It comes with a simple raft with tons of good accessories, and a very cheap way to obtain dynamites. In fact, these are my only 2 piece in my entire collection. Somehow, this set managed to find its way to my collection in my Dark Age, and I am very pleased to have this. No major flaws on this set, it fufill the conditions of an excellent impulse set! Summary review Playability: 9.5/10 (High playability involved. You can used it as an Indy, Adventurers or whatever purpose for the raft) Design: 10/10 (Very very simple design with superb great accessories. For a promo/impulse set, it's very good) Price: 9.5/10 (A very inexpensive set based on the 1998 pricing. Great way to buy this to add in some adventures of your own) Overall: 9.7/10 (This is a fanastic set, mainly for its accessories. Get it if you still see any of these. It's defintely worth the money, if its reasonable) I gave it a ""5"" based on my Review Score Card. What about yours? Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. Comments and Critics are strongly welcomed. Pictures can be found in My Brickshelf (When moderated)"

It seemed some are unfavour of the raft's design. Well, I think for an impulse set. The raft's design is quite good. At least, it took care of the color scheme well. It's just a simple raft for the adventurer to move onto the river stream and throw some dynamitte to blow some obstacles away. Cpt.

The set offered a pretty modern helicopter, raft, three-wheeler, rescue gurney and net, and three figs including a diver. The set is action-packed and offers a high degree of play value. Starting with the box, front side and back: Front Back I always liked the rough ocean/sea water pictured in the boxart. The same image from the front of the box appears on the cover of the instructions: But the back of the instructions picture a plain view of the copter: One sticker sheet with a few ""Res-Q"" stickers is included, mainly for the tail section of the helicopter: Interestingly, the set includes three figures, one being a diver. What I always found strange is the inclusion of an ""X-Treme Team"" Diver who has the logo on his torso (although it's a very nice fig): Back shot: I think this was my first set with a Lego three-wheeler. I always liked it a lot: The set includes a yellow raft (also found in the Divers sets) and some scuba gear: NOTE: the raft has a black piece in it's center for lifting up by the helicopter For sea and emergent rescue, a gurney can also be lifted by the helicopter: The set also includes a net with hook to lift the three-wheeler and other items. An extra string pulls the net closed: Here's a shot of the helicopter: The front section has a large trans. blue piece enclosing the cockpit: Inside is a printed radar slope: A smaller trans. blue piece appears a bit higher for access to the middle section of the helicopter and/or a small storage area: In the middle section is an place for the gurney and a box for storing some of the adventure gear: Here's a picture showing the gurney: On the side is a pulley mechanism that swings to the right when not in use: On the opposite side is the winch to raise and lower the grappling hook: Here's a picture of an open storage box: I like the tail section with propeller: Decal is not shown Here's another shot of the copter from a different angle: And the final image, the entire set: Final Thoughts Personally, I think this is pretty nice set. I like the thought of using the helicopter to rescue people at sea using the working winch. Extras like the trike/three-wheeler and the rescue net make the set even more fun. Hope you enjoy this Res-Q review."

It's quite big and has got place for 2 minifigs in the cockpit. I also like the fact that there's a victim included in form of the x-treme diver, which also is a theme i always loved as a kid. Do you have any other Res-Q sets left to review? It would be an honour for me to also do a review of one or more sets which are left, but unfortunately i got not much time at the moment."

It's not common to see such a big scale helicopter which has two cockpits back then. The color scheme works well for me. With so much features such as the lowering of the grappling hook, storage box, storing of the gurney and etc. One thing which can be improved onto the helicopter is the rotors. It could be extended a little longer as the size of the helicopter is too big. It makes the rotors rather weak as it is not able to support the weight. I am confused why there is an extreme team personnel there. I thought he was supposed to be recovered from the Res-Q team? Although there is so many questions in my head such as why include the black tri-cycle bike, Extreme Team, and etc but this is still one very good set to play with. Too bad, I had never seen this before. Somehow, through your review, I like it very much. The only big scale helicopter which I owned is the 7738 Coast Guard Helicopter and Lift Raft. Neverthless, I gave this a ""4"". Thanks Brickster."

The the stretcher, minifig designs and rescue logo are the only things about this copter that really suggest that it is a civilian rescue aircraft. It's a toy set with alot of play value, but I agree with Karto that these kind of desgins really turned me off to alot of the TOWN and CITY sets of the 90's. On the positive side, the new CITY sets, with thier realistic non-futuristic designs have really tempted me to buy more vehicles."

I really like the torso and its ""genericness"" so it can be used for other factions. And at least this set has 2 shields (althought I prefer the triangular ones) instead of just 1 shield you get from crossbow attack (from the wrong fraction, I'd have liked a crown knights shield 100x better). Some improvements for this set would be a normal bow and a sword instead of 2 of the 3 crossbows, smaller wheels and triangular shields. 4/5 from me (actually 3,5 but I'll round it up)"

I've also used the set as an addition to my Wild West town. The tan baseplate and windmill works great, just subtract the plane, modern equipment, and figs. And lastly, as the set was intended, as an Outback/desert airstrip. Set Description: Outback Airstrip Set # 6444 Pieces: 157 Minifigs: 3 Release Date: 1997 Original Price: $20 (USD) Starting with the box: And the backside. Notice the alternate models. I love the swamp boat: The building is my favorite part of the set. It is simple, has a little detail, two great roof pieces, and a single green window (great piece!): Check out the great windmill piece. It's my only one and makes a great part for Wild West and that farm you always wanted to build. I used it for the Barnhouse of Barnabas Higgens and Spring Valley Ranch On the side of the building is a great radio and a clear glass: Unfortunately, no furniture can be found within the building: And now the airplane: Front view; I love the twin propellors: Side view: And the rear section: The back has a small cargo hold for some boxes/freight or some gear needed in the Outback: The set includes three figs, two with cool shades: And some great equipment. I love the boom box: A shot of the whole set: And another: Summary: As I mentioned above, this set is very versatile and can suplement a few different themes. It's my personal favorite of the Outback collection and I'm really glad I was able to find the set in the late 90s (I almost didn't buy). Sets like this are timeless and so much fun to build and display. Hope you enjoy the review.

It was originally given to me for my birthday by a close friend of mine back in the release year of 1997. The cargo plane was, by far, my favorite vehicle ever. Unfortunately, someone stole the plane from me when our families went on vacation and the rest of the set was given to my cousin's oldest son when I was no longer interested in my LEGO collection. Now that I'm back into LEGO, I use that building's construction for various projects, especially as a Dr. Inferno look-out shack using parts from extra Mission 3: Swamp Raid. The shack compliments the original set greatly. Edited by Skorpius47, 19 August 2008 - 01:44 AM."

As far as I know it was never released in the UK so the only reason I managed to get my hands on it was on a family holiday to the US, I think they’d only recently opened the Lego store in Disney. Arguable the best feature is that it seems to fit into a wide selection of themes, is it a airstrip in the middle of nowhere, is it next to a only mining town that’s not deserted the possibilities are rather open and that’s truly great."

As I rebuild it and took pics of it, I found that I actually like this set for different reasons. Dooku's speeder is pretty cool and the lightsabre rocks. The Dooku minifig is also great. What's not so great is the flythingy and getting another Yoda. Though that's kinda hard not to get in a set focused on their duel ""You can't see the wires, because they digitally removed them."" ""Be careful or I'll digidally remove your head"" - Steven Seagal [I hope I quoted that one right ] So to get the review on the move, I'll impress you all with a box picture: Neat, huh? One of the smaller boxes, but still kinda big when consider that you only get 74 pieces and 2 minifigs. The instruction isn't that big As I said, the Dooku minifigs is awesome I love the print on his torso that combines the brown cape with the torso and also the head is neatly designed. Not a fleshie, though. This was before the flesh-license-facelift A sideview of the light blue speeder. Mmmm that crome light sabre hilt is nice The design of the speeder is also ok, and without the usual off-colour-scheme bricks. No tan or yellow sticking out there Yeah, I'd panic too if this came right at me...who wouldn't when noone's driving? And a rear shot. I think the design is a little off. The shields makes it all a little too open in my opinion. The printed bricks are a kick and thus evens the score here. This hideous design is meant to flip Yoda around the air. Put him in this funfair from Hell thing and give him a twister he and Dooku will never forget. My guess is that it's there to add some playability, but it's just odd and quite useless. Much like the playability soccer thingies in the Ultimate Light Sabre Duel The Verdict: Ups and downs. This set offers both. I rate it as ""Average"" since the size and price of the set make it acceptable to have odd things. Confused? Good so am I Making a small set isn't that easy and remeber this set is from 2002 and a lot has happended since then, designwise that is. What do you think?"

Oldies reviews(old sets ) Are always appreciated. I feel this set isn't that great. 1- Yoda: He is by far the best part of the set. Although, is his weapon blue? 2-Lord Tyrannus: Pretty nice! I feel the middle part of his torso is a bit bland, but that isn't a problem. I wish they would make a fleshie one too. 3- Speeder bike: I always hated this design. The back looks terrible to me. Way too bulky in my opinion. It jusn't give me the image that it's the same as the movie. The lightsaber is amazing! Why is it only in this set? 4-Yoda-Lifter: What? That is terrible. But at least it has some nicely colored parts.... A fine set, but not the best IMO."

At that time, it was still in my dark age and I hated myself not to get this set earlier. This is quite inexpensive and you are able to get two greatest characters especially Count Dooku. The minifigs are excellent, especially the unique design of Count Dooku's lightsaber. I have no problem with the speedbike, as it looks quite alright to me. As for the elevation of Yoda's jump adds some playabilty, but that does not work well for me. Nevertheless, the main attractive factor is Count Dooku and I have to rate it a ""5"".

Of the initial Episode II Lego releases this set was the least inspiring, but the minifigs were must-haves. You can't go wrong with Count Dooku and Yoda! I like the design of Dooku's speeder in the movie but Lego missed the mark a bit with it here and gave him a dodgy flying boat instead! The speeder cradle/Yoda jumping mechanism was just a waste of parts unfortunately. I'd like to see Dooku's speeder re-imagined by Lego. They've come a long way in the way they design a lot of the new Star Wars sets"

Here we have the box. It is really shiny, and smooth, and fits the set's size okay. It has a clean, bright look, and is truley outstanding. The back of the box, which has the features of the set, as well as the other three CW sets. The contents The siticker sheet. No to bad, and the stickers have clear backs, which is always nice. Instructions Here we have the figs(two new droids and one older armed droid for the cockpit), and the extra parts. The build starts with the flat base. Pretty simple. The bottom. The side lasers. Next is the head: It starts pretty soild. The side buble laser turrets. Loveing the detail. On the ship: The ""lid"" and eyes. The finished cockpit. Cozy interior... Would have had more room if it were the MAF though. The front landing gear. Simple and effective. The back landing gear. The rockets. The clips are annoying. But it make the rockets work so, I guess it was nessecary. Mounted on the bottom. Not very secure, but that's why they are meant to be dropped on the clones.... The finished ship. --------------------------------------------- Let me say that the droid gunship is a nice set indeed. Final rating: 86% Hope you enjoyed the review!

TheBrickster asked me a few weeks ago to do this, since he unfortunately never owned this great set, so here we go! First i have to say, that i really love this late 90's Town Theme, and i wish there would have been produced more sets. This is the only one i own, well, beside that i also still have 6572 Wind Runners, but the car is missing. Anyway, let's face the facts and let the pictures speak for themselves! Sub-Theme: X-Treme Team Set Nr.: 6584 Name: Extreme Team Challenge Number of minifigs: 4 Number of pieces: 354 Release Year: 1998 Let's start off with a few quick shots of the box & instructions: Inside of the box: We got some ideas for alternative models on the backside (the same ones are also on the backside of the instructions): Instructions: Here's an overall view of this huge set: We get 4 minifigs, each with different heads and color patterns, which i really like: ...and also a good amount of equipment for them: Let's move on with the cool vehicles, there are 3 (!) completely different ones in this set, first is the neat little trike: Next, the not less neat ""4-wheeled off-road-thing"" (don't know what's it called really ): And finally the huge Monster truck, i love the chrome sidepipes and the wench with the hook in the back, which adds a lot of playability: Oh, i almost forgot our brave adventurers also have got a raft to ride the wild mountain waters: Now let's focus on the many details of the mountain base. We got a bridge over troubled waters, but be aware, it's very unstable! Love the wood patterns on the yellow 1x6 tiles: On a corner a camera is mounted to document the wild life: For the evenings we also got a little campfire: Down by the river sits a grey falcon and watches the guys on their challenges: What's that? Seems not very safe, to be honest..be aware when you pass by these rocks.... ....cause it will collapse! Let's move up again where the tent is placed, inside is plenty of space to take a rest for the figs and to store their equipment: But i think they should have built the tent on another place cause the ground isn't very good there: When you pull the mechanism, a trap door opens: Will the guys all come back home safe and not injured? You decide! All in all this is a really great set, ome may say it is a bit juniorized because of the baseplate, but it really isn't. It's got a LOT of playability and some rare parts, the biggest beeing the baseplate which is only available in this set. I hope you liked my review, let me know your opinions!

More info: Bricklink - Peeron. I could have owned the 4910 Hover scout (see Metalandi's review here), but while I was buying some used sets, I forgot to buy that one too! So, here's my only RR set, the second smallest one (if we don't count Japanese promos; sweets are surely sweeter if they come with a Lego set!) Pieces: Face and torso closeup; I like the torso, the face is good except for the bandanna. Building is based on two big pieces: Landing Skids and Plate 6 x 6 x 2/3 Cross with Dome. Let's go! Building is over: Review: Pros: Small set (= cheap), 1 fig, two accessories, some interesting pieces like the rock and the Crystal. No stickers but 3 printed pieces! Good color choice. Cons: Tipper Bucket is fixed, no hinge. No levers or steering wheel, it probably moves by using the buttons on the 2x2 tile. It deserves a 4/5."

Nice review though. I never got into Rock Raiders. I would have loved the large drill bit piece for set #s 4970 and 4940. This set looks like a little boulder hawler, and a nice set to introduce someone unfamilar with the theme. I esp. like the fig and the little 2x2 drill bit tile.

Pizza to Go Review, is dedicated to Classic Town's opening cermony and members such as Hinckley, Brickster, ImperialShadows, Sinner and many others whom have contributed to the final success of Classic Town! Thank you so much for inviting me to be part of this wonderful project, and I wish all the best to the success of Classic Town! I urge everyone of you to check out Classic Town and take alook at the cool stuff we have done! *** Today, I will be doing up a review on Pizza To Go set. This outlet is one of the most favourite eatery for any LEGO citizens living in their town. When they are driving on the road, they are sure to look out ""PIZZERIA"" signage. They offer the best pizza in town. No one in town can resist the delicious aroma of Pizza, coming out from the red chimney. Let us find out why is this shop so popular among so many LEGO citizens and was one of the famous sets that is re-released under the ""LEGEND"" theme. Pizza To Go is my favourite set of all time. I believed there is no other pizza outlet lying around in any LEGO city apart Pizzeria. It seemed there are the sole outlet that is selling pizza for many years. This set was re-released in 2002 and it is part of the LEGEND theme. This is one of the few sets that are highly demanded to be brought back by many fans of LEGO around the world. I owned the 6350. Any members whom had owned both sets before? Is there any difference between these two? Because when I searched through Peeron, it shown 144 pieces instead of 194 pieces for the 1994 set. Name: Pizza To Go Theme: LEGO System / Town Year: 1994 (Re-release: 2002) Pieces: 194 Minifigs: 3 An image of a 6350, Pizza To Go Let the delivery begins! Pizza To Go is the regular pizza outlet that sells nothing but pizza. They deliever pizza to every household in town, with their trusty delivery van. Walk-in are welcomed too. There is a stand for customers to dine in their pizza quickly before making their way to their next destination. In my opnon, no town can ever survive without the Pizza Tradition! Devoted ""PIZZERIA"" staff Every outlet comes with 3 dedicated staff, making sure that operations will run smoothly. On the left, we will have the Pizza Boy, whom is wearing the regular blue dungarees and its white cap. I wonder who is that boy? On the middle, we will have the Pizza Girl. She looks like any typical sweet girl in town that the boys will look at. She is wearing a suntop strapless on her. She reminded me of one person though, I think her name is called Alice. Taking a careful look, I wonder if ImperialShadows is the Pizza Boy back then, without that black patch on its left eye? On another note, this mini-figure was my favourite. Female mini-figures are very uncommon back then. I am glad I have this figure, adding to my town population. On the right, we will have the hardworking chef, preparing the pizzas in the oven. He wears the regular white chef outfit, but he wear a grey pants instead of the usual full-white outfit in most resturants such as Breezeway Cafe (6376). Let's take a closer look at the Pizza Boy's van! This van is very very small looking and very fuel efficient. It is able to cut lanes very fast due to its small size. The pizza van is made up of 4-studs wide design. No doors by the side. However, in this vehicle, I think the doors is not a must to be included in this design. Our Pizza Boy will need to leave vehicle pretty fast, and ensuring that the pizza delivery is on time. Common mechanism This van has the regular rooftop that can be lifted up to place the Pizza Boy into the driver seat. There is a sun roof on its top, which enable him to let him have some sunlight from above! The logo on the side of it, is actually a transparent sticker, which have the PIZZERIA itallian logo and a tasty looking pizza on both sides of its van. I like that sticker very much. Mine looks quite worn out over time. If its a printed piece, It will be a terrific bonus. Nevertheless, I can still accept the sticker. Our pizza van can deliever up to 2 pizza at a go! At every trip, 2 piping hot pizza will be stored at the back of the van. The pizza is fitted in perfectly in each compartment. Furthermore, the white window shutter, is terrific in this design. You don't see this kind of design anymore. I think, I have not seen much delivery vans on the street anymore too. Base of the van From the base, you can see that it is using of the regular red car base that is common in most 4-studs vehicle design. In fact, this car base served as a foundation for its vehicle design. Back of PIZZERIA Alice and the Chef will be showing you around at the back of the kitchen. There is an oven on the left, a water tap and a holder for the oar stick. Looks pretty empty right? Look below for a surprise! My favourite feature! This oven can be used to heat up 2 pizzas at a go. Now, I understand why, this set is named ""Pizza To Go"". I have been using their slogan unknowingly. This feature is superb nice. Now, we know that the pizza is prepared from the outlet instead of using delivery van to collect it from a factory. Alice, what are you waiting for? Help the Chef quickly! PIZZERIA! The signage sure looks big from far and catches their attention easily too with its pleasnt looking design. As you have already noticed, this is made up of sticker. I don't mind, for this set, it contains sticker. Sometimes, I do hope they can give us spare sticker for us to change, after a long period of time. Distinct red chimney This is the front of the oven, and that is where the smoke comes out. Using only bricks to construct this, is simply wonderful. I like the use of their white bricks to construct the wall layout, and a combination of red parts, especially on the top. I like the look of this very much. Another picture on its side Printed parts In this set, you will get a total of 5 pizzas! And, I believed no other sets offer so many pizza. You can placed up to 4 pizzas in the van and oven. Alice will be carrying the last pizza around. The green and red round dish is a printed part. Most Exclusive part in 6350/10036 The most unique and important printed parts that is only exclusive in this set. It's at the front of the Pizza van. It is none other, but the Pizzeria logo, standing at the front of the delivery van. (Forgotten to take a picture of this piece, took it from Peeron.) Different views of Pizza To Go outlet Another bright sunday day in Pizza To Go! Summary review Playability: 10/10 (A lot of playing by doing up the pizza process. From preparing to delivery) Design: 9.5/10 (Outstanding design, with great use of bricks. I like the structure of it very much) Price: 9.5/10 (An inexpensive set based on the 1994 pricing. It comes with 3 mini-figs, shop, a van, and a exclusive printed piece) Overall: 9.7/10 (I am not trying to be bias. In fact, this set is absoultely filled with minimum flaws. Look at my review again, if you are not satisfied with it, or tell me what you don't like!) I gave it a ""5"" based on my Review Score Card. What about yours? Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. Comments and Critics are strongly welcomed. Pictures can be found in My Brickshelf(When moderated)"

For the review, I just have to point out a few things, to give you constructive criticism: first of all, it's chef, not ""chief"" (entirely different professions), and secondly, the scale you give in the poll isn't very even. ""Above average"" jumps to ""outstanding"", which is a too big of a gap in my opinion. You should've used ""Good"" or ""Great"" in between them.

But these are only minor faults, this is a good review anyway! Sandy, I appericate your constructive comments in order to improve the quality of my review. I had amended the word ""chief"" to ""chef"". You might want to check it. I did not notice that I was using the wrong word. As for the poll definitions which have been used, for 1 to 5. We used ""Poor"" to represent value ""1"" while ""Outstanding"" to represent value ""5"". We need to use clear definitions to illustrate and demostrate non-bias towards the review for the readers to cast their vote depending on their individual liking. Therefore, we used a common word which is known as ""Average"". In surveys, for measuring its sample size's liking, we have to use words which is neutral such as Strongly agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree, Strongly disagree. That's why, we used this rating approach to represent the terms. The Cobra, on Aug 24 2008, 07:37 PM, said: I rate it a full 5 too. And I wish Lego would make a set like this in 2010.

Well, Peeron can sometimes be not very accurate but it can served as a very useful guide in most areas."

The classic sets have a totally different feel to them than the newer sets. They look more human. Great review!

I remember I thought it was really awesome though. I thought the oven and pizza storage in the back of the car were the greatest parts, the little sink on the inside was cool too. Didn't realise they had made a Legends set out of it... I'd love to own this set again, but MISB examples on Bricklink go for an extortionate amount of money. Ah well, se la vie..."

I almost ordered this set back when it was re-released by Lego, but passed on it. I'm so mad at myself! This has all the terrific qualities that Classic Town sets exemplify. I love the delivery truck and the pizza oven. A great review from one of the ""Master EB Reviewers"" - outstanding! Hope you managed to find a good deal in the Internet.

Today, i'm gonna review the biggest set of the RES-Q Subtheme, 6479 Emergency Response Center. With this one i think, the reviews of all the RES-Q sets are complete now, and while i'm in a reviewing mode right now i thought i'd bring that up. This set hast got many nice aspects and also some very rare pieces, and comes with a wonderful amount of vehicles, including a speedboat, a tow truck, a helicopter, and a trike which can pull a little boat. So sit down, get your popcorn and beer, we're off to stormy weather at the coast! Sub-Theme: RES-Q Set Nr.: 6479 Name: Emergency Response Center Number of minifigs: 5 Number of pieces: 420 Release Year: 1998 Unfortunately i don't have many of the boxes of my res-q sets anymore, so i'll start right off with the instructions this time: On the backside there is no alternate model as usual this time, but only a different shot of the whole set: Next, a general overview, sorry about the slightly bad picture quality on some pics this time: Originally this set has 5 minfigs (which all are really nice!), but the guy who drives the tow truck has been lost in the flood Here's a picture of the missing fig: Let's move on to the vehicles, we have something for the water, the ground and the air in this set, first the great tow truck: I love the mechanism with the hooks in the back: Next on, da Speedboat! At the rear, it's got a stretcher and a wench, which adds a lot of playability: If there's a a little accident near the coast, the trike comes to appearance: For more complicated stuff, we have a little helicopter (i broke the rotating piece at the top yesterday, ouch! : ) No space for a victim you say? Well, not really, but the helicopter also got a wench with a hook in the back: Now it comes to the station itself, at the docks a neat life belt sign is mounted (remember, at this time there weren't real ones as today): A little more right an equipment holder is placed, with various tools on the front... ...and fire fighter equip at the back: At the very front a little lighttower secures the shelter: I haven't quite found out what this thing is supposed to be, maybe somebody knows Another equipment holder, this time with all the stuff you need for diving: More equipment... ...and even MORE! We come to the hear piece of the station, the control room with lots of buttons and scrrens: Last but not least, a quick shot of all the accesoires and tools that you get, which really is an A-MA-ZING amount! This set might have a few junioriced pieces, as the big window in the front or the ""briedge"" on the roof, but that doesn't matter, because there is nearly one other set in which you get so much rare pieces and such an overwhelming amount of accesoires, so i can recommend that for everybody who is a pieces-fanatic. Not to forget the playability, the great figs and the, in my opinion very good color scheme. Once again thanks for taking the time reading and looking at my review, i hope you liked it.

I love the Res-Q theme in general. I think that tow truck is easily the highlight of this set and is probably the best such vehicle I've seen in any City set. The other vehicles are also great. The base itself is lacking though, as it basically consists of one room that doesn't even have side walls. It does include a cool 3x6 computer sticker and a vast array of minifig tools and equipment though. I have some plans to modify the building and make it larger but have never gotten around to doing it."

Hope you guys like it. And I would like to apologise for the bad quality pictures. Hope you guys don't mind. First I will start with the box art. Box art: I guess this is the first time that LEGO Star Wars sets use white and blue colour for their box. I like the new colour scheme, a nice blend though. Here's the front: The back: Not to waste space on the box LEGO do some advertisement to attract us to buy more sets. :grin:the more The side: At the top side there is this minifigs scale picture. It is great as we get to know the real size of a minifigs. Contents: The contents consist of a sticker sheet, instruction book, and 8 packet of bricks. The packer are not numbered. But it is ok as there is not much pieces. Instruction book and random page: As usual the instruction book have brick checklist, other sets pictures, and tutorial on how you should assemble your set (I mean the very first page). Sticker sheet: There is not much sticker sheet and is a great news that the Republic logo on the round plate is printed unlike Republic Gunship. Anyway, I didn't apply the stickers. The Commander Gear: This is a new thing to minifigs as well. Well is like Batman accessories, they pack it in one small packet. However, you only get one commander gear pack in this set. Anyway, i didn't use them. The minifigs: Well, we get the the new minifigs. The ugly face clone, new printed torso and new mold of helmet. However i not really like the new head stud, i prefer a black one or at least the one like Jango Fett, black colour with face. The helmet: Everything is printed, no holes at the visor there, but there are hole on the both side. This new helmet mold also made the headgear turn 360 degree freely. Without helmet: With helmet: You can see the flesh tone at the hole beside. The blasters: @ short blasters were given instead of long one. Is great, at least they give us two blasters instead of one. The tank: Here is the pics of the tank. It was not badly design nor nicely design. But it looks great if you didn't saw the beneath or under the tank. View from front: View from side: View from back: What's beneath? Under it was 4 wheels, to make it move fluently. It is made by the thread supporter like the one we fet from TIE Crawler or Bat-Tank The functions: Well firstly, you can open up the hood (I guess) to see the engine. Secondly the side cannon that can move upwards. The thing is quite tight (see random instruction page) and there is barrier to block the cannon from going downwards. The cockpit: Well the cockpit is small and the space is limited. The monitor stuff is printed brick and is another great news. You have to remove the piece (pic below) to reveal the cockpit and put your clone to pilot it. Pop-up gunner mechanism: Well the backdoor have a thing to attack to the seat of the gunner. The top hatch is very loose. So it there is a clone as a gunner and you open the back door, the clone will pop-up and automatically open the hatch on top. This is how the top looks like without a clone. There is this movable cannon (upwards, left and right) and a little keyboard thing with it. But the cannon fall off quite easily. The flick launching missile mechanism: The mechanism is on both side and you need to turn the thing inwards to reveal the flick fire mechanism. Below are the pic of how it is turned. You can keep you blaster at the front of the side. There are place for you to store them. It close nicely. Completion: This is how it looks like. Extra parts: There quite a number of them. Overall: This set is not bad. The price is quite expensive but you will like it. The pop-up mechanism is something new (to me) but this set have more function and 2 Clone Trooper with a pack of Commander gear. Pros: -2x Clone Troopers -high playability -nice design Cons: -a little expensive -sticker sheet -cannon on top falls off quite easy Edited by KimT, 27 August 2008 - 12:16 PM."

In fact- here, have it. my all-time-favorite-LEGO-set: #1 useless information with high numbers: This set contains 1343 parts and was released in 1994 in the TECHNIC theme. The average price on Bricklink is 222,52USD or 488,78USD if you want it new. It weights 2625 grams and the box measures 52.5cm x 38cm x 9.5cm. Thank Bricklink for that information! #2 the box: Front: Back: Open: I don’t know many boxes that open like that: Just fold out the brackets and lift the top. #3 building instructions: They’re also special: You don’t need to search trough the 92 pages. Just flip the booklet and you can build the alternate model. Random page: “old-school-technic-style”. And a little bit difficult to follow. Note: compared with the 8880s building instructions, all the newer instructions are really juniorized. They even made a scheme with a 90° angle… There are some high-quality-pictures in the middle, where the two instructions meet. Also a very nice feature. This time I couldn’t make a #4 the parts: and #5 building: section. sorry. #6 functionality of the main model: steering, trunk, hidden headlamps: the mechanism for the steering (red) and the headlamps (green) V8-engine and suspension: four-wheel drive and four-wheel steering: 4 speed gear shift (?) no reverse: highly comfortable seats: #7 functionality of the alternate model: suspension: steering: 2 speed gear shift: V8-engine: for more information: visit technicopedia! #8 random shots of the main model: (feel free to ask for a 3264x2448px-version of this picture:) #9 random shots of the alternate model: (feel free to ask for a 3264x2448px-version of this picture:) #10 somewhat artistic shots: #11 high quality pictures from TLG: I scanned and edited them a little bit. 320px-pic here linked to a 1024px-pic on brickshelf. #12 final thoughts: I got this really-freaking-great set with 10 yearsand two others later from ebay - but I still know which of these three is the one from my childhood. It’s way(s) better than all the former supercars (even if some functions are missing), because it was the “first” technic set that combined size, functionality and appearance. (Okay, I don’t want to make exceptions here, because there are also other great sets. but I love this one! ) If you get a chance to get yourself a 8880, take it. build it. hug it. So. I'm calling it a day and just want to point out two things: take a look at My Massive Collection Of 8880s and my 8880 brickshelf folder, where I got a lot more photos than here (when public, of course) Thanks for reading/watching and feel free to comment!"

So big, the biggest Legoset upto that date... Only a year ago I managed to find it second hand on the internet for 50 euro's including the instructions but with some yellowing on most of the white pieces. The functions are really cool to watch, the only thing that slightly dissapointed me was the fact that the steering is quite stiff to operate and so is driving the car around in first gear. But that all comes down to the hugeness of the vehicle: I don't think I own a bigger set (in dimensions that is). Everything is cleverly worked out and there are some pieces that only appear in this set, like the white part with the gearshifter in the middle and the grey half opened axles holding the wheels in place. I noticed the fact that Captain Green Hair has also placed a comment on this set: we talked about this car (remember Mr. Hair?) and you said that you could build this entire machine in a time of under two hours.... Now there's some bragging that needs serious evidence one day...! Thanks for this lovely review Bernd, I think I will vote outstanding!"

My other option is to build something very similar from parts, and I close to being able to do that at the moment. (I need more springs and universal joints.)

I got two copies some time in 2001 from ebay, one of which is built. It's certainly my favorite among the 6 or 7 super car sets and is by far the most mechanically complex one, unless you count the 4x4 Off Roader. I made a few slight changes to mine, making the rear steering turn as far as the front one (not entirely realistic but it corners better that way and is easier to drive around the house ) and removing the suspension ""stoppers"" that prevent the wheels from going all the way down (which just add a lot of friction to the axles). I may also try replacing the dark gray shocks with the looser black ones at some point. The suspension on this model somehow feels too stiff and jerky compared to the older 8865, which had very smooth suspension. Another interesting project would be to try motorizing this model. I remember seeing some attempts at this many years ago, but the old motors back then couldn't move the car. The PF XL motor and the black/red 9V one are much more powerful though. Quote Back to the set, this is LEGOs finest hour and by a wide margin my favourite set. This is the pinnacle of system Technic, and it probably will never be matched. I still do hope that TLG will bring out a re-design using lift arms, but I suspect that the Ferrari license prevents them. The only feature this car is missing is a reverse gear, and I prefer the 4 wheel steering over that. Check this out. It's hard to make out a lot in the pictures but it looks like this may be the next true supercar, with a full set of mechanical functions unlike the Ferraris."

Before I tried to take out the gear box I decided on ""giving up"". Do you like the suspension of the 4x4 Off Roader better? That set actually has the opposite problem, with the suspension being too weak and not properly supporting the weight of the model, especially in the front. I added four additional shocks on mine and it works better now. For motorizing it, I think you would need to find some way to bypass that chain, which doesn't transmit torque very well. The chain goes around the steering axle though, so it could be a little tricky to put a geartrain through there."

Otherwise I would just take two motors and attach one to the front and one to the back differential. I think you are right. The car was designed to be pushed and to have the wheels driving the engine, not vice versa. So I suppose that if you really wanted to motorize it, you'd put a motor at one or more of the wheels. The wheel speed would stay constant, but as you went through the gears the motor would change speed. The car would not actually drive, you would have to lift the wheels off the ground like the motor option on the 8448. If you were really designing a motorized LEGO car, you would optimize the gear system for the speed and power of the motor. Once you use a gearbox, you are guaranteed to have the motor either over or under driven bin some gears. 8448 got around this by lifting the wheels off the ground when motorized to remove most of the load from the motor. That way you can watch the wheels change speed but there is not much resistance. They really go fast in 5th gear!! I once saw pictures of two 8880 sets, one of which was built in red and the other in yellow. Here's a yellowone."

My first try: 2 motors connected with a differential - to the axle which conects engine and gear box - instead of the seats and the second one: 2 motors: one to the front and one to the back differential. but a vertical technic brick blocked my quick attempt. (I tried to change the 2x3Brick and the 1x1Technic Brick which holds the 6L axle so that a I can drive the differential from the very front - there's enough space.) EDIT: spelling, of course.

Its a darn shame that it can't be extended. However, I see no reason why LEGO couldn't produce a special middle hull piece that is compatible. Although the way they've made the hull is a bit stupid. The old system was a lot more flexible. Better still why can't LEGO design a hull that can be extended in length and width... Then they could be as made as long or wide as desired and that would be great!"

The whole Gallery of box, parts, minifigs and finished model is here, over 2 pages. So on with the Show. Minifigs http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1340864 In the set you get Krakaroff (I dunno how to spell it) and Victor Krum. The figs are exactly the same, bar their heads. These are two fantastic figures, the expression on Krakaroff's face is priceless. Judging by the design I think we might get a Yellow Krakaroff cropping up somewhere, which would make me a happy bunny (he'd make a fantastic Viking) Ideally I'd have liked more than 2 figures for my money, three would have done it, I think 2 is too few. Piece Count http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344573 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344571 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344572 For a ?40 set, the piece count is quiet good, I don't know the exact number but when building it, I didn't feel short changed, bar the exception of the hull. Now I don't HATE the hull, my problem is that is doesn't connect with bricks like the old Pirate ships. There are pros and cons to this, on the plus side its more secure, and your whole ship doesn't need to be taken up with support structure. The negative side being, you can't really make it bigger (as they've only released a megablocking 4+ set with the right piece, and its the wrong color). I also like how its wide, meaning you can fit LOADS of minifigs on the main deck. Overall though I liked the pieces. Of note are gold studs (http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344510) (5 in total, you get one spare), the return of the black falcon shields (http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1340835) and the new Drumstrang Shields. The Construction A simple fun build. Nothing too fiddly. The Finished Model http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344474 (Big Picture) I really like this set. There's no bones about it. It seems Lego with the latter half of 2005 have given people who loved their original pirate ships hope for the future with this and the fantastic Viking Longboat. Even with the two 4+ pieces (the hull, and front of the ship) I wasn't put off. http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1340841 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344461 The front of the ship is a nice piece, and can be used for stuff like castles. http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344490 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344491 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344492 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344494 And the hull isn't all bad. What I REALLY liked was the little cargo hold, at the moment I have a treasure chest in there, but there' space for about eight of them I reckon. Playability wise it does make alot of sense, and as you can see you can imprision minifigs below deck. http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344484 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344488 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344506 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344500 The quarters are great as well. You can comfortably fit about six minifigs in the main gally, three by the steering wheel, and a couple up above the top cabin. You could fit more, but it'd look strange. My only gripe is the design of the top cabin. When you want to open it up, you have to remove the mast. I know its simple enough, but I think that it wouldn't have taken much for TLC to design it better. But saying that its easily done, and I like how the cabin can be lifted with ease from the steering deck. http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344540 The final play feature is the plank. You can while away the hours murdering hapless minifigs who've displeased the cabin. A really nice addition for pirate fans. The Final Verdict[/b Playability: 9.5/10 - Lots to do for all the kids. Piece Count: 9/10- A great selection, loses one for the hull. Figures: 8/10 - Just needs one more! Construction: 9/10 - Nice and simple. Value: 8.5/10 - Let down a bit by lack of minifigs, and the cons of the hull. [b]Overall: 8.8/10 Overall this is a set worth getting, especially if you miss proper pirates. It wouldn't take much to turn this into an AMAZING pirate ship MOC. Hope you liked my review. Matt"

It follow with a similar build to the 2007 trucks, but has a few improvements. Of course, the name of the set could have been a bit more creative... And yes, this was an academy review. Set name: Truck and Forklift Number: 7733 Pieces: 343 Theme: City Year Released: 2008 Price: $25.00 USD, ?19.99 GBP, 24.00 Euro 1/Box Now the box follows a design similar to most other City sets. It has the set information and photo of the set on the front, (sorry for it getting cut off, I will remake it). Now the back of the box shows what each bag builds. Bag 1 is for the forklift, bag 2 is for the cab, and bags 3 and 4 are for the containers. It also has the set's features. 2/Contents The instructions: There are 2 books included with the set: One for the forklift, and one for the truck. Minifigure(1) The first minifig you build is a simple cargo worker. Interesting/new parts: Here we have some interesting and new parts. They include a yellow seat, a 1x2 plate with clips, and a 1x4 slope. 3/The build Cargo1 The first cargo palette has a few crates on it. I really like the sticker on the small box. Forklift: The forklift is a very fun extra to build, and it is probably the best forklift that we have had so far. It is very realistic and is very strong. Cargo2 The next piece of cargo is some Octan barrels on a meter. I am not sure what It is supposed to be, but it is still a nice addition to the set. Minifgure(2) The second minifigure is a classic driver with sunglasses and a coffee mug. Very nice. New piece! This is a very nice new piece that is included in the set, a hollow canopy. I believe it is also in White with the police mobile command station. Truck: Now anyone who has had one of the Lego City Harbor sets from last year, then you will probably find this build to be very similar. Mostly in the cab part of the truck. The trucks build is very solid, and very realistic. I sense ths will bring the ratings up quite a bit. Mystery Cargo: For some time specualtion has been going around, what exactly is this? It seems like nuero poison.. I am very happy with those 2x2 cylinders in trans-yellow. In fact, you can join in and guess what it may be in this topic. Containers: The first container is built to hold one palette. It fits onto the truck. It produces a very pleasing result, and has a better look to it than the Containers from last year had. The second container has the ability to hold two palettes, and has a design similar to the first. Then, you build on the wheels. The back ones have beautiful mudflaps! Finshed set: ---------------------------------- Parts: 10/10 (lots of useful pieces, great colors, and some very cool new pieces.) Minifigs: 8/10 (I would have liked another but it was $25, so I guess its okay.) Price per part: 10/10 (almost 350 pieces for $25. ) Playability: 8/10 (Forklifts are always fun, and there are lots of things to do with this set.) Overall: 36/40 90% A- This is truley an outstanding set, and It will make a great addition to anyones collection. Mocers would aslo like this, due to the fact that it has some really nice parts. It has a great build, and utilizes some awesome new techniques. It also has details, something you might look for in a set. Highly Recommended. Hope everyone enjoyed the review! If you have any pic requests, questions, etc., please ask! I look forward to hearing your comments, and the judges comments as well. 7733 Peeron.com 7733 Bricklink Catalog 7733 Shop At Home"

So Enjoy! Set Name: Mini Forklift Number: 8290 Theme: Technic Parts: 89 Price: $10.99 1/Box The box for this set is suprisingly small. It's about the size of a $3.99 set. It shows the Main Forklift, and the set information. The back of the box features the Dragster. A very cool model, and the suspension works perfectly. 2/Contents We have two instruction booklets; One for the Forklift and one for the Dragster. The bags: Here are a few interesting pieces: The long double pin in blue, a bionicle connecter joint, and a yellow L joint. 3/Build We start off build nice and solid, with your average technic build: The following steps build up the detail of the bottom part. Next comes the cab. It's pretty simple yet effective. After that comes the Forks. They work very well, but If you have the palatte on them, and you let go, it might topple off. Hint: Put the edge of the palatte on the small lip on the pieces that connect to the forks. This will hold it on better. The finished Product and palatte: Extra Pieces(keep them, as they are used to build the alternate model): Here is something that I found- how to put a minifigure into the cab. First, remove the side doors. Then, set the fig into the cab, with his arm sticking slightly out the gap. And finaly, seal off the cab. A nice way to put system into technic for your towns. ---------------------------- Parts: 9/10(Loving them all.) Price per part ratio: 8/10(Somewhat Pleaseing) Playability: 9/10: Works in any system town, and has a great dragster alternate model.

Theme: Space, Blacktron I Set Name: Alienator Set Number: 6876 Number of Pieces: 82 Figures:1 Released: 1988 List Price: £?.99 (It seem no source online has the price) Peeron.com Bricklink.com As always lets have a look at the box first as I?€™m luck to own a boxed version of this set. Walking across a planet with a grid pattern sky! The back shows a great selection of alternative models. After opening the box we find a single instruction booklet Inside the instruction booklet Now we come to the man in the black visor the Mark I Blacktron and black and industrial he look. In my opinion I think he probably has the second best Lego Space torso. Before the focus group decided they needed to be brighter Now turning to the walker itself, it?€™s a simple build which I don?€™t think even I with my great skills for messing up could get wrong. The final unit is built in three key parts. The command pod which is attached to the body by two pins at the back. The walker legs, this is pure design genius. Simply built easy to replicate and no fancy parts. The top section which open to reveal the Blacktrons high-tech tools. Time to put the entire set together, I think you?€™ll agree it looks great for such a simple build. Looking like you could take on the universe. A side view of the finished product. A frontal view of the Alienator What the hell! How did that take down an AT-AT. This is one of my all time favourite Lego Space sets. Actually I didn?€™t have it pre-dark age and only recently bought one. What attracted me to it was an old boxed set, but since then I?€™ve discovered a set that I wished I?€™d owned long ago. The Rating System Figures: 8/10 (I love the dark industrial space look) Parts 7/10 (Yes it may be nearly all black with some yellow highlights, but is have a good range and they fit to make several great models.) Fun Fun Fun 8/10 (It walks well and it?€™s a great set, it has a large number of possible mods.) Design 10/10 (It?€™s ingenious the walking mechanism is so simple and yet so good I can?€™t fault it Price ?/10 (While I could tell you how much I paid I was luck on ebay so this remains a question mark) Grand Total 33/40 (Reduced top level due to lack of price knowledge) Conclusion. A set which in my opinion showcases what Lego was about in the 1980?€™s. The set has an excellent design ethic and looks great, with very limited parts it retains great action and functionality. Twinned with the great main model you?€™re shown that there are a number of other great models you can make with the same parts. This set is what it?€™s all about for me, I?€™m very glad I bought outside my normal theme when I saw this. Actually on the strength of this set I recently order 6894 Blacktron Invader and can?€™t wait to get it and see if it lives up to the Alienator."

One of the more interesting parts is the assembly of the engine, which if like me you don’t pay enough attention to the instructions when building you can end up getting wrong. The key detail I got wrong. Just before fitting the last engine. If we look carefully on the side we can see a missile launcher. I didn’t think torpedoes or concussion missiles were fired from there but I may be wrong. After fitting the engine the models looks like this. In all it’s glory. Manning one of the Alliance’s fighters. Not so ready to take on the empire was he? So overall we have a well designed model, which is in my opinion far superior to the original we were offered with Darth Vader way back when Lego Star Wars was new. This Y-wing is sleek and looks great in my opinion, the firing missiles are also a great touch. The Rating System Figures: 5/10 (for the same price the last X-wing had far more figures) Parts 6/10 Swooshability 9.5/10 Design 9/10 Price 3/10 Grand Total 32.5/50 Not to shabby. Conclusion. So finally the answers to the questions you’ve no doubt want to know is the set worth the price. I’ll be frank £39.99 is too much for this set. Despite this I currently have a squadron of three Y-wings, the reasons is this set has been on sale a number of times at £30 it’s certainly worth the money. Lego recently placed them online with a price of £20, this I think was a great price for the set and well work picking one or more up if you wanted to start your own rebellion."

But I don't like it that there is no landing gear. When you set this one on the floor/ your rebel base it looks like it crashed or something and looses its look of superiority actually quite fast. It needs to be at least 2 studs high, if not more, from the ground. TLC is in these days afraid of flimsy landing gear, as they gave to us in the early SW time. Now they want something sturdy for playability. But I think there should have been some details on the bottom, especially a landing gear that unfolds. I also don't like the mistake of TLC (that they changed this year with the release of Indy hopefully) to give the pilot a usual smile face. The old yellow version of Gold Leader even had a headgear. I hope TLC realised this year that we want more detailed faces. Well, the licenced sets we got proved that, but who knows. The upsides of this set are the amount of pieces and detail, especially the engines were fun to build and perhaps the most interesting construction I have seen in years. Also it is big, bulky and looks sleek at the same time, just wonderful. And next to the 4502 X-Wing it looks in the perfect size! I gave this the highest rating, even if the underside disappoints. But whatever, it is lego, you can add some landing gear on your own! Thanks for the review, your pics were really really good, next time make more of them please!"

It came from the east (Denmark) the set which had been foretold the cheap army builder and there was much rejoicing amongst the castle fans. The Cardinal then asked was all the rejoicing justified….. Set Name: The Knight Set Number: 5615 Number of Pieces: 21 Figures:1 Released: 2008 List Price: £2.00 Lets us begin with the box. The front shows us are knight and his rack of arms. The back shows us two sets from the Castle range. Moving inside the box now. The contents of the box, it doesn’t look like much. The instructions to help you through the build. Now the reason you probably bought the set, well at least why I did the Knight. This features the new torso for 2008 and is the height of fashion. This brings the number of printed torsos from the Crown Knights to three, which allows for a greater variety in building your armies. A new fashion sensation and all the must have accessories for this season. With a more heavily armoured look he’s ready for anything. The rest of the set is a weapons rack, I assume that once you’ve got a few of these set you’ll probably like me give up building them and part them out. But anyway here are some pictures of what the rest of the elements are spent on. A long and complex build begins. After 360 hour finally it’s finished sadly five minfigs were hurt in the construction of this rack. Now the money shot, where we can see it all come together. It looks great even the rack doesn’t look to bad. Sadly are hero wasn’t ready for other themes just yet. In total we have a good army builder which castle fans have wanted. However there remains a question in my mind as to if this set is good enough on it’s own. Without any other castle sets I can’t see it being to much fun so it’s not a good present. The Rating System Figures: 9/10 (Great new fashion for this season ) Parts 8/10 (Shield, sword, spear, helmet and armour what more could I want? Well two shields.) Fun Fun Fun 3/10 (Sadly it’s rather dull on it’s own I can’t think or to much else to do.) Design 7/10 (Yes it’s the army builder I’ve wanted design, well apart from that Pirate one.) Price 9/10 (At £2.00 what more can I say.) Grand Total 36/50 (Let down by being to small to stand alone..) Conclusion. So let’s answer the question, is it the army all castle fans have wanted? Well yes and no is the answer. While it is a great set and at the now reduced UK price of £2.00 amazing value. I still think it’s inferior compared with the army building capability of Cross Bow attack, I much prefer army building both factions at once."

The back just has more of the same not to inspiring. Once we open the box we find two poly bags and some instructions The total contents of the box, well minus the air Instruction booklet short and simple. Now the single minfig of the set, nothing new of special that I can see. …got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company. Moving onto the digger itself, it’s one of those builds where all you really need is a quick glance at the instructions and off you go. Side view of the finished product. Alternative view, it doesn’t look to bad. Now lets add our construction worker. Looks rather good, though the lifting action isn’t smooth. It’s nothing special, it’s not the greatest construction set that Lego have ever produced but I think it is worth the money. The arm action really does bug me though. The Rating System Figures: 5/10 (Just another construction peon.) Parts 4/10 (Nothing novel and I dislike the new digger arm system.) Fun Fun Fun 7/10 (I think the playability is high and you can get a good load of bricks in the bucket.) Design 6/10 (Not the best designed digger but not the worst.) Price 7/10 (A reasonable price for what you get) Grand Total 29/50 Still halfway decent but nothing to write home about Conclusion. This set is yet another in a long line of Lego digger and to be honest it’s not the best in my opinion. I still hold nostalgic memories for 6504 which I still think is a great digger. From my point of view the set sits to high off the ground and make me wonder how the worker gets in. I really don’t like the digging arm action it will never be smooth and while it poses better I just think it’s inferior. Despite this I still think it’s not a bad set, I’d just like it to be so much more."

It brings back some flashbacks of Supernova. Good times. Anyways, I recieved this set at christmas last year, with 3 other EF sets. Set name: Assault Tiger Number: 8113 Pieces: 163 Theme: Exo-force Year Released: 2008 Price: 15.00 USD, 18.95 EUR 1/Box The boxes this year are much different than those from previous years. It has some gaps in it, and has a cardboard backround inside of it. The box itself shows Assault tiger and the set information. The back shows a combiner. The cardboard backdrop: A very nice jungle look to it. It has lots of fog as well, creating a pale effect. 2/Contents The instructions: The instructions are clear, and straight-forward. Also included is a lego ""blooper."" The remains of the sticker sheet: The stickers aren't too bad. I didn't apply the saw sticker as I wanted it to be left plain. The buzzsaw: A VERY cool piece. Mocists will love this. 3/Build The figures: The figures included are Takeshi, who features a nice new torso. Also included is the mini robot. His is a very neat little guy, but sadly, he doesn't really become a weapon. More of a block of red and black bricks. The torso: Now the torso design for Assault tiger is very different from the past years. It now uses a castle-like piece as the main structure. Also of note is that he has a mini throne. No controls, sadly. And with the orange cockpit piece, it's impossible to see takeshi when looking at the AT close on. See the third pic. The legs: The legs are slightly similar to the MT-201 Ultra drill walker's, but have been modified to fit the AT. They are quite large, and suit their purpose. The arms: The arms follow a new design, but the only problem is, they have no elbow or hand articulation. Nice weapons though. The finished product: ----------------------- Parts: 10/10 (lots of useful pieces, great colors, and some very cool new pieces.) Minifigs: 8/10 (A robot would have been nice, and a better weapon mode for the mini-robot would have been good.) Price per part: 7/10 (A stretch...) Playability: 8/10 (The lack of elbow and wrist articulation isn't the greatest. Overall: 33/40 82.5% B- Assault tiger is a nice set, but some of those small little things can truly take a toll on the final rating. I think that I would only recommend this set to anyone who wants the yellow, and hardcore Exo-force fans.

This set is one of the few Exo-Force sets I haven't built myself yet, but I will get it on sale, guess soon. I'm do not like the use of Slizer-style ball-joints in Exo-Force, even though they are modified to 2x2 bricks. In this particular set I think the arms look weak, and they lack elbow joint like the ""green 2008 mech"" set. (forgot name of this years green mech). Quite a shame, I find it really hurts the functionality of that ""green"" set and could imagine the same with the ""Tiger"". I guess with the new pyramide brick as cockpit, the cockpit is still open from the sides and the back. I modified my ""green 2008 mech"", which use the same cockpit design, with a few green bricks, and it is now completely closed from all sides. I rate the Tiger at average, but I may change my mind when I get to build it myself. Front"

How are you going to manage that? Well here’s the answer. Theme: Castle Set Name: Troll Warrior Set Number: 5618 Number of Pieces: 19 Figures:1 Released: 2008 List Price: £2.50 (GBP) $3.50 (USD) 2.99 (EURO) 5618 Peeron.com 5618 Bricklink Catalog 5618 Shop At Home Lets us begin with the box. The troll warrior and his might cart. Set sets for children to pester for at Christmas. Now for what’s inside. The contents of the box, it doesn’t look like much. Now for the troll himself, I’m glad they selected this troll torso rather than the other one for the impulse set I think this one is the superior one. Also he comes well armed with a spear and sword but no shield sadly. Someone really needs to look at the rodent problem in the Castle sets.. Now the cart, nice easy construction as with all impulse sets, I’m still not convinced by the flicking missiles. A line of those would do some damage. What an oncoming army can expect to see.. All together now and it looks rather good. So there we have it a cheap way of bolstering the troll army and outfitting them with some more weapons. Also for anyone planning a Pied Piper MOC another set with a rat in it. The Rating System Figures: 8/10 (|Preferred troll torso and helmet style. ) Parts 7/10 (Two spears and a sword but sadly lacking that all important shield.) Fun Fun Fun 4/10 (Somewhat more to do on it’s own that other impulse at least the troll can fight the rat!) Design 7/10 (Well designed even the flicker missile doesn’t look bad) Price 8/10 (At £2.50 more than the other castle impulse.) Grand Total 34/50 (Lack of a shield and to small to stand alone for my rating system..) Conclusion. Castle fans got a great army builder with The Knight and they’ve been lucky enough to receive another one with this set. I’m glad we’ve got a troll impulse as it allow for enlarging the armies of evil some the Crown Knight don’t totally outnumber all their opponents."

Wheels are very useful, especially if you don't have any :) As for shields - I don't imagine trolls use them too much. I think that they fight berserk style - all out assault. One complaint is the piece that the wheels are attached to - its a single piece, with smaller than the standard pin connection. So you cant change the width of the cart for your MOCs using the wheels. I don't know if a piece with such a connection only on one side exists though ...."

The cart is a nicely formidable machine that I will keep together so I can maximise their fire power.

The Knight impulse set #5615 offers more in my opinion since it gives two helmets, two weapons, a shield and an armor piece along with the weapon rack. I'm not a fan in the slightest of flickfire missles and projectiles like on the cart, and the previously mentioned one piece axle limits the wheel usage in other MOCs. I would've liked to see an added chest armor piece at the very least and a shield would've made this great. Those things are so rare and it would've bumped the piece count up to 21 to match the Knight set. Since both are showing the same price on S@H(in US dollars at least), it would've made sense."

Interestingly an action shot and not other sets you might like to buy. The contents of the box. Looks much like every other impulse set. Firefighter, not sure there’s much else to say apart from I wish they’d included breathing equipment. Looking pretty pleased with himself if you ask me. The equipment rack is fairly standard and easy to build, it does however include a fire hydrant. Inbuild shot, will I be able to finish this complex build.[/. Unsurprisingly I did. I nice selection of kit is provided. All together, I think the fire is a bit odd but it does add playability.

This isn’t a set I’d necessarily buy, but while I was at Bluewater today I decided I should try to review every impulse set myself, so that why I bought it. Still I think it has some good playability and a good set of accessories if you need more firefighting kit, I just can’t get passed the lack of breaking apparatus, that would have made it a better set in my view."

Space man approaching the robot from behind. I?€™m not sure you can still buy the base easily anymore. The contents of the box. The contents of the box, it?€™s rather white. Fairly standard Mission Mars spaceman, he?€™s got printing front and back but sadly no air tank! How does he breath? *As has been pointed out he does have a printed tank but I'd rather a physical one* Note the megaphone is in flashlight mode not weapon mode, that?€™s important.. The robot itself feels a bit clumsy the metal detector is never going to touch the ground and it feel a bit wide. I don?€™t like the look of him something in the eyes. The reason why so we can have a box to put crystals in. Both together and ready to explore new worlds etc. Sadly the robot was homicidal, remember in space no one can hear you scream. It?€™s not a bad impulse set and if it marks the return of brick built robots to Space then it?€™s a good thing. I just feel the robot could have been better built. The Rating System Figures: 6/10 (Not to bad but nothing wonderful) Parts 6/10 (Lots of white and not much orange, but where?€™s the air tank!)

A beautiful minfig, amazing minfigs, what more could you want? So was this set worth it? I guess you will just have to read the review to find out! Set name: The Batcycle: Harley Quinn's Hammer Truck Number: 7886 Pieces: 267 Theme: Batman Year: 2008 Price: 35.00 USD, 44.96 EURO 1/Box The new box art for batman is pretty stunning. It's clean, and really sells the set. For this set, Harley Quinn's truck is pictured attacking Batman, with the set information. The back of the box shows a nice little comic, the other sets, as well as the set functions. 2/Contents The instructions: The instructions for the set are, as always, clear and straightforward. They display the colors well, and have what we expect in an instruction book. 3/Build Minifigs: The stars of the set! Batman is back with a new torso, much more metalic than before. Harley had all new printed torso, legs, a new head, and that sweet new hat. Batcycle: The bottom part is very sturdy thanks to a small bit of Technic. The red throws it off a bit, but it isn't seen once the top part is put on. It has a nice use of the smoke stacks, and looks very nice in the end. The top part is simple, but suits the purpose well. It has handle bars, and a nice motor. The blue is a little strange though. Hammer Truck: The hammer truck begins with a very sturdy base. It has lots of detail, and really looks cool. Rims Added: Lego did a very nice job at giving it a checker board appearence. The only problem here is that you stick a sticker over two bricks, multiple times. Jewels: Inside of the crate are these shining jewels. Look how they illuminate the darkness in Gotham... More Added: Then, we add on a spoiler and the crate. Looking very nice now. The detail is again, outstanding, and It has a good amount of smoothness to it. The infamous Hammer! Okay, I haven't said this yet, but the square pieces need to stop. First on those SW backta tanks, now on the hammer? It creates a sloppy look for the hammer. Still, this is the ultimate wacking weapon. Added to the truck: On the truck it works pretty well. But the handle is to short, and it's near impossible to smash Batman. The finished truck: The finished truck is really nice. The big wheels give it the monster truck feel, and the way that Lego alternated the colors works well. The cockpit is a little palin, but that's not a major issue. The ""I love Joker"" sticker is one of the best stickers I've seen. It's simply a classic. The finished set: ---------------------------- Parts: 9/10 (Lot's of good mocing pieces, and red and black are always usefull.) Minifigs: 10/10 (Awesome!) Playability: 9/10 (the hammer is a little short) Price-per-part: 8/10 (It's a liscensed theme, so meh.) Set 7886 is a very nice set, and has some great details in it. The minifigs are very cool as well. However, their are some flaws. First, the hammer is two short, and is kind of square. The Batcycle has a few awkward colors in it, which throws it off a bit. This set is definatly worth the money. Batman fans will love it. And also wacking fans will like it, for that hammer... And if you would like to buy this set, Here are a few useful links: S@H link Peeron link Please let me know your comments. And pic requests and questions are welcome!"

First, the box shots The front shows a nice image of Indy on his horse, trying to make it on to the truck, and the attack truck taking aim. The back This side shows some of the features of the set, in little pictures on the left. Instruction manual Not much to say here, as it's the same picture as on the box. Inside the manual On one of the last pages we have a nice picture like the one on the back of the box, showing some features of the set. Random manual pic Here we have the nice piece call-outs that we have come to expect lately. The bags were numbered as well. The pieces A nice selection here, especially if you like black, dark bley and bley. ""Cool"" pieces The golden treasure chest has a really nice sparkle to it. The set also has a good assortment of coins and jewels, and some wonderful silver 1x1 dots. The canvas covering This is quite nice. It has a nice dark tan color, and some nice detail on it as well. The minifigs First comes Indy's beautiful white horse. I always like LEGO animals and this one is no exception. Here are the figs On the left Indiana Jones, and his nice stubble, printed legs, side bag and the best LEGO hat in history. And the Nazis, Peter, Hans, and Klaus. Their torsos are very nice and the hats are amazing. They look really nice with all of their tan. The extra parts Here you get two of the nice silver 1x1s, some clear 1x1s, and the usual technic pins and levers. Now the finished set! First we have the attack truck The truck looks very good. It looks very military like with the colors and the design. It is designed wonderfully with really nice mudguards and a well-detailed front. The only fault of this is I think the top part where the gunner stands is a bit bare. The front Here you can see the front, which has a nice smooth look with some nice details as well. The front ridged piece works well here. The gun This is well made. It is built by attaching a lightsaber hilt in a sort of videocamera piece. The actual area where the guy stands is pretty bare, but not too bad. Backside of the truck The spare tire here is a simple, but nice touch. A side view The mudguards are smartly built by clipping wing flaps on to handle plates. This part gets a bit tedious, but the end result is worth it. The big boy cargo truck! This is another really well built truck. It has a lot of the same design elements as in the smaller truck, such as the mudguards. Front view The front of this truck is as nice or better than the other truck. It uses good SNOT building, and everything fits in well. A close-up view of the tire area Just behind the tire you can see those silver 1x1s being used as the suspension. This is a really nice addition and it looks great. NOTE: It's only visual suspension. It is not supposed to work. The canvas cover in action Now the canvas attaches by putting the holes in the canvas, on some little blue technic pins and then clamping them down with the hinged pieces. It looks really nice and curves nicely. The windscreen Treasure! My favorite piece in action. I took this picture with the flash on, so you can see how it sparkles. I think we have waited far too long for this great piece. The complete set! Everything all together. Indy is chasing fast! Indy's got it! Brickshelf Folder Now, for the ratings! Price: 9/10 (Not bad, but could have slightly more pieces. At least it has 4 minifigs and that makes up for it.) Parts: 9/10 (A nice selection of parts, lots of greys and black.) Design: 10/10 (The trucks are really well-designed, the mudguards are excellent.) Playability: 8/10 ( I always like rolling the trucks across the floor. ) Build: 9/10 (Pretty good, but gets a bit repetitive in some parts.) Overall: 45/50 Brickset Bricklink Entry Peeron Lego S@H Even after intense fighting, everyone always gets along when there's food to be eaten... ""Hey Indy! Vant some mustard?"" ""How about some Ketchup?"" Summary This, and all of the other Indiana Jones sets are some of my favorites. They all have nice colors, good design, and great minifigs. Although I need Indy in a different outfit pretty soon. His outfit is starting to smell a bit ripe . This set in particular is very well designed, and I can't wait for some more Indy next year. Thanks, and happy building! Edited by Erdbeereis1, 29 August 2008 - 03:47 AM."

I finally just purchased the chest for myself. I suppose this is a testament to how well honed your picture taking skills are. This set is definitely a nice one. I'm not a LEGO Indy collector, but I was tempted to purchase this set several times. The vehicles are very nicely detailed and have some cool building techniques, such as the wheel guards."

When I first saw this set, I immiediately liked it.I think TLG should make more of these everyday life type sets such as delivering mail, going to the grocery store, things like that. Anyway, enough blabbering, on to the review! 7731 Mail Van Set Name: 7731 Mail Van Year: 2008 Theme: City Pieces: 66 Price: $7.99 pounds 4.99 Euros 5.95 Price Per Piece: About 12 cents We'll start with the box shots. The box is an interesting shape that I have never seen before. Very rectangular. The box art is pretty nice. The back shows the mailman delivering some mail. The picture on the front is the same as on the box. Random manual shot. The manual does not have the piece call outs, but on a small set like this, I don't feel it's needed. Parts list. Decent selection of parts. I really like the mail pieces. Image at the back of the manual showing all of the Cargo sets together in a little scene. I like it when the manuals have images like these because it's nice to see all of the sets together. All of the parts spread out. The parts in this set are pretty good. Unfortunatly the car base is one large piece, however, we do get 2 printed mail pieces which are always nice. Our trusty mailman. This torso I think is very nice. The little envelope is a nice touch. Extra parts. Not much to say here... The finished set! I really like the design of the van. It looks very smooth and somehow looks very LEGO to me. The colors are my favorite part. The red and yellow look nice together A nice mailbox. However I wish the letter on the front was printed. The front of the van is nice I think. The textured brick on the front gives it a different look on the front which is nice. The back of the van. The doors open to store mail, although it doesn't have much room, I like that they included this feature. Delivery! The mail bricks slide right into the hole at the front. This adds nice playability. The van's all loaded up! We are ready to deliver! ======================= Parts: 7/10 (Pretty good piece selection, but for $8, should have included a few more.) Playability:8/10 (It's fun to deliver the mail to all of your town's residents.) Design: 9/10 (The design is very nice, except I feel that some of the stickered parts could have been printed.) Overall: 24/30 After a long, hard day of delivering mail, there's nothing like enjoying a nice pizza and letting your hair out. Why do they make us wear those silly hats anyway... This is a nice set that I can definitely recommend and I think TLG should certainly release a post office to go with this and the Air Mail set. I really like these everyday life sets rather than always fighting crime or putting out fires. Those guys have normal lives too! Brickshelf folder: http://www.brickshel...ry.cgi?f=338718"

The sun is shining, the birds are singing, minifigs are drowning.... Wait? What?! The Coast Guard rushes to the scene and deploys the Coast Guard 4WD & Jet Scooter to save the poor minifig from drowning. Let's take a look at the Coast Guard's buggy! 7737 Coast Guard 4WD & Jet Scooter Set Info Set Name: 7737 Coast Guard 4WD & Jet Scooter Theme: City-Coast Guard Released: 2008 Price: 9.99 USD-9.95 EUR-7.99 GBP Pieces: 130 Minifigs: 1 Price Per Piece: About 8 cents Now, the review! The Box Here is the front. It shows a nice image of the buggy on the beach with the ocean in the background. The Back The back shows some of the features in the set, such as the extra equipment. Manual The picture on the manual is the same as on the box as usual. The Parts The set has great colors. I love how the orange, blue and white look together. The part selection is quite good, but unfortunately uses the large car base. Coast Guard Minifig This is a great fig. The torso print is very nice and matches the buggy's colors well. New Tire Mold Here are the new tires. They look very good. In-Manual Shot Color separation is not a problem here, and since it is a small set, the piece call out is not a necessity. Extra Parts It is always nice to get extra cheese slopes. The Finished Set! The design of the trailer and jetski is great. The jetski is very smooth looking and the color scheme is fantastic. The sticker on the roof is nice, but it's actually too big for the piece. The corners of the sticker flap where the piece curves. Jetski Close-up Here you can see how it attaches to the trailer. I didn't add the sticker that goes on the front which is a little sign that says BB-03 or something. Attaching The Trailer This is where the trailer connects to the main car. It attaches simply with a ball joint. Car Front View The license plate is a nice sticker, and the top lights look nice. Say cheese driver! The Back The back is very similar to the front, it has the same sticker. The Equipment Rack A very welcome addition to the set. It adds quite a bit of playability. The orange fins are great. All Decked Out He looks pretty spiffy in his diving suit doesn't he? Brickshelf Folder The Ratings! Price: 10/10 (You can't get much more in here for $10) Parts: 9/10 (Nice selection and great colors. The big car base is a bit annoying) Design: 9/10 (The jetski is a prime example of something with a small amount of pieces that still looks amazing) Playability: 9/10 (You can drive the car, go diving, and jetski across the bay) Minifig: 7/10 (The one it comes with is great, but it could have come with one more. Perhaps a citizen of some sort) Build: 8/10 (Simple, but looks great) Overall: 42/50 LEGO S@H Brickset Peeron Bricklink Even in the face of danger, this member of the Coast Guard always has a smile on his face... Summary Simply put, for $10 you have to buy this set. It is one of the better sets in this price range you can buy, and one of the best small city sets. The colors are great, the design is great, and the fig is great. I don't normally think small sets are worth heavy praise, but this one definitely deserves it. Thanks, and happy building!"

I was thinking of getting this set and having read your review went out today and got it. What a great little set. What I particularly like: Very sturdy build. Feels very solid as you build the pickup (compared to the Fire pickup & trailer I also have) The orange pieces (my first pieces in this colour!) The tyres which give the smoothest ride of any Lego Town/City vehicle I've ever built The raised suspension and side runners The Coast Guard dude (again a first for me) and his mega-cool flippers and aqualung The jetski controls - The handlebars actually move left to right which is a great detail Little details that Lego didn't have to do (the grey handle by the ball joint; moving handlebars; the new tyres) As you can probably guess, I have voted Outstanding for this set!

I just finished building mine yesterday, and I love it. But here is one suggestion. Trim the large sticker that goes on the roof of the vehicle by cutting along the angles at the front of the sticker. If you use it as it is, it will extend beyond the ""flat"" surface of the roof and will overlap the lower sections. Past experience with stickers has suggested that this sticker will ""lift"" at the front corners. Lego stickers are probably the best that there are, but sometimes modifications must be made.

Let's join the Pirates as they try to steal the sacred treasure from the Islanders' hands. It won't be easy, King Kahuka and his loyal warriors closely guard the treasure 24 hours a day. Will the Pirates with their trusty pistols and cutlasses be able to defeat the Islanders' spears, pet alligator and powerful leafy skirts? We will find out! 6262 King Kahuka's Throne Set Info Set Name: 6262 King Kahuka's Throne Theme: Pirates-Islanders Released: 1994 Price: ??? (I don't know the original price. I got it from Bricklink with no box for $17. Unfortunately, I was not able to locate the Euro or Pounds price.) Pieces: 123 Minifigs: 5 Off we go! Unfortunately, I don't have the box because I didn't like the idea of spending over $50 for a set with under 200 pieces. So sorry, no box pics. Instructions I think the image on the front is very good. It seems less setup somehow than the instructions these days. It looks more like someone snuck up on them while they were going about their duties and snapped away rather than something that was planned. The Parts A nice selection here. There is a pretty good amount of printed pieces in this set which is always nice. For example, the zebra print tile, as well as the pirate flag nowadays would almost certainly be stickered. The set also comes with a nice dark grey BURP and a red boat for the Pirates. The Minifigs The main buying point of this set for me were the minifigs. This set comes with 5 of them which is quite good for a small set like this, especially when compared to the sets of today. The set comes with 1 alligator, 2 Pirates, 2 Islander Warriors and King Kahuka himself. I really like the Islanders' torso and leg prints. The leafy skirts are a nice touch and the make-up on the faces is superb. Some Parts I Liked These shields have a nice design on them and I always like the treasure chests. A Picture Inside The Manual This is a feature that I liked in the manual, it shows an overhead view of the baseplate so it's much easier to find where to put the piece. I certainly could have used this feature in last year's Aquabase Invasion set. A Close-Up Of The King The face print is nice. I wonder who Kahuka's make-up artist is.... The finished set! First, The Pirates' Boat The boat is really nice. The sail is made out of a nice cloth, and connects simply to the mast. And now, the main part of the set, the throne! This is a really nice model. I think the colors and the design make it really feel like a different part of the LEGO world. The rock sculpture looks fantastic as well. The throne, which is sort of a stretcher thing attaches here. It connects on a 1x2 tile with a stud in the middle for easy removal Here is the treasure that the Pirates seek The treasure rests on tiles inside of the rock. The zebra print tribal drum This is simple but nice. One thing that's great about this which I mentioned earlier, is that this and all of the other pieces with designs on them are printed. That's right, no stickers to be found here! I have used these zebra-print tiles many times for MOCs, as they make a great exotic detail piece. The lovely rock head I think this is wonderful. It really adds a lot to the set. It is well built with grey slopes, curved pieces for the mouth and nose, headlight bricks for the eyes and feathers and horns for detail. The backside The complete set! Overall, this looks great in my opinion with great landscaping and some fun parts. Well, it looks like the Pirates walked all over the Islanders and stole their treasure... In fact, it looks like it was pretty brutal. Brickshelf Folder Now, for the the ratings! Price: 8/10 (for $17 not a great price per piece value. But when you add 5 figs in, it makes it a decent price. Plus this set hasn't been in stores for 14 years so that adds some cost) Parts: 9/10 (The set has some really nice printed parts, as well as a baseplate, which in my opinion, is great) Design: 9/10: (No flaws that I can think of right away. The rock face is very well built) Playability: 8/10 (Not really anything to play with, although you can sail the ship and steal the treasure) Build: 9/10 (Rock face uses nice techniques and the rest of the set is simple but looks good) Minifigs: 10/10 (The minifigs are just fantastic. Great prints, and just overall fun. Overall: 53/60 Bricklink Entry Peeron Brickset It looks like the Pirates have picked up a new recruit from the island... Summary The older LEGO sets have a really different look to them than the new sets, and I think it's nice to have a mix of new and old. This is definitely a great set with a nice build and great minifigs. Add to this the great printed pieces and that old Pirate charm, and you get a very nice set that I can certainly recommend. Thanks, and happy building! Edited by Erdbeereis, 17 August 2009 - 02:39 AM."

They are a nice change from the regular pirate versus soldiers that is the norm. I think it would be interesting to see some new Islanders sets released in the new pirate line to see how TLC would make them.

Fantastic job Erdbeereis1! This set is interesting for several reasons. First of all it contains a large amount of (very) useful minifigs. Not many sets of this size contain so much figs. Secondly, the throne itself can be easily combined with the other Islander sets or even with other pirate and non-pirate sets. I'm going to see if I can get this one for a reasonable price on eBay."

So here is another review from me. As usual, let us start off with the box art. Box art: I like the box art. They put a nice background for the AT-AP. At the side we have the minifigs scale and at the back there is the function shown and advertisement for other set. The content: The content is consist of 6 packets of bricks and a instruction book. Yeap, no sticker sheet. Instruction book: The instruction books not only show us the steps but also show us all a clear pictures of the January release sets and some sets show with their function. Well, this includes the AT-AP functions as well. Besides, there are bricks checklist as well and the how do you start off before assemble your sets and a little poster where the clones with their AT-AP battling the Droids. Here's a random page. New pieces (to me): I never see both of this piece before so I assume it is a new pieces. Anyone have any idea is there any other sets that contains this piece? The blasters: We are given a 2 long blasters which is great. Which I it is more accurate as most of the Clone troopers use a long blaster. The minifigs: The minifigs is 2 Shock Trooper but is different with #7655 clone troopers battle packs's Shock Trooper. The leg is different in colour, we are given white hip while the one in the battle pack are given a black hip. Furthermore, we get a new printed headgear, which I think they have improve it, check out the mouth printing, the colour is brighter. So here is the headgear: The headgear limit itself from turning to the side this is because the front part it is too low until it block by the torso. The Shock Troopers: Without helmet on: We are given a black stud, no face printed. How I wish that I have extra. With helmet on: Comparison with Shock Troopers from Battle Pack: The AT-AP: Here's the AT-AP. It looks ugly at a certain angle and looks great in a certain angle. Anyway I still like the set. I like the walker vehicle. Below are the pictures taken randomly: Top view: Side view: Without stabilizer leg: With stabilizer leg: Rear view: The Functions: Well, the functions are not so impressive. Just something turning around, open here and there. The only function that is say as special is the retractable stabilizer leg. The cockpit: The cockpit can fit two Clone Troopers but too bad we are only given two and is not enough as there is no gunner on top. Inside it there is a guns holders, which can hold two guns but fall off easily when you are trying to remove the guns. Well the other side have some speedometre thing and a controller. To reveal the cockpit, you have to open the top hatch. Look below: so you can see what's inside: Oops, the side hatch and back hatch as well: Open and close: I think this pieces is use not to let you open the hatch but to make some design, I mean make it able to move inside. With Clones: Beneath: So this is the pieces that hold the stabilizer leg when is not in use. This is how the stabilizer leg move: At last~ And of course the revealing cockpit from below and at the back. Guess the droids have alternative way to take this things down faster. The leg: There are pieces blocking the leg to go to the front I mean overhead and lose balance. The base in not movable The side armor: The side armor has door and this is how it is attach. It is very flimsy, when you want to adjust it to be a little steep to creat the shape, they might just fall off. So it is connected to the body with just a technic pin. and to hold it properly, here is the support: The side hatch: It open and close easily, very loose, nothing to hold it tight. Here's some view when the side hatch is open. The cannon: The cannon on top is movable and adjustable. The big cannon can move up and down while the smaller one can cove sideways. But the smaller one tend to lose balance when it is without minifigs, means the one on top and below will not b align. This is the pieces that only enable it to move up and down. To prevent it from moving freely, LEGO put two pieces to block it. Completion: I try to make the sets looks great. I think this angle is right. Spare parts: It is so few compare with #7673 Magna Guard Starfighter and it is more expensive. Overall: This set is not really a good set. The hatch is quite flimsy, top and the side since there is nothing to hold them tight. Besides, it is lack of one clone. But to complete your walker collection, you must have it. Pros: -no sticker needed -new improved headgear -long balsters Cons: -lack of clone -flimsy -expensive as few pieces are given] Hope you guys like it. Edited by KimT, 30 August 2008 - 12:01 PM."

It's used in 10 different sets so far, not exactly a new piece A nice review with many good comments. I really like this set. It's one of the walkers with really good design and a lot of playability. It's the usual issue of using too many technic pieces to make a moveable feature versus minifig-scaled design. The same issue concerns for example the AT-AT, The Twilight and the AT-TE (plus more sets). What annoys me in this set is the use of the 2 tan 4x8 plates. They ""stick out"" and it would have been better if they (the designers) had used dark grey or light grey plates. Also I'll add this to the inventory - now!"

I don't like the shock troopers helmets that much. I feel they should have printed visors instead of cut out ones like they have in my opinion it would make it look a lot better. The AT AP itself sounds like it has a lot of holes in its cockpit which drags the set down and make it seem like they haven't exactly put a lot of effort into it. Great review!

Quote Conquer the galaxy, one planet at a time! Unleash the power of the Separatist Spider Droid™! This towering engine of mechanical destruction from the Clone Wars strides across hostile terrain on four independently positionable stilt legs, then uses its movable laser cannons to blast Republic forces. Includes Commander Fox™, Clone Trooper™, Battle Droid™, Super Battle Droid™ and Battle Droid Commander™ minifigures! Rotate the laser cannon on top! Laser cannon underneath bends to change direction! Measures 6"" (15cm) tall and 10½"" (27cm) wide! Also known as the homing spider droid, this is what I would usually reckon as a mini-fig set if not for the high price point. Since there's a total of 5 mini-figs to be had, and at least 3 of them are going to be high sought after.(Commander Fox™, Clone Trooper™, Battle Droid Commander™). At first glance, it looked like there's only 3 packets. Actually, it's a total of 4 packets, 1 of the packet is inside the biggest packet. It's not a very complex build. Took me around 25min since I was playing around with the mini-figs more than I was building up the spider droid. Though finally, here's the completed build-up. Usually for lego products, what excites me are the vehicles, yet this set is the other way round. Yes, the mini-figs are definitely the crowd-pleaser this time. On with the review. Here's the close-ups of the droids in the following order, Battle Droid Commander™, Battle Droid™, & Super Battle Droid™. There's not much to comment on the droids, except that the battle droids come with the new arm that's able to hold the blaster properly upright. The SBD is the same dude that can be found easily in the previous droid battlepack. And now the good part... Clone troopers. And that's commander fox, and his trooper. I was quite mystified by the amount of accessories given to the clone troopers as per the instruction booklet, as there wasn't any indication of what they were... (commlink, grenades, sensor scope, range finder?!?) Then it hit me... real hard. Notice anything yet? Yup, it's a night scope, and a range finder. That, plus the visor that's available to Fox too. Now, this is really a good time to start troop building for the clone wars. :twisted: Here's the weaponary. Of course, let not forget the main dude... Fore: Port: Aft: Starboard: The SSD looks very similar to the actual screenshots from AOTC, though am still wondering what's that little translucent red piece for... A re-enactment. And a comparison. This set is really either a miss or a hit. For me, it's a hit, due to the mini-fig count, and the wide array of accessories. It's going to probably be a hit depending on the movie that's coming out this month, since we have commander fox here(I heard that C.Fox hasbro figure is a Target Exclusive, meaning it's gonna be another highly sought after). This set is also stated to be a limited edition, and seeing as how it's only available so far in only 1 toys r us in sg, this just might not be available anymore after the movie starts. :D Comments: This review was done immediately after the Launch of the clone wars toys at the midnight launch on 26 July on a local starwars fan forum. And after having caught the movie only yesterday, I now only have this to say, ""It's not part of the movie!?!"". Oh well, Cmdr. Fox probably will fair better once the TV series starts proper. Then again, that less-than-one-minute cameo of him, I do find it unforgivable. This being the 2nd review available, I sincerely hope you guys enjoy it."

He is a master of the wand and can see the future. With these abilities, he helps the knights predict where the Trolls will strike next. Because this set is not in stores in the U.S., I was luckily able to buy this set on my vacation to Germany. It is interesting that it is a Euro exclusive. 5614 The Good Wizard Set Info Set Name: 5614 The Good Wizard Theme: Castle Released: 2008 Price: EUR 2.95-GBP 1.99 Pieces: 16 Minifigs: 1 The Review Unfortunately I don't have the box, because in got smushed in my suitcase on the plane, so needless to say, it was not in top condition... The Manual The manual is an extremely small fold-out. But the image on the front is nice. On the back of the manual, there is a picture of some of the 2008 impulse sets. This is a nice feature. The Parts For an impulse set this has a pretty good selection. A very nice owl, and an interesting clear ball piece. All built This set took me forever to build. I had to take numerous breaks as it was the toughest, longest build I have ever faced! For an impulse set, this actually looks pretty good. The owl perch is nice, also the crystal ball table. The wizard is a very nice fig, with great printing on the legs and hat, and I love his beard. Brickshelf Gallery The Ratings Price: 8/10 (Not bad, but I feel that impulse sets are slightly overpriced) Parts: 7/10 (Impulse sets are focused around the minifig, but the parts in this set are pretty good) Design: 7/10 (The crystal ball is a good idea, and the owl perch is simple but nice) Playability: 6/10 (There is not much to play with here) Build: 8/10 (As I said before, it took forever. Really it took all of 1 minute) Minifig: 10/10 (The wizard is fantastic) Overall: 46/60 Bricklink LEGO S@H Brickset Abracadabra, blades of four... You are now a dinosaur! Summary For an impulse set, this is very nice. The wizard is an excellent fig, and getting an animal in a cheap set is always great. I would definitely recommend this set. Thanks, and happy building!"

While it does come with the basics for an impulse set, I just feel that it lacks something though I am not sure what. Perhaps a printed magic scroll? I am still not a fan of the printed cap (especially the stars), but I do like the printed pants displaying his various goodies hanging from his belt. The plain torso is to be expected from a wizard minifig I suppose. Overall, it's not a bad set but it certainly feels to be lacking something, IMO."

I'm sure you'll get this set eventually. As for the box, well, there's always been 2 box-designs - one for the US and one for EU (actually there's an Asian one as well). The EU doesn't have the box count or the don't swallow (we know that). The US version has the brick count and don't swallow warning (typical US). Thanks for a super review strawberry-ice-man. I like the wizard, I'm only sorry they put him in an impulse set. Who'd want an army of medium blue wizards? So it's the worst army builder, but a cool wizard. Does that make sense?"

Set that cost a lot more than this one. Now for what?€™s inside. The contents of the box, the impulse sets never look that inspiring. Now for the alien, I have to say I?€™m not impressed. I?€™m not a big space fan and I only bought this due to my impulse review challenge, but as the main point of the impulse sets is the alien is a little hard to build a good set round something with one point or articulation. It lacks what make Lego minfigs so great their articulation. Now for the space vehicle, as always with impulse a short and easy build ensues. Took maybe 2 mins at the most. Time to mount the alien in his craft. The craft looks a little wide for him. Slightly better from this angle but still not winning any awards. I?€™m disappointed of the impulse sets I?€™ve reviewed so far this is clearly the weakest of them, but what really disappointing is the other seem so good and useful. The Rating System Figures: 3/10 (The alien is not a good minfig) Parts 6/10 (Some interesting parts but nothing that special.) Fun Fun Fun 2/10 (I can?€™t think of anything to do with this set to be honest.) Design 4/10 (Poorly designed the box makes it look much better.) Price 6/10 (Despite the impulse price tag I?€™m still unhappy about the price.) Grand Total 21/50 (Less than half marks the lowest I?€™ve given so far.) Conclusion. In many ways I?€™m annoyed, from the outside of the box this set looks quite interesting and certainly appears to be well designed. The idea of a small alien fighter/flying craft is in my opinion a good one, but sadly when you?€™ve got the finished product in your hand it looks nothing like the box art. While I think Mission Mars had some interesting sets and I might still get some of them this one will not be a repeat purchase for me."

I hope this review does it justice. So, let's start with the box: NOTE: This picture is not mine. Standard box for Star Wars in that time. The background on the box looks like it's from Geonosis, indicating that this set is from Episode II, and not III or the Clone Wars. The back of the box (not shown) shows the playability functions and some other sets that were released at the same time as this. Overview Here is an overview of the whole set. It comes with one construction manual and no sticker sheets ( ). This is a very simple set, but with not much to it, it is still a very important part of the CIS army, especially if you are interested in army building. I like to call this set a ""super battle pack"", and you'll find out why soon. Let's get right to it, and look at the feature of the set: the Hailfire Tank. Front A front view of the very cool tank. Here you can see two triangular shields on the hull. The main body is very simple, but altogether very effective and clever, and making it really look like a hailfire tank, although a little bit sized down from it's movie version. The trans-red stud used as the ""eye"" makes the tank look more menacing. Side The side view. The wheels are very easy to make, but it's a real pain to connect all of those chain links together. I don't see what you could use the links for, except for another tank, but maybe someone creative will find something for these. The dark tan is nice though. The wheels are held on by Technic poles, and the tank rolls on the wheels fairly well on carpet or a hard surface. Back This is the back of the tank. Here you can see eight flick-fire missiles (four on each side) of the new type, so they don't easily fall out. Also note the modified 2x2 with extended hole piece sticking out of the back. This may be used to easily push around the tank. I just wish you could fit a droid in the body for the cockpit... Now we move on to the Spider Droid, or what I like to call ""The Dwarf Spider"": The front. This one is also simple, but very cleverly built. The main body is two semi-spheres connected together for rotation, and an antenna, a cannon, four legs, and eyes made out of a useful telephone piece. The picture speaks for itself as far as how the gun and eyes are built. Side A side view. You can now see the legs better, which are more sturdy then you would think. Each one is made out of two pearl bronze Exo-force robot arms, a useful bley handgun piece, and a dark bley battle droid body, all connected to the under body (a big knob-like piece). Back The back. Not much to say here. I like this spider droid because it is very sturdy, and the legs are easy to adjust. Finally, we look at the minifigs: There are four minifigs in this set, which is quite generous for a set of this size. It comes with a yellow battle droid commander (I really like this one), two battle droids, and a super battle droid. All three battle droids have the new blaster pistols and one twisted arm. That's about it for the review, so here is the FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, Very fun and easy, besides the chain links. Should take the seasoned builder less than 20 minutes. Playability: 7/10, the flick-fire missiles are fun, as well as just zooming around the tank. Could use some clones for a battle. Swooshability: 8/10, you can roll around the hailfire fairly well. Minifigs: 9/10, a generous amount of figs, and all are pretty good. Design: 9.5/10, a really simple and clever set, although a little too small for the movie version. Price: 10/10, a very fair price considering the price-per-parts ratio and the coolness of the set. Overall Score: 8.5/10, a very neat set to have, a great army builder, and great for display next to all of the other CIS sets. The price is fair, the figs are good, and the build is very clever. That's all for now, folks. Please feel free to give some feedback! Edited by JimButcher, 15 September 2008 - 03:08 AM."

At first glance, this ball on legs may not seem like much, but hopefully this review will change your mind. The box. This box is the standard for all of the new Clone Wars sets: sleek, shiny, and a right-out-of-the-factory look. The blue-and-white color scheme is fantastic, and portrays that the sets are based off of a cartoon well. This box has a ""LIMITED EDITION"" (in Spanish, too! ) seal slapped on the front, although you won't have trouble finding this in your local Toys ""R"" Us, because of the big Clone Wars display in the front of the store that you can't miss. Overview In this picture, you can see the contents of the whole set (minus the instruction booklet) built. You can spot five minifigures (which I'll get to later), and a very tall CIS weapon, known as the Homing Spider Droid. This weapon of destruction is a must-have for your CIS army, although the color scheme (mostly dark bley and light bley) is a change up from the regular colors (brown or blue) of the CIS. This may have something to do with the blended armies of the Trade Federation and Corporate Alliance, but I don't know for sure. The instruction manual is very thin, only about twenty pages. Homing Spider Droid This is the main part of the set. Four huge legs, two mounted guns, and a red sensor eye are the highlights of this artillery unit. There's not many playability factors to this one, but sometimes its just fun to squash the little clones, a change-up of the contrary. It also looks good next to all of the other CIS sets, but you might want to clear some room in your display area; the legs take up a lot of room! This thing is also massively tall, about the same height as the Republic Cruiser. Main Body This is the main body of the spider, which has no cockpit and is remote controlled. This spherical body (not in that sort of way...) is a very quick build, and features a big, red eye connected by a red stud and hinge. Top Gun Here is the top gun (not with Tom Cruise), which is connected to the body using a clever Technic system (pun not intended). As you can see from this picture, you can see that it can rotate a full 360 degrees, but only if you remove the eye. Also, the gun can be pulled back, and if you let go, it will snap back, like the a gun does when fired, due to the force of the shot. I'm not sure this was intended by TLG, because it wasn't showed anywhere on the box or in the manual. Lower Gun Here is the gun attached to the under body of the main part. It is attached using a hinge, which allows it to move up and down. I also like the cord (that presumably transfers power) included on both guns. Hips Here is one of the hips attaching the legs to the body. There is one on each side, with two legs each. The are attached to the body and legs with Technic pieces. Legs You can see the tall legs in this pic. They are basically just Technic poles and connectors. Feet This is one of the feet, the essential to balancing the whole vehicle. These and the legs are repetitive, so I suggest doing them all at the same time to avoid flipping back in the manual and repeating the process three more times. The picture speaks for itself for the design of the feet. All are connected to the legs using a double-holed Technic piece. One Massive Son of a Gun This thing is so tall! It frightens the skin off of even the toughest, most experienced soldiers. Run for your Lives!! Look at how much havoc and fear it causes! Family Photo Enough of the battle scenes, here is a shot of this spider with it's smaller cousin: the Dwarf Spider Droid. Minifigs Finally, here are the minifigs that come with this set. There are five in all, which include: Battle Droid: Nothing special, but still an addition to your army Commander Battle Droid: I love that yellow torso! Super Battle Droid: Again, nothing special Clone Trooper: I'm glad they gave us one in this set, I can add it to to my other Phase 1 clones. Commander Fox: I love it! Everything from the dark red markings to the accessories are fantastic! The head is just the regular anime style Clone Wars face. This set comes with two flashlights, two antennae, one visor, one pauldron, and one kama. Close-up of Fox Here is a close-up of Fox, so you can see the detailed insignia of the Republic Guard. That wraps it up for the review, here is the FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, very easy and straightforward, a little repetitive with the legs. Should take the seosoned builder around 20 minutes. Playability: 6/10, not many play factors, but it's fun to just squash puny clones with this giant arachnid. Swooshability: N/A Minifigs: 10/10, you really can't ask for more in this sort of set! Design: 8/10, not very sturdy, but it is altogether clever. Price: 5/10, yes, it is limited edition, but pumping up the price fifteen dollars more than it should be is a little ridiculous. Overall Score: 8.5/10, An excellent set for display, although not very sturdy. Minifigs are superb, but the price could be better. In the end, I would highly recommend this to any Prequel Trilogy fan looking to build up his/ her army. Well, that's about it for this review, Please feel free to leave your opinions!

It's an Iron drone, and it's marching on its Sentry! Set data 7711: Sentry Year: 2006 Theme: Exo-Force Subtheme: Robots Pieces: 74 (+4 extra) <- both counting Hinge control stick and its base as two separate pieces Price: Euro 7 circa, MISB, including S/H, on eBay; RRP was Euro 5 circa / 5 USD. Probably 5 UKP. Building time: 20/25 minutes (10 minutes building, the rest of the time placing stickers!) More info: Brickset - Peeron Being 2006 my last dark year, I wasn't a big ExoForce fan but they were ok. I tought 2007 models were better, and still think 2008 models are the best. That basically means 1) It's a shame that there will be no more of this line and 2) this is my first 2006 model, yet I bought in in July 2008. Ok, let's do this one. Box front: box was battered due to Italian Post; they'll do their best to give Lego boxes a ""war"" outlook. Close-up: the Japanese katakana read ""tokushu butai"" -> special (military) force(s) Box back: amazing alternate model; some like it more than the original design. Box content: a small but capable sticker sheet, two bags and instructions. Sticker sheet: and they're numbered! Random instructions page: connecting legs to the body Instructions page - sticker detail: that's why they're numbered. Instructions page - parts inventory: does anybody check if they're all there before building? Surely not me. Loose pieces: nothing rare, I think; small Techinc parts come in different colours, as usual (you often don't see them when the model is complete, but sometimes you do) The Iron drone: ""strong and durable"" (and much better looking than those crappy MM jelly aliens) Building starts. The open cockpit - front and rear view Left leg - front and rear view; right leg is built of the same pieces. Left arm - with laser cannon The cannon - great use of the hollow studs with the ""Plant Tree Palm Top"" Right arm - with twin missiles Complete model - front view Complete model - side view and rear view Rating and review. Parts and building: nothing new, but both models are O.K. Instead of waiting the last page of the manual, you'd better put the stickers in place while building. Looking at the box you'd tell stickers background is (trans) purple. It actually is trans clear (excpet for the yellow and black stripes - warning: hazard!). Try not to put your fingerprints on the sticky side! Consider using tweezers. Posability: both legs and both arms feature three joints; and that's good, so that the weight doesn't have the Sentry falling down. Final model: smaller compared to 2007 Claw Crusher and 2008 Batlle Arachnoid, but cheaper and surely worth the money. The ""minifig"" is just another Iron drone, not much to say. Final rating: 3,5/5 Edited by Sinner, 01 September 2008 - 02:22 AM."

Nowadays they mecha are perhaps more cleverly designed, and use ball joints for playability. But I really love the blocky bulky look of the first Drone's machines. And somehow the older ones seem a better value of parts. I'm more inclined to buy duplicates of them than the newer models."

We are experiencing radio difficulties since discovering a number of strange radioactive arctic life forms which seem to be effecting our signal, OVER. We have encountered a large polar bear which by all account appears to be friendly and playful. Our food supply; however, has diminished quickly, and we have to venture North from the base to a frozen lake in search of fish. Our cordinates are currently 46Â°45â?²4â?³N, 741Â°21â?²7â?³W. We do plan to take the snowmobile to the lake after we get our provisions in order. This is Polar-1, OUT. Polar Explorer Bonus Pack Set #: 6569 Theme: Arctic Year Released: 2000 Piece Count: 76 Minifigs: 2 List Price: $10 (USD) In 2000, Lego introduced a new theme called Arctic. It was something completely new and different for Lego as no mini-fig scale sets and/or adventurers had ever ventured to the Arctic. The set offered new orange pieces and combined elements of blue and white pieces to provide a number of sleds, vehicles, a mobile outpost (6520), and even a large polar base (6575). The theme was unfortunately short lived and did not see 2001. This particular set is a ""value pack"" that combines sets 6578 (Polar Explorer) and 6586 (Polar Scout) at a reasonable price of $10 (USD). I may have even paid a few dollars less at a discount toy store back in the early 2000s. A picture of the ""Bonus Pack"" with the two sets combined within the box: The backside features an advertisement for the Lego Club and pictures of other Arctic sets: Starting with the smaller set, The Polar Explorer (just a tip of the iceberg ): Instructions Front of Box Back of Box Both sets include the same minifig, an Arctic fig with glasses and a thick arctic coat: Here's a shot of the fig with his hood on. I always thought the hood is a nice piece that would work well for Hoth Rebel snow scenes. The set includes a few nice accessories: The set actually creates a small ice/snow formation that can even be placed on water to represent an iceberg: Here's a close-up with the blue ice spider: The complete set: Next, the Polar Scout: Front of Box Back of Box The Polar Scout instructions picture the same image as the box: But I really like the real arctic imagery on the backside: The set includes a small sheet of decals: Included are some great arctic accessories: And some interesting arctic creatures, like this neon orange scorpion in a ball of ice: I love the polar bear, a great addition to snow scenes: But the best part of this set is the orange and black sled: The back sled attachment (U-Haul) has some tools and a removable storage cover: The top comes off easy to store tools and equipment: Here's the arctic fig with a great metal detector (or other snow research device): And the sled itself: Lastly, a picture of the complete Polar Scout: Final Thoughts: I'm a little disappointed that Arctic was a short-lived theme. At the time, I wasn't too interested in the Arctic, but I still regret not buying the large Polar Research Base after seeing it at a discounted price. I was able to pick up this set and the Mobile Outpost that I never opened. I'd be interesting in reading your thoughts in regard to this set and the Arctic Theme."

As for the theme itself, I though it was a very interesting theme. Sadly I don’t think Lego put enough effort into it, I was personally upset not to se a second year even if I didn’t buy any of the sets. It reminds me of the artic theme Playmobil did at one point in the distant past to be honest. I think a number of good artic scenes were missed, when it came out a really wanted to get a ski plane but it never came, I built it myself in the end but I don’t know how Lego missed that one. On a slightly random note I do know that at least one Lego minifig did make it all the way to the real artic with a research team, sadly I don’t have any pictures to offer you."

I voted both times for Outstanding because: I really the Arctic theme. I only bought the ice sailor but otherwise no sets because of money and place reasons and because I already collect four themes (City, older Castle, Western and Star Wars Old Triology). But a comeback of the Arctic theme - perhaps as addition to a winter sports and winter rescue theme would be very welcome! I really all sets - the little and the big ones. In my opinion they all were very well designed (not too big vehicles, not too little and not minimalitic, great minifigs and very nice and lovely details and accessory). Klaus-Dieter"

This is really our third such extravaganza, but the first one to actually be done right, so it's my great honour to welcome all of you to this event. I'm your hostess with the mostest, er, host, ImperialShadows, getting in the way and generally causing mayhem will be Staudie, of course, and actually presenting the review will be cub reporter and senior reviewer, WhiteFang! Yes, the ever popular WhiteFang of the Reviewer's Academy. You know him, you love him, let's hear some applause! *audience cheers wildly* Oh, that's too kind, now how about some for WhiteFang? Name: Airplane Mechanic Theme: LEGO System / Town / City Year: 2006 Pieces: 26 Minifigs: 1 Price: USD$3.50 The featured set will be a 7901 Airplane Mechanic. This is the smallest set ever released in the CITY sub theme, Airport. We will be bringing you to on site experience in the hanger. Today our special guest is a mechanic who is specially trained to handle with jet engine turbines. *Camera Rolls* Aren't our pose look so cool? Staudie, your clothes are still white. Let's just all try to smile until this picture is done. Look at our special guest. He can still smile in that weird position of his. Quiet you! *Interviewing process* I am the airplane mechanic, holding a grade 2 license. My specialisation is to maintain and repair jet turbines of 7893 and 7894 Passenger Planes. We have many mechanics, 24/7, across international airports, making sure that the planes are in safe condition. We are able to maintain from Rolls Royce, Pratt & Whitney and General Electric engines as well. This is the trolley to push the turbine engine around. This model is used for Passenger Planes 7893 and 7894 series. Look at the size of the turbine. It required actually 4 engine turbines like this, to power a 7893 Passenger Plane aircraft. I have all these nice essential tools, to work on that engine behind me. There is a wrench, hammer, oilcan, open end wrench, power drill and screwdriver. *Whistles Innocently* Geez, he thought no one would notice him pushing the engine away? *Testing process* As you can see, the crane is firm and sturdy. It is able to lift the engine at a certain height. Hey get off there! For goodness sake, this is not a rodeo. Yee-Ha! WhiteFang must fixed his loose wires. I knew we shouldn't let him read those Superman comics on break. Give a man a cape, and he thinks he can fly. *the audience laughs* What's so funny? It's dangerous to stand at that position. Staudie, are you done with your measuring yet? Almost there. *Clang Bang Clank* Oof! Get this thing off me! I'll push, you pull! Let's get moving! *CLANG* I think I sprained my pride. No, wait, it's my back. I gave up my pride when I took over this news organization. *Shadows flips the engine, crushing WhiteFang* Get that hook off my head... Guess, we are heading for a commerical break at the moment. Wait up, let me pull the white curtain. That's all, everyone. With me, Staudie bringing the end of the show. ImperialShadows and WhiteFang are currently in the LEGOLAND Hospital where WhiteFang is getting patched up and Shadows is flirting with the nurses, mostly. I really hope you loved this interactive review brought to you by EB News Reviews. Overall, we felt that this was a very good impulse set with a wide range of mechanical tools and an extra turbine to play with. Therefore, we recommend you to get it since it's very affordable. Anyway, every airport need mechanics/engineers to maintain the aircrafts to make sure it's certified to fly. This is too formal. I hate reading it from WhiteFang's script. It's best to do it in Staudie's style. Yo yo yo, whazzup? Er. No, that isn't it either. Um... Thanks for viewing! I hope to bring you another exciting and information review soon, here on EB News Reviews! *Camera Fades*"

You should go visit the Witch and her Fireplace. She can brew you up a potion for any occasion or purpose. So head down to see the Witch right now. Although this set is from the Fright Knights theme it can easily fit in with any other castle theme due to the lack of specialised Fright Knight parts and printings. The set comes with no astounding parts but looks like the source for our good magician impulse set from the current castle theme. I think I got this as a promo set. Official Pic. The box art for the set has the standard Fright Knight background and lego system logo followed by the set number. Down the left hand side of the box a cat is attempting a head stand. Also I think this box display the contents of the set in an attractive set up as usual. 1. The whole set minifigs and all Here is the witch. On the torso there is a spider amulet which is a little hard to make out due to the low res of the image. The Witches wand is the same as the Bellville fairy wands except in trans red like a lightsaber blade although it is completely useful as a lightsaber. As you have probably noticed the witch has no legs instead she has a slope brick with the dress pattern printed on witch (get it witch-which) looks better than Asajj Ventress' from the new clone wars sets in my opinon. (for this anyway) The Fairysaber (new word) duel. This is the old run down fireplace of the Witch. At the base there are two smouldering coals instead of fire witch (it's not funny any more is it?) doesn't make that much sense seeming as it is a fireplace. The little triangular brick on top doesn't really do anything I also accidentally put the wrong one on while building, it should be a sloping brick. Here are the coals. The old trans orange studs are less translucent than the new ones. I like how they have places them above the main baseplate on a 1x2 plate so they are in line with the rest of the fire place other wise it would look wrong. Here is everything else I haven't covered yet, the crystal ball, the pets and the magical potion vial. The crystal ball is identical to the one included with the Good Wizard impulse form the current castle theme. I like the molds for the cat and the bat although if the cat had some yellow printing for the eyes like the white cat had black for the eyes it would be much better. I think the trans green tube things are a little uncommon but I'm not worried about that. 2. Overall Build: 6/10 Extremely puzzling and difficult do not attempt alone . It's pretty simple but seeming as it has a load of stuff you can move around it is good. Minifigs: 9/10 I really like the witch and it couldn't have really come with anyone else also it came with the wand which is really good too. Design: 8/10 It should have come with some fire and maybe some more orange bricks to put at the base. Parts: 8/10 The minifigure isn't bad nor are the animals or the trans green part. Price: 10/10 I am guessing this was pretty good. Seeming as I think I got this as a promo I gave it 10 because it was free. Playability: 7/10 As wth all impulse sets there isn't much here but at least it comes with some animals to have a fight with or give the witch rabies. Overall: 8/10 If it came with some more stuff for the fire place and the cat was more detailed it would have scored higher but because this set can easily be intergrated with other castle sets it got a mighty 8. 3. Mini comic ! Hocus pocus magic shocus turn my pets into dinosaurs (not to catchy is it?) *Poof* Oh know I think I might drink my magical potion glug glug glug Oh! my"

I voted for Outstanding since this set is a little but very lovely set. I really it (although I don't own it yet ) since it's very similar to today's Impulse sets: a minifig and some nice additional stuff. And I like the black cat which gives the set a more gloomy atmosphere. Hopefully TLG will include a black cat and a chimney like in this set in the new advent calendar, too. Klaus-Dieter"

About this set, this is a cheap way to buy this set with a witch and some nifty accessories such as the black cat. In fact, I think this is the first time I had ever seen a black cat. It's simple, but not very useful in my collection. Because other Fright Knight sets also offer the witches too. I don't need many witches. Overall, I feel that this is an average set."

The King has declared a royal tournament pitting the brave knight in his shining armour, against the feared skeleton warrior and his shadow horse. The jousting arena is set up so let the joust begin! 7009 The Final Joust Set Info Set Name: 7009 The Final Joust Theme: Castle Released: 2007 Price: USD 7.99-GBP 5.99-EUR 7.95 Pieces-62 Minifigs: 2 figs 2 horses Price Per Piece: About 13 cents Let the games begin! Box Shots The front has an image of the knight and skeleton jousting with lightning in the background. The Back show the two now fighting with an ax and ball and chain. I don't really like the box image, as I think the background looks too dark. Manual The front has the same picture as on the box. On the back some of the other 2007 castle sets are displayed. This is better than the usual sweepstakes image that we get. The Pieces Nothing really special here. But you at least get a good assortment of weapons. Shields I always like LEGO shields and these are no exception. The patterns are great. Minifigs First the horses. These are great, the knight's horse's coverings are really nice. Now, the minifigs. The knight and skeleton both have nice armor. The torsos are plain black for the skeleton and bley for the knight. The Finished Product In the middle is the jousting barrier which is simple, but serves its purpose. On the left we have the weapon rack which is good. It would have been nice if TLG had included a rack for the skeleton as well though. Extra Parts Only two extra white parts here. You can use them if your knight's horse wants to retire and look like a normal horse again. Oh! That has to hurt! It seems that the skellie has won this round! Poor knight... Brickshelf Folder Now, For The Ratings! Price: 7/10 (Not a very good price per piece ratio, however at least 2 figs and 2 horses are included) Parts: 7/10 (The shields and log bricks are nice, but most of the others are nothing spectacular) Design: 8/10 (Relatively well designed, but a bit boring) Playability: 8/10 (You can joust with it and that's about all) Build: 8/10 (Short and easy) Overall: 38/50 Brickset LEGO S@H Peeron Bricklink Strike! It seems that the horses have rebelled against their riders... Summary This set although not amazing, is still a very solid set. The minifigs are great and so are the horses, but the rest of the set kind of feels like an afterthought. Even with its negative aspects I still recommend it, especially if you are a Castle fan.

Overall set and figs Official box pic. This indicates it is a Geonosis set from the background but it is no different from any other set same old brown separatist ship/s. The whole set. Some red tan droids would have been nice like in the Geonosian fighter set. All the minifigs. The super battle droid body is slightly different to the one in the BP. It looks more grainy and silver. I doubt this has any relevance for it being a geonosis set but I like them better how they were in the BP's The Super Battle droid body dwarfing the commander droids body. I think that the new Commander droids body is better than the old one with just the yellow strip even though it is less accurate. New twisted Battle Droid arm, each droid has one of these. I don't really like having droids with these new guns I think the older guns suited them much better. 2. Hailfire Droid Hailfire droid by itself. It is certainly smaller than the original. Seeming as this is the main part of the set I was hoping it would be bigger but I don't mind it being this small too much. Wheels and rockets can fold outwards and inwards The wheels which spin round two large clear discs and made from loads of these tiny links. This is probably the best way to make the wheels on this small scale. The only other alternatives I can think of are using the tracks from the Wookiee Attack set or catterpilla tracks, both of which wouldn't look right. One of the missile pods. These use the new flick-fire missiles which don't fall out are an excellent idea. They should have come with the purple cones like on the Magna guards staffs instead of red though because in the film the missiles are purple. One of the new flickfire missiles that don't drop out when the model is tilted forward. I don't know what the holes in them are for though. The 3 ""eyes"" are made up of 2 trans red cheese bricks for the sides and 1 trans red stud for the center.You can also see how the missile pods are attached to the side of the body. This is the back of the Hailfire Droid. There is a plate with a hole in, I have found only one purpose for this. The Hailfire Droid is the Commander droids war chariot! What do you use the plate for? 3. Spider Droid The Spider Droid. The design has been greatly improved from the Wookiee attack set. Not only is it more accurate but also more poseable which is useful when setting up battle scenes. The ball joint provides the place to put the antenna which isn't long enough but the dome form the old set looks more like the droid form Star wars Episode II. The eyes are made of a telephone piece with 2 trans red studs on. In the original it had orange studs. The eyes can be seen in action 2 pics down. I told you it was a telephone. 1 of 4 identical legs. These are very easy to adjust into what ever position you want and are much better than the originals. But a word of warning never pull them apart as I did they become very loose when put back together so I put some blue tack in the holes. 4.Overall Build: 7/10 A little to repetitive for my liking. Minifigs: 8/10 4 figs for £20 isn't too bad plus they come with new guns. Design: 9/10 Both vehicles are very well designed but the hailfire's small size let the set down. Parts: 8/10 Comes with lots of useful (maybe not ) Brown track links. Price:7/10 Not too bad with 4 figs and loads of little brown links. Playability: 6/10 Not to much on it's own Overall: 7/10 If it came with some clones and tan red droids it would be better.

This will be my eighth review on the boards. Strangely enough, there was another set called the V-Wing Fighter that came out in 1997 for the Space theme. Note that I am missing several small pieces to this set, but they are mostly insignificant to the overall look. The Box This is the standard box type for all 2005-2006 Star Wars sets. I can't say that I like it as much as the 2007 or 2008 box types, but it'll do. It features a profile view of Darth Vader and silver text. Overview This is the whole set. This ship is meant to protect the Chancellor at all costs. They are usually found in groups of three or four. Front This ship is very sleek, and you'll notice that it's colors are dark red, light bley, and dark bley with a touch of black. It starts at the nose very narrow, but as the body progresses to the back, it gets wider, like a ""V"" (hence the name). Back Here is a view of the rear. Note the trans-neon green discs used to represent the boosters. Also notice the dark red R4 astro droid and the hinges used as aromor. Flight All four wings (two on each side) can open up for flight/ attack mode. They can open even farther then the pic shows, but it's not an intended function. The wings a great, but it's a real pain to position them correctly, and the bottom wings close when you set the ship down. Tail fins This is what the tail fins look like on each side, with two flaps attached to the top and bottom. If you look closely, the tail fins and wings look a little bit like a mini ship themselves, maybe controlled by remote. No, this is not an intended function, either. Guns, side The guns are very simple but very clever, using a double Technic hole piece, two black bars, and two Technic pins. Also note the landing gear. Minifig Finally, here is the minifig: a clone pilot. It has light blue arms and legs, white hands, a helmet with black markings and Republic insignia on it, and a double-sided torso. The front of the torso is great, featuring shoulder straps, armor plating, and a life support system. While this minifig is not altogether accurate to the movie, it has still been one of my favorite Star Wars figs. Back The back of the fig that can double as the front of clone marines. This side features shoulder straps and armor plating. Cockpit Lastly, here is the pilot seated in the cockpit. He fits perfectly, although it is not air-tight. We wouldn't want the poor guy to suffocate, now would we? That wraps up the review, here is the FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, a nice, easy, build, and the last of the small SW ships ($10 or less). Playability: 6/10, pretty fun to swoosh around, but that's about it. Could use a vulture droid, but that would take away the 'small' factor. Swooshability: 10/10, very fun and easy to swoosh around endlessly, without fear of it breaking. Minifigs: 9/10, there really is no need to have more, although a Palpy fig would be outstanding. The pilot is a great figure though. Design: 9/10, extremely accurate to the movie, but the cockpit is not airtight. Price: 10/10, you couldn't ask for a better deal! Overall Score: 8.6, an excellent set. Unfortunately, this is the last of the small SW ships currently. The fig is great, and the sleek design is accurate. That just about sums it all up, feel free to leave your comments! Edited by JimButcher, 15 September 2008 - 03:11 AM."

If so, this is the set for you! 852271 Knights Battle Pack Set Info Set Name: 852271 Knights Battle Pack Theme: Castle Released: 2008 Price: USD 12.99-GBP 6.49-EUR 9.95 Minifigs: 5 It's army building time! Packaging The figs come in a plastic box with a slide out tray. To open, you slide out a tab on the bottom, and pull the tray out. The Weapons One plus of this set is the good weapon selection. You get a whopping 5 shields, a spear, a lance, acrossbow, a pointed lance thing and a lovely chrome sword Minifigures Now the main focus of this set, the figs! One thing that's nice here is that you get a good selection of different knights. The figs are quite nice, with different faces and helmets for almost every one. Minifig Backsides! I really like the archer's quiver. Two sided head The Archer has a scared head on the other side. Brickshelf Folder And now, the ratings! Price: 6/10 (Certainly a bit overpriced. It should have been $10. The Star Wars battle packs have only 1 less fig plus some parts for $5 less) Parts: 8/10 (No bricks, but a nice selection of weapons) Minifigs 9/10 (The figs are great) Overall: 23/30 LEGO S@H Brickset Bricklink Even with a bigger army, the poor knights are no match for modern technology... Summary Even though the pack is a bit overpriced, it is still great for increasing your army's size. I would get this set if you are a Castle fan looking to expand your army, otherwise don't worry if you pass on this set. Thanks, and happy building!"

I don't see it being a big deal as customization is always an option. Concerning the set: Not much to say other than it does what it's suppose to do: build up one's army of knights. The variance of faces and accessories are great. I especially love the chrome sword. The price isn't bad either since the package comes with five nice figs and some great equipment.

The Box A very nice small square box with the policeman and his dog on the front. And the back which shows the officer running to the scene of the crime, walkie-talkie in hand. Instruction Manual The back of the manual has the 2008 Police sets and impulse sets pictured. It is interesting that the Good Wizard is on here even though I bought this set in the U.S. On this side you see how to build the model in 8 grueling steps... The Parts Not much out of the ordinary here except for the lovely printed road sign. Minifigs Here are the 2 figs, Stud and Mr. Brickop! They make a great team don't they? Extra Parts This set comes with a surprisingly large amount of extras for such a small set. All Built After it's all built, you get a pretty nice set.

With his shining armor and weapons, he's ready to defend the Castle against any foe. Includes knight minifigure with armor, shield and weapons! Peeron Inventory Bricklink Inventory Brickshelf Gallery Now to the review! The Box The box is fairly standard and illustrates the set well. The Back The back of the box is just an advertisement. The Instructions The instructions are simplistic, basic, and short. The Back of the Instructions The back of the instructions show the other impulse sets, as well as a few others. The Weapon Rack This nifty little weapon rack holds the sword, the shield, as well as a different style helmet and armour plate. The Minifigure The minifigure is of the standard castle variety, with the basic torso and helmet, and a slight scowl on his face. Accessories/Weapons The set comes with a shield, a spear, and a sword.I particularly like the pattern on the shield Different configurations With the extra pieces of equipment I mentioned earlier, itis possible to turn your figure into something totally different... The Entire Set This picture shows the weapon rack and the knight, ready to ward off skeleton invaders! Overall Build: 9/10 The build is simplistic and suitable for all ages. Design: 7/10 There really isnt much to judge in this category... playability: 8/10 With another minifig, plenty of exciting battles can be made! Minifigs: 9/10 With plenty of customisation options, you can turn this one minifig into almost anything. Price: 10/10 This set is well worth the price tag. Overall:43/50 Conclusion I really enjoy these impulse sets. For a casual lego-builder who doesn`t want to invest top dollar in lego, they are perfect, and for the hardcore fan, you could easily buy 5 or 6 of these to boost your army.

Includes 2 knights, skeleton and a skeleton horse! Rolling wagon has a launcher that really fires! Bricklink Inventory Peeron Inventory Brickshelf Gallery Now, On to The Review! The Box As you can see, the front of the box illustrates the set very nicely, showing the skeleton warrior attacking and the knights firing their crossbow. The Back The Back of the box shows a small battle happening between a knight and a skeleton, as well as the main feature of the set, the firing crossbow (more on that later.) The Instructions Not much to say here, its the same as the front of the box. The Back of The Instructions This merely shows pictures of other sets in the castle line. Random Instruction page This set does not use piece callouts to tell you what parts you will need in each step. However, the set is so small you should never have trouble finding a piece. The Minifigures This is the main reason I bought this set. You get two knights, one with a standard helmet, and the other one with a new mold. You also get a skeleton warrior. The Horse The set comes with a skeleton horse that looks great. However, it is a single molded piece that has no articulation. Close-up of the Warrior riding his horse Here you see the brave skeleton riding in on his...ah......er......um......noble steed! The Accessories/Weapons For Minifigure Accessories, you get an axe, a skeleton sword, and a skeleton shield. Extra Pieces I was left with one skeleton arm and one leg when I was finished the build. The Crossbow Wagon and now, to the main part of the set, the crossbow wagon. It is really just a plate with some whells attached and a lot of those cheese wedge pieces to create the track for the projectile. Back View This view shows the mechanism that makes the crossbow fire. It is powered by a rubber band. You pull back on a technic piece, which creates tension in the elastic band. When you let go, the elastic pushes the piece forward, which in turn hits the projectile and makes it fire! It works fairly well, but I would have prefered it fired farther. Entire Set The Skeleton charges at his adversaries! The knights prepare to counterattack! Overall Build: 10/10 The build is simple, easy and quick. Set design: 7/10 The crossbow could have worked a bit better. Playability: 8/10 The crossbow is fun to shoot. Minifigs: 10/10 It doent get much better than this. I love that domed helmet mold! Price: 8/10 The set is very affordable and worth the price. Overall Score:43/50 Conclusion Overall, this is a great set and a solid army builder. You get three minifigures for a fair price and the crossbow wagon adds some much-needed playability. I bought two of these to bolster my army and to stock up on those rare domed helmet pieces. Basically, get this set! Thank you for taking the time to read my review. I hope you liked it!"

It also comes with a lot of blue 1x1 slopes that are always useful and quite rare to obtain. Another weapon for the soldier operating the catapult (or a shield for the other soldier) would have been great, but that is pushing it. The crossbow itself is quite nice and is better than what most $6 sets come with, IMO. Overall, a good set indeed. Thank you for the review and the other review concerning The Knight, of which I hope to buy in the near future as it looks like it comes with a great deal of goodies. The weapon rack is useful, too."

The one thing, however, that I don't like about it, is that one of the catapult operators isn't armed. In my opinion, this would have been a good time for TLG to release a suitable dagger piece (not the kitchen knife) for its Castle line. Great review, by the way, it captured the key elements of this fantastic small set."

You got all the details someone could possibly need, in my opinion at least. I do enjoy this set as well, and I've bought only one to keep my minifigs as unique as possible. Despite my personal preference, I still find this a nice army builder. Good amount of minifigs for the price, as mentioned earlier, with each being different from the other. Though I would like the catapult manager to be armed with at least something, I still feel that he can just flee if he's ever in trouble. He's a good guy to use for the Castle gimmics if you have it. One more small comment. I also love those domed helmets, even if they aren't actually new. My favorite of them all, being followed up by the racer helmet."

The Manual The image on the manual is the same as on the box front. Random Manual Shot No piece call-outs, but the color distinction is not a problem. The Parts 193 pieces doesn't seem like a lot, but many of them are quite large. The selection is pretty good. Lots of greys and black. Minifigs With this set comes a whopping 5 minifigs which is amazing for a $20 set. The knights are very nice and one has a double-sided head. The Horses Adding to the already large minifig count are the 4 horses. 3 skeleton horses, and 1 great brown horse for the knight. Extra Parts Now, the finished set! First, we have the brave knight on his brown stallion. The horse's head covering looks very nice. And the knight gets a nice long pointy stick. The main event, the prison carriage! The design of this is excellent. With the bionicle piece and the white horns, it looks very spooky. The Tower This part is one of my favorites. It uses white horns to give it a great creepy look. One problem is that there is barely enough room for the 2 skeletons. The Driver Here you can see the driver and his whip. You can also see the bionicle spine. A side view When you look from the side, you can see the great design of the prison. It is placed on tiles for easy removal and looks great with the round white 1 x 1s on the corners. Horses' Harness This is another very well designed portion of the set. The harness attaches easily to the horses and to the carriage. The Prison Look at the poor imprisoned knight. Let's try to free him! The back of the prison hinges down! The knight is freed! Everything Together All together, the set looks fantastic. The carriage has a great creepy skeleton feel, and getting 9 minifigs is amazing. Brickshelf Folder Ratings Price: 10/10 (193 pieces and 9 figs is fantastic for $20) Parts: 9/10 (Lots of good large pieces) Design: 10/10 (Captures the spooky skeleton look very well) Playability: 8/10 (It's fun to try and free the prisoner and the carriage rolls well) Build: 9/10 (Easy but fun) Minifigs: 10/10 (The sheer amount of figs is great and they look great) Overall: 56/60 The future of LEGO Castle... Summary This is an amazing set for the price. A huge amout of minifigs, combined with a great design and good playabilty makes the set a winner. I would certainly recommend this set to anyone that remotely likes LEGO sets. Thanks, and happy building!"

My favorite part about it is probably the fact that you can give almost every included minifig a mount, except for one poor knight . However, another part I like is that the horse includes a plain saddle, which is a nice relief after the overabundance of the gold-plate barding, which is nice, but overused in the early sets. Also, the SW jokes are hilarious! I particularly the running gag with the walker, but I like this one too. Reason for Edit: I made a mistake due to a loss of internet and an accidental post.

I am not sure how I feel about this set. While it does include five figs, three are skeletons and are generally worth much less than say three trolls/orcs (I know they didn't exist at this point in time so this is understandable). The amount of horses is nice, but I'm not a big LEGO horse fan. What this set does have is a great appearance and brings atmosphere to the table. $20 is an affordable amount for those of us who do not wish to splurge too much on a toy while being enough to actually get a large enough set to create something out of. Personally, I'd rate it in between average and above average. Like another Castle set (I can't remember which), I just feel this one also lacks something."

There's alot of great pieces (I especially like the spiked thingy on the front), and it makes a great addition for any skeletal army. Above all, I just love the spine-chilling feeling of it. If I were a minifig in a Legoland, I'd be scared out of my pants-piece if I saw a carriage like that rolling towards me in a dark night."

Last year Argos in the UK reduced it to £7.99, which was a true bargain and sent me all over London looking for a store with more in stock. Again as with all the Lego castle sets I think what makes it work so well is that Lego are now providing a much larger number of minfigs and that’s often what makes a set."

Out of all the castle sets, this one remains one of my favorites. I got it for Christmas in 2007, before I intended to spend much money on the new Castle theme (that changed once I managed to get the King's Castle Siege for a very good price). It's really a wonderful set all around - the design accomplishes the spooky undead feel very well, and it contains a good piece selection and a phenomenal amount of minifigs. Seriously, this set is almost unrivaled in modern lego in the final area - I'm still amazed at how many minifigures TLC put in the kit. I also appreciate that the carriage has a far more realistic horse arangement - after all the sillyness of the one-horse pulled siege engines in KK, it's good to finally see a carriage pulled by multiple horses again. All in all, an excellent set, and well worth $20 IMO."

A mother-in-law buried? A treasure kept? No problem, here I come ! Only one booklet for instructions without any alternative model: It's divided into two sections for two seperate baggies which the parts come in. Parts come in two big bags: A few big pieces and the stickers are loose in the box. Extra parts and sticker sheet: Dark bluish gray 1x1 round plates are meant to be used as cement. Sticker sheet is neat. A standard worker with helmet: He comes with a shovel. Colour scheme makes it easy to understand the instructions: It's easy for younger Lego enthusiasts to build the model. Building in progress: Chassis of the truck is really sturdy. Drivers seat is on the left: I wish we had a real seat instead of a modified tile. Working drum mechanism: You can turn the cement drum from a handle on the front right. Nice details on the front: Rearview mirrors are great. I love the SNOT front panel too. Control panel on the left: Cement hose hardly fits its place and the hose is too thick. Don't forget the shovel: SNOT technique is used on the back panel as well. Long & wide truck with 8 wheels: I love the 6-stud-wide design of new town series. Cement drum actually works: If you place a couple of 1x1 plates in the drum and turn the handle it pours out the little cement parts! Man at work: All this hard work gave me wrinkles on my face :( Folder when public: Brickshelf Rating: -Figures: 6/10 Nothing special with the figure but what did I expect? At least we have a face expression. -Parts: 6/10 Standart parts for a truck but the big blue drum is new. -Price: 8/10 Very nice and detailed truck for 15 USD. -Design: 9/10 It really does look great, doesn't it? -Building: 8/10 Easy to build and it's fun with a little use of SNOT. -Total: 37/50 It's a must for every town. But other players should find it attractive as well. Conclusion: I occasionally order Town sets but I felt a great urge to build this when I first saw it on Brickshelf. When it was released I ordered it right away. Ten days later I was amazed looking at this beauty by my table. We didn't have a cement mixer for ages and I'm sure every Town builder will have this set. And I have no doubt non-Town enthusiasts, like me, will consider getting this.

It's a small battle wagon with blades on the front, probably to demolish rocks in mines. But in this case, our hero dwarf has to use his machine against the evil trolls who want to destroy his happy kingdom. There is only one small booklet for instructions, no alternate model: Parts come in two bags, one for small pieces and one for bigger ones: Apart from the lovely figures, the brown parts will be quite useful for any castle builder. Extra parts are not even worth mentioning, there are no stickers: Figures are detailed enough, dwarf is lovely with his beard but his legs won't move because he is short: Figures are the main attraction for adult players. We haven't seen castle army builder sets for a long while and this is closest we've got in recent years. The dwarf is a little taller than it should have been but it's not possible to do so without creating a completely new mould for figures and that would be expensive. Its beard is oversized as well but that gives him a Legoish look which I like a lot. The trolls - that's what everybody calls them but I say they are orcs - are obviously evil but they are friendly enough not to scare our munchkins. But I wish they had different torsos or at least different faces like crownies. There are not enough weapons to arm everyone but the flag pole is really nice: Unlike the Star Wars army builders, this set has very little weaponry. Only one sword and one pike creates scarcity for 3 figures - Star Wars sets had 4 figures for same price! So I hope our middle age warriors don't come across any stormtroopers :) Building in progress: When you pull the chain the catapult fires a round brick: The set has quite good playability, moving blades and firing catapult should be fun for little children. I wouldn't expect more functions for such a small sized model, it hardly covers my hand. The blades move with the front wheel on the right: There is only one little downside, there is too much friction for the wheel and blades won't move synchronized. You may come over this problem by adjusting the blade height and lining them with the wheels. Mow the little buggers! You can adjust the blade height: There isn't enough room for the dwarf: Folder when public: http://www.brickshel...ry.cgi?f=338578 Rating: -Figures: 8/10 Dwarf is amazing, trolls are great too but I wish they had different faces. -Parts: 7/10 Brown slopes are new, rest is ok too. -Price: 7/10 Acceptable but we have seen sets with more figures for less. -Design: 6/10 It looks kind of steampunkish but could be better with a little detail. -Building: 6/10 Not repeating itself, still nothing exciting. -Total: 34/50 Castle fans will definetely order this one but average Lego player may not be interested. Conclusion: Overall, it's a nice set and I'd recommend it if you like the castle theme. You'll find some good use for the figures and this is the cheapest figure set of the year - at 3.33 USD each. It could have more armory and weaponry but otherwise it's quite alright. Skip lunch today and order this little set! Links: Brickset Reviews Bricklink Entry Peeron Inventory"

While I was studying for exams a few weeks back I decided to take a break, built the monorail and take some pictures of it. Resulting in the present review. Along with this I made my first ever poll. Here we go: First, some data: Setnumber: 6399 Setname: Airport Shuttle Released in: 1990 in Holland, though Bricklink says 1991 Number of parts: 731 Number of figs: 9 Price: unknown, prices on Bricklink vary from $261 up to $2300 (!) but this was an expensive set even in the nineties The box: Mine is a bit battered by the owner before me, but there's still plenty to see. This is one of the largest boxes I have (look at the minifig in the down-right corner for the comparision) and it is a really neat storing facility for many sets. The box shows the set, and in the background the silhouet of the set that is to accompany this one: the airport from 1990. I like the angle of the box, showing the two stations, track and train in one picture. The back of the box shows some really nice ideas for other setups, why oh why has Lego abandonned this kind of showing what's possible with one set...? Inside flap of the box, showing details of the set and the functions, Detail on the front of the box, displaying the dimensions, it really is a huge track layout for one set! The instructions: there is a nice little booklet showing the same picture as the box art with the figures lined up underneath. The last page nicely folds out to show the entire setup of the tracks, The figures: A brilliant selection of minifigs including airport people and a cook. All figures that are supposed to go on the shuttle carry a ticket and there are also some suitcases (tickets fit inside, of course) Station # 1: The set includes two stations. Here is the first, depicting the airport. There are lots of details: a phonebooth, two seats, some flowers, a map, luggagelockers and of course the streetlights. A detailed shot of the station showing the luggagelockers and ticket-validating machine, Part of the beauty of this set is the fact that it is so extremely detailed, just look at the signs to show where to go next (stickers), and the scenery opposite the street... The station has the same shape as the Airport Shuttle logo, how sweet is that? The station pictured as part of the layout. The stations ends are made with airplane wings to smoothen the arrival of the shuttle. Station # 2: Here is the second station, my personal favorite: An elevated stop with a little snackbar underneath and stairs leading to the platform. Some chairs and streetlights here as well plus two old fashioned trees, The part of the set that can be used in any layout: the snackbar with hamburger sign (sticker). Yes, those hamburgers look tasty indeed! Also notice the lights hanging from the platform overhead and the ticket-validating machine at the bottom of the stairs. Here we have the platform with information panels and seats. Also notice the two trafficlights for the train. Here's how it works: the train will travel in the direction the arrow is pointing. When turning the knob the two grey blocks will move towards or away from the track-center, activating a button on the centerpiece of the train (the motor) which makes the train start it's journey around the track. There is only one speed and the train can only be put to a stop or change direction at stations. The station as part of the layout. The Shuttle: Now on with the train: There are two carrriages connected to a centered motor. the power is provided by means of a batterybox containing a 9v battery. The batterybox is in one of the carriages and displays: Airport Shuttle. A total of five passengers can be seated inside leaving room for their luggage and two drivers. The front carriage with the button for the batterybox showing. The underside showing the gearwheel (metal) that brings the power from the motor onto the geared track. The black pointy things alongside the gear-wheel react with the direction knobs at stations. This is how the shuttle negociates with height differences, everything hinges and rotates, making the shuttle capable of performing steep climbs. The motor is powerful enough to not slow down at such a climb! Detailed shot, showing the first set of covered wheels in hinged position. The shuttle on the layout. The full layout: This layout is quite huge, involving lots of track pieces, ramps, ten large stanchion-poles and the two stations. To show the movement of the shuttle I have made a 20 second movie, which can be seen in My Brickshelf gallery of this set. Conclusion: Well, to conclude the review, some final thoughts: This truly is one of the more detailed sets around (at least from the nineties) and one of the largest in dimensions. The monorail system is cleverly thought out and works excellent. Track extensions are hard to get however and very expensive nowdays (especially the switchpoints and long straight track pieces). The tracks included with this set will provide you with hours of fun though, because there are a lot of them. It can be quite hard to incorporate the monorail in your town without having a clearly-based-on-the-monorail-alone town. I tried to incorporate it some years ago (link here), posing a real challenge. The Ratings: Price: 8/10: this is an expensive set, if you can get it for under $200 get it!), this set is rare in any condition. Parts: 10/10: lots of rare pieces, cool minifigs, 9v system, roadplates, lots of minifigseats en red trainwindows. Originality: 10/10: there are very few monorails released, this one being the only town set. Compatibility: 8/10: can be a bit hard to incorporate in a town, but hey: you got the monorail so no complaining here! Total: 36/40: I can only reccommend this set to anyone, It is my personal favorite set upto this present time! If there are any questions, ask them, all comments are welcome of course!"

No question this set is one of the all-time-beauties. I rated outstanding of course. I never hat the chance to get a complete copy of this set, but I do own the engine and quite a bunch of monorail tracks. Your very detailed review made me think of getting the whole set some day. Thank you very much for this! I never realized there were so many details included to this set: The snackbar and the telephone cell and all the other nice things. Really strange for a nineties set which often lacked details. The only thing that comes to my mind right now is that the engine looks quite blocky. If the set was released today, TLC would use more of those parts which make a better design imo. And it would fit better to the curved walls of the stations as well.

The elevated city station is much more complex than it looks, and the whole set is extremely detailed. The good: - As stated in the review, there's a lot of track, roughly twice as much as the last monorail made, 6991. 5 long straights too! - the designers didn't need to put in the hamburger stand or the ticket readers, but they did and made it even better - Great figure selection; airport workers as well as civilians The bad (if you can call it that in such a great set): - Hard to incorporate into an existing town if using the default track layout. The center loop would be inaccessible to vehicles and the layout is very large. - The monorail needs nearly a full straight section on either side of the city station or it will impact the corner of the station and stall if a curve is too close. - As far as I know the only town set with road plates that doesn't have a wheeled vehicle. A car would have been nice, a bus would have been incredible. But these small things in no way diminish from the fact that this is one of the best sets ever.

I got my copy years ago from a guy on the old rec.toys.lego newsgroup (anybody here still remember that newsgroup??). I traded him a Guarded Inn, a Black Falcon's Fortress, and a couple other small castle sets for it. No regrets on that trade. It is hard to incorporate a monorail into a town, especially if you have a bunch of trains too! I ended up making my entire monorail system elevated. There's just no easy way to make a monorail / road crossing. I also gave up on having it run in a loop. Instead, it runs back and forth between two endpoints."

Personally I’ve only seen this set in the flesh once in my life when I was a child just before it was withdrawn from sale. It is a lovely set, well made and well produced though I think there is a flaw and that’s when the passages get of the other end of their train ride what picks them up, a bus set for the airport would have been a good addition. Apart from that I can’t really fault it and that fact it comes with three female minifigs is just stellar. As for incorporation, keeping it elevated seems the most sensible suggestion. I’ve always thought it I have it and wanted to integrate the set to a town to use it in the style of the DLR in London, but that’s just a thought."

This truck was introduced in the same year that LEGO came up with the garbage bins that of course also appear in this set. Have you ever wondered why most of the time the streets of LEGO City are so clean and neat? No litter, no garbage everywhere, no chewinggum on the streets. Even with so many different inhabitants, it seems to always stay that way. However, the older AFOLs amongst us, have experienced totally different situations: rubbish everywhere, smelly and dirty looking pavements, minifigs that were losing their standard grin. That is why LEGO came out with this magnificent truck back in 1987. Before that, people needed to put there garbage in bags or maybe barrels. From that year on, every miniman and miniwoman is happily using a trash bin. The minifig civil servants never seem to become tired and the Garbage truck comes every other day to collect the rubbish and keep the city clean. The secret behind the clean LEGO city and the always happy 'standard grin' of our minifolks are the anti-litter warriors that use their powerful machines and handy tools to just get the job done! So if you don't own a garbage truck, better try to get one, before your standard grins also fade and your streets become as dirty as Naples (where the garbage collectors recently had a strike for quite some time). An overview of the set including instructions (actually one is included in the set). Unfortunately I afraid we don't have any boxes of this set left. Another image of the LEGO items in the set. It shows the truck, two civil servants to perform the waste collection duties, two garbage bins and a broom and shovel. The two chaps that always seem to smile, even when the litter that they collect really stinks. The accessories that accompany the set. A broom and a shovel to help cleaning up in case a dustbin tips over. A very nice feature of the set is that the elevator at the back can be lifted in more or less the same way that real garbage trucks do. As you can see here, the dustbin is emptied through a red 'train window'. (It seems to be that the hinges of my version will need some 'revision'.) Panels inside the back of the truck maximize waste capacity for this 4 stud wide truck. It is nice that the designers added this simple red round brick on a clip. Presumably it should depict cylinders to let the back compartment tip for emptying or otherwise it might be gastanks. Again the complete set. It is very complete set but some additions could make it even more playable: - garbage (e.g. a green flower bottom or some round plates 1 x 1) - a place for the second worker to position himself on, when the trucks needs to drive to the dumpsite or an other street and also vertical bars for that second worker to hold himself by. This is what the truck will look like when dumping the litter at the recycle plant or dump site, the whole back nicely tilts, so that all the litter will fall out of the truck. A view on the back of the truck. Quite a small but yet effective opening. The front of the truck. Only one seat for just the driver, but I personally prefer that to a 6 wide truck that fills the total width of the streets and has problems with corners. Of course set 7991 (The orange garbage truck of last year) is also nice, we also own some of those but we never put them in our LEGO Town since they take too much room and the color scheme of 6693 is also more preferable to us. The two panels with the printed recycling pattern are a bit worn so we might recreate the recycle logo and put it on a sticker some day. Playability: 8/10 (Like I mentioned it is too bad that the set doesn't have any litter [however LEGO also saw that and has put litter in the 6693 set]) Design: 9/10 (a really nice truck with two minifigs and very nice details) Price: -/10 (I was not able to get any price information, at bricklink one can still obtain a 2nd hand one for about 25$.) Overall: 8/10 (a set that should be entitled a 'classic' in the same list as the pizza restaurants, the 7750 and the blacksmith shop) That was all the pictures I was allowed to take since it seems that those brave man still have quite some trash cans to empty. Thanks guys for doing the dirty work so our minifigs stay happy and our streets stay clean! Peeron Lugnet Brickset: Bricklink entries Additional notes on the review: My brother has always been keen on garbage trucks. However when he became aware of this truck it wasn't available in the stores anymore. Newer sets that had the 'recycling theme' we not that good. They didn't have the emptying mechanism. So after our dark ages, one of the first sets we bought, were some of those nice refuse collection trucks. Although the new orange truck has the desired mechanisms and thankfully is a decent garbage truck, we more like 4 wide trucks than 6 studs wide trucks, so for the years to come our LEGO town inhabitants will still be seeing this great truck to control their waste problems."

Like many such town sets, I would characterise it as cute. Contrasting it to the new bin lorry, it's nice that this set has two minfigs (more realistic) and two bins. Those bins are a great addition to Lego, although wheelie bins would be nice now (need some kind of 2x2 container you can clip a plate onto as a hinging lid, and clip mini-wheels under the back two studs). Having two minifigs is a superior point for this earlier Lego rendition of a bin lorry. In fact, even though our bins are now emptied by a private company rather than the local council (as was the case up till the mid 90s), and of course for the last two decades there have been wheelie-bins, bin lorries have three guys - the driver and two collectors. However, our bin collectors for sure don't use a broom or shovel! Indeed on occasion they've befouled the street themselves if something goes wrong with hoisting the bin on the mechanism! The shape of the lorry in the set is still quite accurate, pretty good for a four-wide vehicle (I must admit to preferring the newer vehicles)."

The box The box is standard for it's time, with silver font. The background on the front has some planets and the Death Star II, clarifying that this set is from episode VI. Overview This set comes with the Interceptor model and one fig. The Interceptor has a very sleek, futuristic design, with four wings and a ball-shaped cockpit. The TIE Interceptor is a stealthy, speedy vehicle in the Imperial fleet. It is used for scouting missions, and not meant for attacking due to it's weak structure and low arsenal. Front This version of the TIE group is very attractive and cool-looking. It has an aerodynamic shape, giving it looks and speed. While not accurate to the movie's grey and black colored TIEs, the blue in place of the grey is just fine, and does not alter the ""coolness"" of the design. Thankfully, there are no stickers in this set. Cockpit Here you can see the ball-shaped cockpit. Be very, very careful when opening it; it's very flimsy and breaks off almost every time. Fortunately, both the windshield and the dish on top are printed, and not stickers. Please don't mind the dust. Cockpit Interior This is the inside of the cockpit. It is very roomy, airtight, and one of the few cockpits in SW sets that are this good. It makes up for lack of detail by giving the pilot plenty of room, so you should have no trouble there. It is also very smooth in the back and where the windshield folds down. This is by far the best SW cockpit I have ever seen done by TLG, good job! The only bad thing is the two tan bricks that clash with the rest of the color. Wing attachment This is how the wings are attached to the cockpit on each side. Unfortunately, the design on this part is not so good, and sometimes the wings break off. Plus, this part is very blocky, and there is a big juniorized piece on the base of the wings. Wings Here is what each wing looks like. There are three parts on each wing: a middle and two fins. The wings are very aerodynamic, with a diamond-like design. Note the Imperial insignias and the blue tiles lining the wings. Wing attachments cont'd Here, again, you see how the middle wing part is attached to the base (juniorized piece), and the fins attached to the base by hinges. The hinges allow the fins to fold in and out a bit, but again, this is very fragile, and the fins often break off. Gun placements This is an example of four guns on the ship, one on the tip of each fin. The guns consist of a tile with a Tenic tunnel hole on the bottom attached to a Technic pin, which is attached to a black bar. A good design altogether. Back Here you see the rear of the cockpit. You can see why the opening mechanism is so flimsy: the whole top and front is connected to the body only by a weak hinge system, as seen in the picture. Also note the small, trans-blue dish and the four trans-red studs. Minifigure Finally, here is the single figure that comes in this set, a TIE Pilot. It is an all black figure, with a life support system decal on the front and a helmet with silver Imperial insignias. An overall good minifig, with a different helmet mold than the Stormtrooper or Shadowtrooper. Well, I suppose that's about all, let's get to the FINAL VERDICT: Build: 6/10, a little difficult due the flimsiness of the ship, but should only take the average builder no more than 30 minutes. Playability: 7/10, it's fun to fly around ( ), but has no real functions. Swooshability: 7/10, you can swoosh it around fairly well, just be careful not to accidentally break it. Minifigs: 8/10, a good fig, although having only one leaves something more to be desired. Design: 4/10, very, very flimsy with the wings, windshield, and fins, but good for display. Price: 7/10: I think it was actually 30 USD when I got it, but I'm not sure... Overall Score: 6.5, an average set. Very delicate, so much that you can hardly pick it up, but good for display. The minifig is okay, and having no stickers is good. I would recommend this to a hardcore OT fan. That wraps it all up, please vote your opinion on this set in the poll, and I'll see you next review!

I've added it to the index. This is one of my favourite Ties and I think TLG did a good job at designing it.

One time at the Dutch LEGOWorld event we had three of those there with flashing lights and loud sirens trying to put out the fire that was caused by the crash of again some LEGO aircraft. We never had this set before our drak ages and the sets probably came from ebay or so. In my opinion the newest Airport rescue is nice too but in the conclusion I will make some additional remarks about that. Just imagine what it would be like for your LEGO town if the pilot of one of your smaller planes, just couldn't stop before the end of the runway. Here you see the disaster that happened some day in our town: Fortunately all passengers got out safely thanks to our brave fire fighters. This magnificent truck was used to help putting out the fierce fire caused by the aviation gas from the small plane. The set includes two firefighters in distinguishable airport uniforms. In order to be able to safe the passengers and go for a quick intervention, our brave firemen have an axe for each of them, airtanks and a portable fire extinguisher. Here you see the truck on the right side. The large spout on the roof really makes it a remarkable truck. As you can see, behind the red door, there is space for the airtank of our brave firemen, at the right there is also place for the small hand held extinguisher. The left side of the truck has a water hose instead. For a truck from 1991 there is quite some room inside. Actually both firemen fit inside. Unfortunately there is only one seat. At the back there are two clips for the axes. There you can also find the main switch for the light and sound system. As you can see, the red flashing lights, do their job quite well. The sirene is just behind the bar with the flashing lights. The main spout just seems to begin emitting water. The front of the truck. For some reason there are two hidden spouts there as well. What their purpose is seems unclear but they look nice. KimT suggests that it is for foaming the runway and that is a real option of course. This set can be found on: Peeron Lugnet Brickset Bricklink entries Playability: 8/10 (Very nice set, details that are movable and of course the light and sound) Design: 8/10 (nice sets with nice details, but could have even been better: seat for 2nd fireman missing, no oxigen masks and only one airtank) Price: 7/10 (For a light and sound set and two firefighters, the price is reasonable I would say.) Overall: 8/10 (nice sets, some details could even be better, too bad that there is only a five to choose from a sticker when you have more than one truck) Last but not least an overview of the complete set including instructions. ""Fire mastered"" as the Dutch firefighters will say when they have completed their job. We have also bought the newer airport rescue truck (7891). However we think this 6440 one is much better. The light and sound, all the nice features and the nice details are much better than the new truck. Edited by JopieK, 11 September 2008 - 10:25 AM."

Somehow, I had just noticed your reply. To be honest with you, the AES in my country does not have front spouts in their fire engine. I do not remember seeing this feature before. It is a possibility that this feature is included in some models or an imaginative addition from our LEGO designers. I will need to check this out.

Box back: no alternate models, but ""Designed for easy building and istant play"". I still wonder if today's kids are lazier or dumber than my generation... Box content: 2 bags, loose car base, instructions, stickers. (not so) Random manual page: the evolution of SNOT tecnique on car lights. Set inventory: split into 2 pages! Stickers: Red Cross has gone a long time ago; here's Caduceus. Loose pieces: we're ready to start! Minifig and accessories: ""What's up, Doc?"" M.I.P. (Most Interesting Piece): it's SNOT time! Building starts: and it's fast and easy Notes: car has doors! and that black plate with rail helps so that the roof doesn't only weight on the windscreen. Complete model: top view ""Container Cupboards"": that's where Doc puts its accessories when driving. Sticker time: see the difference, with and without. Review and rating. Do you remember when Lego cars had doors? It seems so long ago... The car is simple; but as well as a set can be designed, this one doesn't look so realistic (isn't it what Lego has been doing over the last few years? Going realistic?) Doc is OK, but I guess many people would have wanted a female fig (and: brown eyebrows with black hair? that's odd ) As I said, no Red Cross, but a politically correct Caduceus on the roof and sides. Extra pieces: 1 small antenna and 1 1x1 decorated tile. Overall, a cheap way to own a doctor minifig and a nice vehicle to add to your town. Just above average. Rating: 3.5/5"

Long before my dark ages LEGO released this relatively small set. since they didn't have a construction site like nowadays, they released these small road-works. I was only six years old and really into small sets since my ADHD didn't allow me to sit and build for long periods of time. So these smaller sets were ideal for me. The instruction booklet. The complete set. The set itself is not really a surprise to set up and play with. First you'll build the smaller parts of the set like the container and the small verhicle. No real surprises there, except for the smaller car that fits perfectly in the cargo container. Just pull off the seat and steering wheel, and the car just fits. The crane itself is just as easy to build as the smaller parts. just place bricks on top of eachother. Although you'll still have the wire to connect and pull through a diversity of bricks and plates. The carco container and small car. Being out of my dark ages really tunnelled my vision toward bigger sets and completing my town. This set really comes in handy if i need construction or traffic workers in my town, I can just MOC a few containers for tearing down trees, fixing traffic lights, and so on. Behold the mighty cargomaster crane! It's pretty easy to say that a set as simplistic as this one is not much fun to play with. However if you see the bigger potential in your town this one could be of great value to any city. Playability: 7/10 (with only one container it gets a bit boring) Design: 9/10 (it's small, and fits perfectly) Price: 7/10 (Average, but not really cheap.) Overall: 7.7/10 (a nice overall set if you're building on minifig scale) Gimme my pizza!

It's one of the most amazing older city sets, thus making it a really valuable review. This is the story about four handsome firemen living in one of the most amazing city structures out there. The 6389 Fire control center. The box I actually didn't remember the box to be that small. (Borrowed from Peeron) The four hunky firemen Oh jeah what women doesn't like a man in a uniform The manual Even the manual is aging... but then again it's 17 years old! Review As you all know a city must have some standard civil services, like a hospital and a police station. A fire house also is a must for any lego city. This particular fire house is one of the most amazing sets ever to be released. In this cool set you get 4 minifigs, all fire fighters, two verhicles, and a helicopter Firefighters have to move around The futuristic fire truck is definately my favourite! Chief's car The smallest verhicle of the set, it's a small all-terrain jeep for the fire chief. pretty much a standard car in those days. a real simple layout, and a trunk which holds a small fire hose. It's lucky to be in this set, because it complements the whole thing The car Luckily it's red and it has de cool signs on the side. Helicopter Another great addition to the whole set is the helicopter. Again in a basic setup for that kind of verhicle at the time. This one has the nice addition of two hoses to put out the fires raging in lego city. The chopper No, it doesn't really fly Really cool fire truck thingy This fire truck is definately the best of the verhicles in this set. It's actually a futuristic model of fire trucks. I haven't seen any other fire truck like this. I saw a police truck like it though. but we're talking fire fighters right? Actually the whole thing han open up to reveal a number of fire fighting appliances such as a hose, a computer, and a oxygen tank. The fire truck click for bigger version! The main building actually looks kinda empty when the trucks and chopper are gone. However, this still is realistic compared to a real fire house. Also the front has those amazing sliding doors, which make this thing really look cool and clean. Off to fight a fire Main structure, with the slinding doors pulled down Actually those sliding doors are also the hard part of the model. Since all the bricks must be perfectly aligned, or else the doors will stutter. But if you're a little familiar with lego then you don't need to worry. From the back Enough room to play with I'm going to give my perspectives on each of the sides On the left we have the garage for the bigger fire truck. The only real flaw about this set is that this garage isn't long enough for the fire truck. This could have been solved by making it two or three studs longer. Notice the cool sunroof! In the middle we have the chief's office. complete with coffee machine, a diversity of computers, and a tape recorder, most likely to tape any incoming calls. A lot of details are crammed up in there. just like in the rest of the set. To the right is the helicopter platform. I really like the grey-blue-yellow of the platform because it doesn't look so red anymore. Don't get me wrong, red is a cool color, but not too much red! And the helicopter actually fits, and stays in place during playtime. The baseplate filled up This picture says it all. Again the four lego hunks are greeting all the ladies The minifigs are from a classic series, this happens with more of my lego sets. Bottom line is that this set is one of the best fire houses lego created. Verdict The build is pretty easy but takes a while to really see where you are with your building. It's nice to have a hospital from the same era, this create a more uniform look to your city. once you completed the model your baseplate is pretty filled up but still has a lot of opportunities. Playability: 10/10 (cool trucks, a chopper, and sliding doors, nuff said!) Design: 9/10 (insanely good design) Price: 10/10 (couldn't get better than this) Overall: 9.6/10 with a score like that one can only say... get one... NOW! Time to go home The trucks and chopper back on their rightful spots"

The newer 6571 station is better in some ways, but I always liked the big airport-style fire engine in this and the windows covering the garages. One mod project I have in mind is to expand the base, adding a second room in the area beneath the control center. Interestingly, this set had two different box pictures. There was the original 1989 yellow Legoland box and a 1991 blue System box, and the blue box has the vehicles in different places.

Just 25 years after its release. The instructions for a total of five models, two of them printed, the other 3 are just photo instructions in the book. It still has the box in good shape, despite some wear from the age. Sadly five little pieces were missing, and 5 wrong pieces inside instead (2 complete wheels and a classic 80s-90s plane wing (dumped into my bricks). But I was able to replace the missing Minifig torch and the 4 missing plates with identical pieces from my collection. The Box and Contents The set still has the original box. Inside the pieces, plastic insert, instructions and a 1987 Technic catalogue, imagine that set livespan today. Four years and the 8841 is still in the catalogue. Classic technic design from early 80s showing a function drawing of the Steering and the main model A small set, but with a flap shoeing the contents. All pieces in the inner box and the papers included. 5th Model: Soapbox Racer This is more or less a soapbox racer with working steering, but no engine. It's got a rather blocky design, but still looks sleek enough and is a simple build little over 100 pcs out of 180. The Soapbox at step 2 Just included the steering at step 6 Completed and ready to race downhill. Total: 7/10 Simple, but effective 4th Model: Simple Chassis very simple and boring alternate using just 1/3 of the 180 pieces in the set. It even hasn't got a seat construction. It's just a plain steering mechanism attached on wheels with a spartan chassis of just a few pieces. This is the whole model at step 5 Just attach the steering mechanism and wheels and you're done Total: The worst alternate model of the complete set. Just a boring 4/10 3rd Model: Balance Very original small model. It's a small model of a working classic Balance. And it works with small parts laid on the scales, altough they've got just a 4x4 Footprint. IT's a fast build. just 15 minutes and you've done it. The model as it looks at step 3 Finished. Easy build with just 63pcs out of 180 Total: Very original model, it actually works with small weights, but a very simple build. Still a 7/10 Alternate Model: Tractor with equipment This is the second model. It's a simple but boxy design featuring a harrow and a plough. The tractor has a similar design to the very first tractor set, but much smaller. The plough is about 24-wide and the harrow is completely SNOTTED even back in 1983. Has two functions: Working steering and the coupler for the equipment. Uses almost all pieces of the set. The tractor at step 8, the steering isn't completely attached now This is the completed tractor The complete harrow Finished alternate with the plough attached. Total: Nice, but quite ugly and boxy design for a tractor with 4 wheels of the same size. Takes me to a 6/10 Main Model: Desert Racer This is the main model, with a nice (for early 80s) but boxy design. It has two functions. Steering and a working 1-cylinder rear engine, which is of the old 2x2 piston type, since the small piston design wasn't invented back then. This is the only model of the set, which has piece callouts in the instructions. The printed alternate model has no callouts, they weren't invented on both models back in 1983. The three smaller photo instruction alternates have a piece callout at the beginning showing all needed pieces. The seat is a nice, but blocky design and use a primitive SNOT technique. This is the model at step five. The piston is already attached. Imagine this state on step 5 in modern sets. Back then LEGO had challenging instructions, not the step madness like today This is the engine just made of plates with a hole in the middle for the piston Step 9. The piston engine is completed. On step 12 the roll bar and the seat are installed. Only the steering isn't completed yet. Front view of the finished model. Just 15 steps needed back then. Bird's eye view of the whole set Displayed on the box Model Verdict: Nice design, especially the colorful seat in SNOT technique, but quite boxy especially the engine, since there were only the huge pistons. Still a 9/10 Set Verdict: Design and Models: 7/10, very boxy designs, due to the age. The chassis alternate sucks Build: 9/10 Classic 80s technic building. Quite challenging but fun Sturdyness: 7/10: rear section damaged after the table fall, but rather easily fixed Fun: 9/10 Blast from the past. Overall: 8/10 mfg Widdi Edited by Widdi, 07 September 2008 - 04:11 PM."

Actually I got my first 77-series back in 1981 (5th of December, I was 2,5 years old) just a week before my brother was born. Some years later I got the 7740. After our Dark ages we (my brother, cousin and myself) got all 12V trains at least once. This 7725 was gathering dust in my brothers' room. The train in all its splendor. As you can see it doesn't occur at the back of the 12V era train instructions although its larger brother the 7740 does. Some investigation learned that all the sets at the back of the instructions date from 1980 so the 7725 wasn't released yet. Here you can see the front of the 7725 with the driver in the cockpit. The driver is in fact the only minifig that was included in the set. As you can see, our version of the train has a different front than the one in the instructions. Apparently the former owner used 7861 (Lighting Set (12 V)) to upgrade the train with working back- and frontlights. I like the original lights but didn't notice that the train had those double lights until I did the review. Maybe we will give the train again it's original signs and put custom LEDs in it or so so that the train can drive into two directions with accurately working lights. Another thing about the lights that puzzle me are the Backlights. While typing this I realise that the former owner might have added those, so let's have a look at the instructions then. As it turns out, the lights are there also in the instructions. I recently learned that only the last car or coach of a train has it's red lights on. So unless the train drives with only the front car it will never use those red backlights. Here you can see the cockpit with the engineer. The cables don't look very pretty but well, the train at least has working light. Here you can take a look at the inside of the engine car. While the 7745 has a nice 'fake engine' there, just the weight bricks and the ugly cables, apart from the engineer and his cockpit, no other nice features here. B.t.w. LEGO always used tiles in such a trains to make it easier for kids to take off the roof and have access to the minifig passengers etc. Here the 'proof' that it is an electric train. The pantograph of the front car. It has the same kind of panthographs that the 7745 has. The middle car has 4 chairs. As you can see, some vandal must have nocked over this one. Hope they leave the cables alone. This early morning train seems to have one passenger: a workman. I like the small 2x3 windows from this car very much! They give this care a nice look. Also the door in the middle adds something special to the train. As far as I know, no other passenger train has the doors in the middle. Here you see the side of the train, just after the train has left Brickingham Station where the worker, probably from set 6647 (Highway Repair) that was also released in 1980. A closeup of the last car with steering stand to allow the train to travel back and forth without having to 'make head', in other words: putting the engine in front again. The train, shunted to an end track so it can be cleaned (I think it is apparent that it definitely needs cleaning very badly). This set can be found on: Peeron Lugnet Brickset Bricklink entries Playability: 5/10 (The train is fine, but with only one minifig not very playable without other sets; also no accessories at all!) Design: 7/10 (Nice train, the inside could have been a lot better, but I really like to original front lights!) Price: 7/10 (the train came with motor so not a bad price, goes now for quite some money at eBay.) Overall: 6.5/10 (nice set but the 7745 is a better train I'm sure) Well that was it for today. I hope you have enjoyed this review and got tears in your eyes seeing how nice the 12V era was... It never comes back, but maybe LEGO rereleases some of this sets in the 2009+ train era (very likely that this is just wishful thinking). Edited by JopieK, 12 September 2008 - 04:56 PM."

You know, I was wondering how LEGO could justify having two 12V-powered passenger trains at the same time, but after reading the review, and seeing the lack of figures and accessories, I guess I understand why (plus the train is rather compact). Oh, and I can't help but think that the chairs in the middle carriage are somewhat oddly placed, because those placed next to the door are unusable because the door takes up room needed for figs' arms. Also, it appears that your set also has the newer couplers, i.e. there's no hooks for the decoupling rail to grab hold of. With the light assembly it really won't matter, play-wise, or if you don't have any decouplers, but it's still a bit of a bummer."

That's not the one I was thinking of, it was the other two chairs towards the middle of the wagon that I was thinking of. If you try to seat a minifig in either of them, you'll quickly find that it's impossible, beacuse the door interferes with the figs' required personal space. If you move both of them one stud forward (so that the back of the seat lines up with the edge of the window), it'll solve the problem, and still leave space for a figs to be seated in the other chairs."

The new theme offered great colors including orange, tan, and light blue; which immediately caught my eye. The theme focussed on island fun with some adventure, and included some great figs like the Brickster. I had to buy at least one set choosing Truck & Stunts Trike (review coming soon) at the time. The theme was short lived and many of the sets were on sale at discount toy stores not too long after their initial release. I picked up this set, 6445 Beach Cruisers for $3.33 (USD), which will be my first of three Island Xtreme Stunt reviews. Starting with the box, a race between the Street Surfer and Skate Boarder: The back shows some alternate models including a sail boat and jet ski: Same image on the instructions as the box: But the backside shows the Island Xtreme Stunts video game for different platforms: The set includes a small decal sheet for the skateboard: I love the two figs included within this set. One is a ""hippie-type"" with shades and leafed muscle short, and the other ""Pizza Boy"" skateboarder. Check out the ""Pizza Boy"" on his skateboard: Two green brackets are included for attaching each fig to the long grey bar. Using this piece, one can make the skateboarder do tricks and flips. The ""street surfer"" vehicle is pretty nice to: The sail is placed on a black bar and lance, then attached to the vehicle: Here's a picture of the vehicle. To me, it has that old ""soap box derby"" look to it - like something kids would create to race down a hill: The vehicle doesn't have a steering wheel, but rather two levers which I think work well in the cockpit: Here's the underside: The set has three neon orange wheels that attach to technic axle pins to attach to the vehicle: Lastly, the entire set with a few extra pieces: Final Thoughts While Island Xtreme Stunts is not the best City/Town sub-theme, esp. for the traditional Lego Classic Town fan, it does have some fun sets like this little beach cruiser. Good figs, a skateboard, and a very ""rollable"" (fun word equivalent to ""swooshable"" but for vehicles with wheels), vehicle. You can even blow on the sail to get it to roll across the floor. This set is a lot of FUN!"

However, I do remember the existence of its video games. Look like an interesting set for great outdoor enterainment and fun for LEGO citizens whom is out for real thrill and excitement. This theme never really got me excited back then. After reading your review, it's quite useful for some new addition to your town features, such as including a skater boy, holding the pizza instead of using the pizza van. The high fuel cost must have caught up to them, to resort using skate board for delivery. As for the street surfer vehicle, it's a cool looking vehicle with unique construction. Pardon me, I have not seen such design before. I will actually tear off the wheels, cover up the sides and used it for wind surfing! That's the whole idea. After giving some thoughts and weighs its factors, I will have to give it a ""3"" for this set. I will probably get it if its on sales.

You decide, with Island Xtreme Stunts Air Chase. Set #: 6735 Theme: Island Xtreme Stunts Year Released: 2002 Piece Count: 83 Minifigs: 2 List Price: $10 (USD) A nice addition to the Island Xtreme Stunts theme, Air Chase includes two air vehicles; a seaplane and hang glider. The set has nice Island colors inclusing white, light blue, and orange. Also includes in the set are some great chrome pieces for the Brickster's airplane wings. Starting with the box. You can see Hippie Dude in close pursuit: The back of the box depicts some nice alternate jet skis: Same front box picture on the instructions: And on the backside, pictures of the video game: Air Chase includes two nicely detailed figs, Hippie Dude (for lack of his official name), and the Brickster: Here's a picture of the orange hang-glider: And the underside: Unfortunately, the hang-glider is too heavy to be held up by a minigig. While I like the brick-built glider for the extra pieces, the plastic wing pieces from the Ninja theme would have worked effectively and be a lot lighter. I think the seaplane is the best part of the set: Here's a shot of the front end. I like the skeletal shark/fish design. What's great is none of the pieces use stickers. They are all printed: Including the tail end: Although the cockpit has no steering wheel or lever piece, it does have a very nice printed 1x2 tile: The wings of the airplane have hinges to allow them to fold inward slightly: Also notice the nice chrome/silver pieces. Here's a shot of the underside of the seaplane: And lastly, the complete set: Final Thoughts: Air Chase is another one of those ""fun"" Island sets. Two figs with two vehicles make a perfect combination for creating some dog-fights in the air. At the same time, the Brickster's plane can land in the water to explore other adventure play opportunities. This set is also a nice addition to the Island Xtreme Stunts Truck & Stunt Trikes (6739). The seaplane can be hauled by the large semi-truck included within 6739. Hope you enjoy this review."

I loved this theme, it had some of the greatest pieces ever arranged in any theme, brilliant printed parts and figures, and some good colours. Snap Lockitt (Hippie Dude ) is a great figure with a cool name, I own him from another set, but unfortunately not this one. It looks like a very good set, no stickers and good printed parts too. Nice review. Hahaha. That made me laugh for some reason... I don't know why though, I agree with it. I have him as well, I got him from the orange jet-ski set."

It fascinates me that those are actual printed parts. That's something we don't see too often anymore. The figures are very good, although I must say I like the name Hippie Dude better than Snap Lockitt. Does anyone know why the Brickster has one blue hand? Thanks for the great review!

The idea of this set is good, and I like the mostly yellow minifig, but the design of both the airplane (weird 'window'-piece, a propellor that is way too small, minimal skies underneath and a strange colourscheme) and the hangglider (two handlebars on the wings, too many colours) makes the set mark the essence of LEGO's downfall during those years. I really appreciate the fact that you made a review of this set, Brickster, it made me look into the details of 6735, but I am just as sure today as I was back then: I will never buy this. Anyway, thanks for the review, the quality of the set may be a disapointment your review certainly is not"

This is a very small set which is slightly bigger than the current impulse set. It's part of the Race theme which involved in land and sea racers back in the early 1990s. I just love these orignal race themes which is produced back then. Name: Glade Runner Theme: LEGO System / Town / Race Year: 1993 Pieces: 29 Minifigs: 1 Price: USD$3.25 An image of a 6513, Glade Runner Swamp race shall begins This glade runner is pretty nice looking with its sleek sports look. Well, for a glade runner in the water, it certainly looks much impressive. Somehow, I felt that the 6513 is aligned with the 6514 Trail Ranger. I always had that perception that both vehicles are brothers and was released under the same year. In fact, Glade Runner was released in 1993 based on Peeron information. I always felt that this set is used for Investigators or Police to used for tracking or search purposes in the swamp areas instead of using it for a race. I will place this set in the jungle, somewhere like Brickster's jungle settings. Although it looks too bright for such serious agenda, but I think it's pretty useful to use it this way. They can rent it from the nearby shop and used it to search. It kind of reminded me of the movie, US Marshals which acted by Tommy Lee Jones and Wesley Snipes. Meet the ace Please pardon his trousers. I did not bleach it earlier. (It was caused overtime without adequate caring to the minfig. Look at this great article on how to protect your LEGO!) The driver wears a green vest with patch pockets on both sides. This is my favourite design during that period. It comes with a yellow lifevest too. As for the 1x4 printed tile with 3 stars shining in front of the runner, it's a very nice printed tile that can be used for other racing purposes in other sets as well. Overall design The built is very simple and yet so realistic. Making use of the aeroplane tailhead to add as the holder for the rotor is smart. The white bricks acting as a platform for both sides to hold the driver to sit onto the centre with the steering wheel at the front. I am very happy with this design. Place the glade runner in front of the fan with a reasonable fan speed. You will see the rotor runs like a charm. Different angles of the vehicle Close encounter with the ""Swamp Sharks"" coined by Brickster! See you later To conclude, this is a very nice little set that can provide much fun. I don't really used it to race in the waters. Instead, I leave it to my imagination and used it for police investigation purposes such as air crash excerise, search and rescue operations and etc. I think it can provides quite a fun loving experience. Although, the set might not be very appealing to some people, but I find it very fun to play around and is one of my favourite sets in the 1990s where I placed it with my 6514 Trail Ranger together. Summary review Playability: 8.5/10 (I leave it to your imagnination.) Design: 9/10 (Very simple yet realistic design.) Price: 10/10 (A very inexpensive set. Great way to buy such small sets at a low price.) Overall: 8.5/10 (Glade Runner is not common in Town and City theme. It's not a must to have it, but if you ever come across it. Do get it) I gave it a ""4"" based on my Review Score Card. What about yours? Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. Comments and Critics are strongly welcomed.

This really reminds me of an ""All-American"" set with its Red, White, and Blue Colors (and the white stars). Although I really like the fig with its scruffy bearded face, I find the green torso a bit odd for this set. I suppose I would expect some sort of red/blue racer fig with a white/blue racing helmet. Swamp Sharks - too funny! . You always add a nice addition of humor to your reviews. Now I'm going to check out some Wonder Woman clips on YouTube."

Well, I didn't want to find out, so I bought this set straight away! 7991 Recycle Truck Set Info Set Name: 7991 Recycle Truck Released: 2007 Theme: City Price: USD 14.99-GBP 12.99-EUR 14.95 Pieces: 206 Minifigs: 1 Review Time! Leading off, the box The front shows the recycle man loading up... The trash can? One thing here is really bizarre. On LEGO S@H and everywhere else, it says that this set is called Recycle Truck. Which makes sense as it has a recycle logo on the truck. However, on my box, it says the set is called Garbage Truck Has this happened to anyone else? Or is it just me... Here is the back of the box which shows some of the things you can do with this set. The Bags With this set you get 3 bags which are numbered. And do you see what I see? Yes, that's right, the DSS is in a bag so it doesn't get bent! Why TLG doesn't do this more often is beyond me... Bag #1 The set comes with a very nice selection of pieces. A large number of these are orange. Manual Silly me, I forgot to take a picture of the front of the manual. The picture is the same as on the front of the box. The back shows some of the 2007 city sets in a nice little scene. And inside. Minifig Here is the friendly garbage/recycle man. He looks nice but with the same head as so many other city figs before him. Come on TLG! Give us some new heads! The Sticker Sheet The stickers actually are pretty decent as far as stickers go. I like the recycle sign. After Bag #1 This is where we stand after the first bag is built. Bag # 2 The parts contained in the second bag. More nice orange pieces here. Extra Parts Some nice 1x1 slopes and 1x1 round plates. Everything Built Now that everything is built, let's check it out! The design of the set is very nice and the color scheme looks great. When you see it, you immediately know what it is. The back has a droid arm that acts as a handle to dump the trash/recycling in the truck. It's simple, but works well. Here you can see the dumping mechanism. It works by a sliding technic beam with a stopper On top of the truck you can store the worker's cart. This works really well. I think though that the top of the truck overall looks a bit jumbled up with a few too many different colors. The bottom. Trash dumping time! This is a good feature of the set. A very well built SNOT front section. This looks fantastic with the grills and number plate sticker. Someone has left a big mess on the street... Brickshelf Folder Ratings! Price: 10/10 (For $15 this is a very good deal at 206 pieces) Parts: 9/10 (Lots of orange) Design 9/10 (A very well designed set. Especially the front) Playability 9/10 (The trash dumper is fun and the added broom and cart make for good play value) Build: 8/10 (Simple, but stayed interesting) Overall:45/50 Brickset LEGO S@H Bricklink Peeron Taking out the trash... Summary This is a great small set for the price with fun features, nice colors and good design. I would certainly recommend this set, no matter what it's really called Thanks, and happy building!"

I think all the boxes say Garbage Truck. I guess it's up to each builder to decide whether 1x1 round plates are recyclable material or not. It's a great model in any case. I love these highly detailed city trucks we've been getting during the last year or two. I used to have a preference for the late 80s/early 90s city line but some of these new sets have really surpassed them in detail and functionality."

This is a very nice vehicle, one of my favorite of the newer city ones. JopieK: There are two generations of road plate that are wide enough for six-wide vehicles like this. The current plates are dark grey with plain white printing, and look not great in my opinion. The previous ones are imo the best road plates of all time - green with dark grey road, white dotted line/zebras, drain covers and yellow verge markings (just like we really have here in Ireland). For urban area I would still choose the green-edged plates and just cover up the green - the markings are so much better than the current plates."

Well, the truck BARELY fits onto the old roadplates (not on curves though), so if you put it in a display it probably won't look bad.

My truck thus has that function, and with it of course the whole container tipping, disabled. I also moved the cab a bit forward and the front axle rearward to give the cab the typical garbage truck look, as they are often very low slung. This also created space behind the cab for some equipment."
